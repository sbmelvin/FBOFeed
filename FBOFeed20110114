<DESC>NOTICE OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION (NOPCA): The Contracting Branch, Cryptologic Systems Division (CPSD) intends to award on a sole source basis a fixed price contract for the procurement of technical data. This technical data shall include a Theory of Operation Manual and spare parts procurement listing for the Miniature COMSEC Unit, MCU-110A and B unit. The MCU-110A & B unit was developed by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) L-3 Telemetry West (TW), 9020 Balboa Avenue, San Diego, CA. 92123, CAGE CODE: 9U244, as a propriety product and received National Security Agency (NSA) certification as a Type-1 CRYPTO unit under the NSA Commercial COMSEC Endorsement Program (CCEP).  The proposed contract action is for supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one (1)responsible source.  The Air Force does not have complete technical data or technical expertise to compete this requirement. The lack of complete key intellectual property, specifications, schematics/drawings and parts lists prohibits the use of Full and Open Competition procedures.  L-3 TW is the only vendor with the required engineering knowledge, expertise and the complete drawing package to accomplish this requirement.  If a firm believes it is capable of meeting the Government's requirement, it may identify their interest and capability to the Contracting Specialist, Ralph Urias, 210-977-4913, ralph.urias@us.af.mil within fifteen (15) days of this publication.  Those interested firms must indicate whether they are a large, small, and small-disadvantaged, 8(a), or women owned business and whether they are U.S. or foreign owned.  See Note 22. See Note 26.

<DESC><strong>RECOVERY:</strong> THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents the intent to modify services provided by TrailBlazers Health Enterprises, LLC under contract number HHSM-500-2007-M0001Z authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS. <br /><br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub.L. 111-5) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals. <br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into the HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011.<br /><br />This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2)

<DESC>The Office of The Judge Advocate General (OTJAG) will conduct the annual leadership summit, KEYSTONE, hosted by Lt Gen Richard Harding (AF/JA) 10-22 Oct 2011 with peak attendance occurring 17-21 Oct 2011 in New Orleans, Louisiana. KEYSTONE is the USAF JAG Corps' annual leadership conference, which brings together JAG Corps leaders from around the world to achieve three primary objectives: a) to discuss and evaluate current and future leadership, organizational, and legal challenges in the Air Force and The Judge Advocate General's Corps (TJAGC); b) to develop initiatives to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of legal services in the Air Force; and c) to identify ways to maximize the Corps' readiness to support warfighter requirements. <br />KEYSTONE has been the exclusive conference venue for the JAG Corps for the past six years, replacing multiple conferences previously held by JAG Corps organizations throughout the year. Consolidating these meetings into a single Worldwide Leadership Summit has resulted in numerous efficiencies for the JAG Corps and the larger Air Force. <br />The OTJAG requires lodging, meeting rooms, audio visual and information technology support, and food and beverages in the preparation and coordination of KEYSTONE. Anticipated attendance is approximately 700 people during peak dates. Attendees will be on travel orders. Rooms, light snacks and refreshments and breakfast/lunch will be centrally funded. Rooms will be at government per diem rates. Breakfast/lunch must be provided at the partial per diem rate.<br />

NSWCCD Philadelphia is currently looking for sources that can design, furnish and test a Magazine Fire Detection/Actuation System (MFD/AS) for use aboard U.S. Navy ships. The MFD/AS is comprised of individually-addressable electronic, restorable, fixed temperature, spot-type heat detectors (includes isolator bases); spot-type photoelectric smoke detectors (includes isolator bases); spot-type ionization smoke detectors (includes isolator bases); input/output devices; a Fire Alarm Control Unit (FACU); and a Repeater Alarm Panel.
  Collectively, these components shall form a system for use in detecting magazine fire conditions and actuating a shipboard magazine fire suppression system.

Multiple FACUs on a ship, including their associated detectors and devices, shall have the capability of being networked together and connected to one or more Repeater Alarm Panels, which shall monitor and display the various alarm and trouble/fault indications that occur on the independent FACUs. The system shall operate with either grounded or ungrounded 120 VAC, single-phase, 60 Hz power and have the capability to operate output relays that shall activate fire suppression systems.  The FACU and Repeater Alarm panels shall contain  internal back-up rechargeable sealed lead acid batteries capable of full system operation in the event of loss of primary 120 VAC power.
 MFD/AS and its components shall be listed or approved in accordance with UL or EN. Additionally, all components shall meet the vibration requirements of MIL-STD-167-1, the lightweight, Grade A, Class I, Type A shock test requirements of MIL-S-901, and Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) requirements of MIL-STD-461.  In addition, heat detector response times for Navy specified fire tests shall be required to be reported.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This project will require extensive site planning and coordination between the VA engineering service, clinical staff, and AE firm. 

The scope of work design will include work on two separate floors in the building.   
1.	Construct approximately 6,200 square feet new space to expand the B100 third floor to increase the medical center's surgical operating room capacity.  The design work will include 4 new surgical operating suites as well as OR staging and support areas.  Design work will include structural, exterior finishes, expansion of all utilities, interior design, and interior finishes.  The work will include a dedicated air handler / filtration system.  
2.	Convert approximately 9,000 square feet of B100 fourth floor space to a comprehensive dental procedure clinic.  The design scope will include 18-22 dental operatories; dental / denture laboratory; and dental service administrative support offices.  

The work will cover all requirements for both the dental and surgical suite designs.  The design work will include specialized HVAC requirements and patient isolation provisions for chemotherapy treatment and infectious disease isolation. The design work will involve planning for the construction work so that there is no disruption in the adjacent medical center spaces.

Special qualifications and selection of firms will be place emphasis on design capabilities of firms with previous medical institution dental and surgical operating room design.  Applicants must be able to demonstrate the credentials of the firm and assigned staff to support the design scope.   Selection factors used in the evaluation of A/E submittals for the subject design are from highest to lowest:

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Central Iowa Health Care System in Des Moines, Iowa, Medical Center intends to solicit proposals from contractors in the Des Moines, Iowa metropolitan area to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The VA anticipates issuing a solicitation for this requirement on or about July 23, 2010, with a closing date for proposals on or about August 31, 2010.  The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.

The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.

The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services to meet the needs of those Veterans. Through the HCHV program, VA provides case management services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services.

The Contractor will be required to provide therapeutic and rehabilitative services, but will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment - those services will be provided by the VA at VA facilities.  Due to the urgent nature of this requirement, contractors will be required to demonstrate their ability to provide services within a 2-week period after contract award.  Initial contract awards are expected to be on or about September 15, 2010.  Contracts will have a base term of one year, with options for four additional one-year terms exercisable in the discretion of the VA.   

The government will use a best value source selection method under Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and anticipates making multiple awards of fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts for this requirement.

NAICS Code is 624229 and the solicitation will be issued for full and open competition. All responsible sources may submit proposals which shall be considered by the Agency.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration data base at www.ccr.gov.  Registration is free and potential offerors are encouraged to visit that CCR website and register as soon as possible to avoid delays should they be selected for a contract award. Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist using the e-mail link provided.

Any change in receiver specifications would also result in a loss of interoperability with existing platform integrations and substantial costs associated with fielding multiple receivers (integration, training, spares, sustainment, etc.). Finally, the Government needs uninterrupted MAGR 2000 support starting at contract award. However, the final acquisition approach for the aforementioned follow-on contract is dependent on the results of this Sources Sought. The period of performance of the new contract is estimated to be from January 2012 to 30 Sep 2016. It is also anticipated that program responsibility will have transferred to Warner Robins Air Logistics Center by or shortly after award of the new contract.
<p>The effort to be extended on contract FA8807-05-D-0001 is as follows: (1) hardware procurement of MAGR 2000 S-24s, (2) hardware procurement of MAGR mounts (isolated and un-isolated), (3) hardware upgrade of MAGR 2000 and MAGR 2000S configurations to the MAGR 2000-S24, (4) Quick Reaction Support (QRS) (5) Program Management, (6) Engineering Analysis support CLINs, (7) MAGR 2000 (all configurations) repair, (8) Engineering Change Proposal capability and (9) Contract Data Requirement Line (CDRL) Items. The contract extension will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP) for all CLINs with the exception of Quick Reaction Support (QRS). QRS CLINs will be Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF). The Government anticipates the ordering period of the contract extension to run through December 2011 with production deliveries NLT five months after contract award through 30 September 2012.</p>
<p>The anticipated follow-on Indefinite Quantity Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) production contract will provide for: (1) hardware procurement of MAGR 2000-S24, (2) hardware procurement of MAGR 2000 Mounts (isolated and un-isolated), (3) hardware upgrade of earlier configurations to MAGR 2000-S24 and (4) repair of MAGR 2000s, MAGR 2000-S, and MAGR 2000-S24, (5) QRS, (6) Technical Services, (7) Precise Positioning Service (PPS) Certification (MSO C-145) of MAGR 2000-S24, (8) transition to organic hardware depot to include Government purpose rights in technical data for repairs, (9) transition to organic software support to include Government purpose rights in computer software (source code) and computer software documentation for support, (10) Engineering Change Proposal capability and (11) CDRL Items. All CLINs will be FFP with the exception of QRS and Technical Services. These CLINs will be CPFF. There will not be a separate Program Management CLIN.</p>
<p>Estimated Quantities</p>
<p>MAGR 2000-S24: 508<br />Mounts: 120<br />Production Upgrades: 266<br />Repairs: 808<br />Quick Reaction Support (Hrs): 2000<br />Technical Services (Hrs): 2800</p>
<p>There will be NO funded development effort associated with the extension of the current contract and anticipated award of a new production contract. Receivers shall meet the requirements of CI-MAGR-600 and CI-GRAM-600.</p>
<p>This acquisition will contain classified material. The production contract will contain a Contract Security Classification Specification (DD254).

<a href="mailto:chad.kuipers@us.army.mil">AMCOM Contracting Center - Air (AMCOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The U.S. Army Apache Attack Helicopter Project Office is seeking sources with innovative approaches, designs, or products for new replacement drive actuators on the AH-64D Apache helicopter's FLIR sensor payload.  The AH-64 is the U.S. Army's primary attack helicopter and is designed to fight during the day, night, and in adverse weather.  The U.S. Army is continually upgrading the AH-64 to improve performance, reduce the logistical burden, shrink operations and sustainment costs, eliminate obsolescence issues, and improve reliability over the current systems.  A new set (2 per aircraft - one azimuth, one elevation) of FLIR sensor payload drive actuators are envisioned with enhanced capabilities to assist the AH-64 in effectively operating in current and emerging theaters of operation.<BR>REQUIREMENTS:  Already proven packages are preferred with environmentally sealed structures and highly durable cables, interconnections and fasteners. The design/concept must be able to endure in a high vibration environment, meet Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) including Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) requirements and not interfere with aircraft safety or other existing sub-systems.  Specific technical areas of interest include:<BR><BR>1.	Anticipated operating interfaces and ranges are:<BR> 	2-phase 400Hz 115VAC and/or 28VDC excitation.<BR> 	Speeds in the range of 0-400 RPM on a 0.83 inch wide output pinion.<BR> 	Output signals for resolving pinion position and speed.<BR>2.	The actuators must be durable and reliable in a field maintenance environment, exposed to helicopter flight regimes and in all weather conditions. <BR>3.	The design must maximize output torque per unit input electrical power. The desired actuator output power at 100% duty cycle is at least 230 watts.<BR>4.	The design must minimize actuator volume. Desired maximum length is 5 inches plus a 0.55 inch long output pinion. <BR>5.	The actuator design must include a dynamic brake that will engage when de-energized. The brake design must accommodate regular back-driven operation in the engaged state without reduction in useful life. Desired braking torque is approximately 30 lb-in. <BR>6.	The actuator design (including brake) must maximize reliability performance, with a minimum of 25,000 hours MTBF. The only failure mode considered non-chargeable for this purpose shall be normal drive pinion wear. <BR><BR>The U.S. Army seeks qualified vendors to provide conceptual papers, design information, technology availability, maturity, identification of risks, product descriptions, support requirements, and reliability data addressing all or any part of the requirements or discussion points detailed above.  Innovative ideas and solutions are strongly encouraged.  Interested vendors are encouraged to provide substantiating evidence of their capabilities and successes in the areas cited above.  <BR><BR>All interested qualified sources are encouraged to submit written notification of their interest, qualifications, and technical concepts to the Contracting Officer, Deborah Hughes, (256) 313-4097, e-mail address is Deborah.hughes1@us.army.mil.  The submission of this information is for planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure any items, nor does the U.S. Army intend to award on the basis of this request for sources sought or otherwise pay for the information solicited. <BR>

<a href="mailto:oksana.joye@us.army.mil">AMCOM Contracting Center - Missile (AMCOM-CC)</a>
<DESC><BR>It is recognized that industry and other United States Government (USG) agencies could possess information relevant to development of the Indirect Fire Protection Capability, Increment 2, Intercept (IFPC Inc2-I) system concept and/or critical technologies that are not currently available to the Cruise Missile Defense System (CMDS) Project Office.  For this reason, and in order to create an open environment for future competitions that may be associated with any IFPC Inc2-I Program, the CMDS Project Office is providing this Request for Information (RFI). The primary purpose of the IFPC Inc2-I program is to enhance counter measures for rockets, artillery and mortar (RAM) threats.  Contact POC: All questions or requests regarding this notice may be addressed to Oksana Joye, Contract Specialist, via e-mail oksana.joye@us.army.mil or sent: ATTN: Oksana Joye, Department of the Army, US Army Contracting Command, AMCOM Contracting Cent, CCAM-SM-T, Building 5303, Martin Road, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898. No telephone requests will be accepted.<BR><BR>This is a pre-solicitation RFI issued pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.2.  The CMDS Project Office is conducting a market survey of concepts that can provide enhanced protection for fixed and semi-fixed positions against RAM threats.  No award is intended as a result of this request.  The USG will not pay for information received.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the USG to form a binding contract.  The CMDS Project Office is interested in receiving suggestive information on IFPC Inc2-I concepts that can be quickly implemented and fielded at a reasonable cost that use open architecture constructs to enable integration with existing force and future Command and Control (C2) capabilities.   Either a total system concept or information on key components is being sought.  Within this RFI, a firing system is envisioned to include all the components necessary to execute the engagement of a RAM threat given receipt of an external C2 cue and authority to engage.  <BR><BR>The Accelerated IFPC Inc2-I System Requirements:  Concepts proposed are expected to contain the attributes described below.  All materiel solutions will be considered except conventional gun/armament based solutions since the USG has already completed exhaustive reviews of these concepts.   Utilization of existing capabilities and/or modifications of current fielded army or DoD systems to meet the IFPC Inc2-I requirements is strongly encouraged.  Regardless of concept, the key system attributes for IFPC Inc2-I are: responsiveness to threat systems and the ability to defeat the threat systems.  The threat timeline forces a response time of about 13 seconds, which includes the time from external sensor detection to interceptor engagement (mission kill).  The IFPC Inc2-I system will be able to receive a cue from sensors currently deployed with Brigade Combat Teams and have the ability to seamlessly integrate into an Air and Missile Defense (AMD) C2 architecture when required.  USG analysis of lethality/kinetic energy requirements to defeat likely threat systems is available to respondents upon request within the limitations of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Arms Export Control Act restrictions.  Prior to identifying how each component is broken down, a discussion on the system's overall operational concept should be provided.  The operational concept should begin with the fire control given a radar track/sensor cue, direction to engage and follow the required sequence of events for a mission kill.  The ability to provide additional insights that describe the maturity and demonstrated performance of each component are desired as this will be helpful to better understand the likelihood of availability the proposed concepts for relatively near term use.  Potential candidate materiel solutions include, but should not be limited to:<BR><BR>Missile Interceptor Concepts:  These concepts should address the specifics of each component: launcher, interceptor, fire control sensor and control system.  Specifics on each component are identified in the component attributes below.  In describing the concept, details on specific maturity of each component and any technological aspects which require maturing should be highlighted.  USG missile interceptor design information is available to respondents upon request within limitations of the ITAR and Arms Export Control Act restrictions.  Of particular interest is any concept that is able to effectively utilize existing Army/DoD sensors such as the Sentinel radar to control the interceptor accurately enough to defeat the incoming threat.<BR><BR>Directed Energy Concepts:  Directed energy concepts may include lasers, particle beam, microwave, millimeter wave, radio frequency, acoustic and electromagnetic launch concepts.  These concepts should address the specifics of each component: fire unit, control system, thermal control subsystem and power subsystem.  In addition, the proposed tactical packaging of each system and intended effects should be described in detail.  Definition of the specific technical maturity and/or prior use of each component should be included.  Respondents are requested to include the predicted environment and weather related limitations for any directed energy concepts.<BR><BR>Other Innovative Concepts:  Should there be non-missile/directed energy or an integrated directed energy/missile solution proposed, a complete description of the system concept along with the technical maturity of the individual system components should be provided.  Specifics on how this concept would be demonstrated and effects validated shall be included.<BR><BR>Performance requirements:  The preliminary key objectives for the IFPC Inc2-I performance envelope are described below.  To some extent, performance can be traded for significant cost and schedule advantages.<BR> 	Probability to detonate/deflagrate RAM threats of with a confidence level greater than 90% (single shot is preferred).<BR> 	An IFPC Inc2-I system shall be able to protect a defended area of 16km2 against all RAM threats:<BR> 	Demonstrate the ability to be supported by existing operational battle management architectures;<BR> 	A firing system shall be able to engage 3-8 simultaneous threats arriving from different threat axis;<BR> 	Firing systems, either individually or coupled, shall provide 3600 coverage of inbound threats;<BR> 	The firing system shall be able to engage a minimum of 30 threats without requiring a reload;<BR> 	Minimize collateral damage; the likely minimum engagement range for firing systems is expected to be ~2.5kilometers, however, this will be situationally dependent.<BR> 	The IFPC Inc2-I system shall be able to transition from road-march configuration to emplacement in less than thirty minutes in a modular configuration.<BR> 	The RAM threat is identified in Annex 1.  Additional RAM threat information is available upon request for companies eligible to receive and store SECRET level information.  <BR><BR>Cost and Schedule Estimates:  As part of this response, a detailed schedule and a cost breakout is requested in constant FY 2011 dollars.  This will enable reviewers to help determine concept viability in terms of affordability.  The cost data should be provided in accordance with level three work breakdown structure detail as defined in MIL-HDBK-881A (however, other presentation formats are acceptable).  Additionally, the anticipated cost for the theoretical first unit (T1) of each major component should be provided.  Relevant assumptions to include the learning curve used to achieve this average unit manufacturing cost should be provided.  Man-month loading should be broken out by acquisition phase then by component then by functional area.  The USG is interested in proposed system concepts to include working prototypes (if available) that demonstrate affordability, technology maturity and the system's ability to meet desired programmatic constraints.  Hardware, software, and model & simulation demonstrations along with testing data that are available should support concept performance estimates presented in responses.  Respondents are requested to provide a cost and schedule estimate for full scale demonstrations of the approach using prototype(s) of the proposed system.  It is the Government's desire that production of 50-100 stand-alone IFPC Inc2-I systems be completed within 3 years of a successful Full-Rate Production (FRP) decision.  <BR><BR>Key assessment criteria include: <BR> 	Expected performance<BR> 	Cost and schedule<BR> 	System complexity and ability to integrate within existing battle command architectures<BR> 	Technical maturity and developmental risk of the integrated concept and elements <BR> 	Extent to which existing capabilities and hardware are utilized. <BR><BR>Contracting Strategy:  As part of the accelerated acquisition process and in concert with the guidance within the Weapon System Reform Act, it is the intent of the CMDS Project Office to execute the IFPC Inc2-I development program with a competitive Technology Development (TD)/prototyping phase, followed by Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase, followed by a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract vehicle.  The TD Phase is anticipated to be at least 2 competitively awarded cost-type contracts where awardees will be incentivized to meet schedule goals with specific performance milestones.  The EMD and LRIP Phases are anticipated to be options included in the proposals for the initial TD phase.  FRP will be a separate fixed-price contract.<BR><BR>Component Attributes:  The key goals for IFPC Inc2-I is affordability and timely delivery of the system to the Warfighter.  The following are key attributes that should be described for each component.  <BR><BR>Technical Fire Control: The Technical Fire Control (TFC) system ties the other major end items for IFPC Inc2-I together into an integrated system.  The TFC connects the IFPC Inc2-I firing system with external C2 and surveillance sensors.  It provides personnel manning the IFPC Inc2-I system with a method to interact with the system (man-machine interface).   Proposed concepts have the flexibility to allocate engagement sequence functions to the TFC, the fire direction subsystem or interceptor components.  However, all functions in the engagement, system control and maintenance should be clearly identified and allocated to specific components.  Responder assumptions on amount of new software development, amount and details on utilization of existing software are requested.<BR><BR>Fire Control Sensor: The sensor component will have the required capability to support end-to-end engagements of the entire RAM threat set.  The sensor will use a cue to acquire a specific threat from the TFC, provide precise target tracking in support threat acquisition and assess mission success.  While there may be an inherent surveillance capability provided by the sensor, the primary mission and specific requirements are to be focused on detecting, tracking and providing required support for a successful engagement.<BR><BR>Interceptor (Kinetic or Directed Energy):  The proposed intercept design shall identify key components and their associated cost.  Concepts shall identify the pedigree of each component and describe any use in previous systems.  The proposed intercept concept will be demonstrated in its final tactical configuration prior to Milestone B.  <BR><BR>Launcher:  The launcher shall provide the means to house, protect and launch the number of interceptors needed to meet the number of engagements prior to reload.  If a new launcher, assumptions on its functions, weight, power and transportability shall be stated.  A specific timeline to demonstrate how the launcher is to be integrated into the IFPC Inc2-I demonstration prior to the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) should be provided.  <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>ANNEX<BR>-	UNCLAS Indirect Fire and the Operational Environment<BR><BR>Documentation available upon request (IAW limitations of ITAR and Arms Export Control Act restrictions)<BR>-	IFPC CONOP<BR>-	SECRET Threat appendix<BR>-	USG interceptor and sensor design approach<BR>-	USG kinetic energy analysis for defeat of threat systems<BR><BR><BR> <BR>RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS <BR>The system concept, technological ideas and programmatic structures provided by respondents will be used to augment and refine the planned Government solicitation for the IFPC Inc2-I system.

<DESC><BR>It is recognized that industry and other United States Government (USG) agencies could possess information relevant to development of the Indirect Fire Protection Capability, Increment 2, Intercept (IFPC Inc2-I) system concept and/or critical technologies that are not currently available to the Cruise Missile Defense System (CMDS) Project Office.  For this reason, and in order to create an open environment for future competitions that may be associated with any IFPC Inc2-I Program, the CMDS Project Office is providing this Request for Information (RFI). The primary purpose of the IFPC Inc2-I program is to enhance counter measures for rockets, artillery and mortar (RAM) threats.  Contact POC: All questions or requests regarding this notice may be addressed to Oksana Joye, Contract Specialist, via e-mail oksana.joye@us.army.mil or sent: ATTN: Oksana Joye, Department of the Army, US Army Contracting Command, AMCOM Contracting Cent, CCAM-SM-T, Building 5303, Martin Road, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898. No telephone requests will be accepted.<BR><BR>This is a pre-solicitation RFI issued pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.2.  The CMDS Project Office is conducting a market survey of concepts that can provide enhanced protection for fixed and semi-fixed positions against RAM threats.  No award is intended as a result of this request.  The USG will not pay for information received.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the USG to form a binding contract.  The CMDS Project Office is interested in receiving suggestive information on IFPC Inc2-I concepts that can be quickly implemented and fielded at a reasonable cost that use open architecture constructs to enable integration with existing force and future Command and Control (C2) capabilities.   Either a total system concept or information on key components is being sought.  Within this RFI, a firing system is envisioned to include all the components necessary to execute the engagement of a RAM threat given receipt of an external C2 cue and authority to engage.  <BR><BR>The Accelerated IFPC Inc2-I System Requirements:  Concepts proposed are expected to contain the attributes described below.  All materiel solutions will be considered except conventional gun/armament based solutions since the USG has already completed exhaustive reviews of these concepts.   Utilization of existing capabilities and/or modifications of current fielded army or DoD systems to meet the IFPC Inc2-I requirements is strongly encouraged.  Regardless of concept, the key system attributes for IFPC Inc2-I are: responsiveness to threat systems and the ability to defeat the threat systems.  The threat timeline forces a response time of about 13 seconds, which includes the time from external sensor detection to interceptor engagement (mission kill).  The IFPC Inc2-I system will be able to receive a cue from sensors currently deployed with Brigade Combat Teams and have the ability to seamlessly integrate into an Air and Missile Defense (AMD) C2 architecture when required.  USG analysis of lethality/kinetic energy requirements to defeat likely threat systems is available to respondents upon request within the limitations of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Arms Export Control Act restrictions.  Prior to identifying how each component is broken down, a discussion on the system's overall operational concept should be provided.  The operational concept should begin with the fire control given a radar track/sensor cue, direction to engage and follow the required sequence of events for a mission kill.  The ability to provide additional insights that describe the maturity and demonstrated performance of each component are desired as this will be helpful to better understand the likelihood of availability the proposed concepts for relatively near term use.  Potential candidate materiel solutions include, but should not be limited to:<BR><BR>Missile Interceptor Concepts:  These concepts should address the specifics of each component: launcher, interceptor, fire control sensor and control system.  Specifics on each component are identified in the component attributes below.  In describing the concept, details on specific maturity of each component and any technological aspects which require maturing should be highlighted.  USG missile interceptor design information is available to respondents upon request within limitations of the ITAR and Arms Export Control Act restrictions.  Of particular interest is any concept that is able to effectively utilize existing Army/DoD sensors such as the Sentinel radar to control the interceptor accurately enough to defeat the incoming threat.<BR><BR>Directed Energy Concepts:  Directed energy concepts may include lasers, particle beam, microwave, millimeter wave, radio frequency, acoustic and electromagnetic launch concepts.  These concepts should address the specifics of each component: fire unit, control system, thermal control subsystem and power subsystem.  In addition, the proposed tactical packaging of each system and intended effects should be described in detail.  Definition of the specific technical maturity and/or prior use of each component should be included.  Respondents are requested to include the predicted environment and weather related limitations for any directed energy concepts.<BR><BR>Other Innovative Concepts:  Should there be non-missile/directed energy or an integrated directed energy/missile solution proposed, a complete description of the system concept along with the technical maturity of the individual system components should be provided.  Specifics on how this concept would be demonstrated and effects validated shall be included.<BR><BR>Performance requirements:  The preliminary key objectives for the IFPC Inc2-I performance envelope are described below.  To some extent, performance can be traded for significant cost and schedule advantages.<BR> 	Probability to detonate/deflagrate RAM threats of with a confidence level greater than 90% (single shot is preferred).<BR> 	An IFPC Inc2-I system shall be able to protect a defended area of 16km2 against all RAM threats:<BR> 	Demonstrate the ability to be supported by existing operational battle management architectures;<BR> 	A firing system shall be able to engage 3-8 simultaneous threats arriving from different threat axis;<BR> 	Firing systems, either individually or coupled, shall provide 3600 coverage of inbound threats;<BR> 	The firing system shall be able to engage a minimum of 30 threats without requiring a reload;<BR> 	Minimize collateral damage; the likely minimum engagement range for firing systems is expected to be ~2.5kilometers, however, this will be situationally dependent.<BR> 	The IFPC Inc2-I system shall be able to transition from road-march configuration to emplacement in less than thirty minutes in a modular configuration.<BR> 	The RAM threat is identified in Annex 1.  Additional RAM threat information is available upon request for companies eligible to receive and store SECRET level information.  <BR><BR>Cost and Schedule Estimates:  As part of this response, a detailed schedule and a cost breakout is requested in constant FY 2011 dollars.  This will enable reviewers to help determine concept viability in terms of affordability.  The cost data should be provided in accordance with level three work breakdown structure detail as defined in MIL-HDBK-881A (however, other presentation formats are acceptable).  Additionally, the anticipated cost for the theoretical first unit (T1) of each major component should be provided.  Relevant assumptions to include the learning curve used to achieve this average unit manufacturing cost should be provided.  Man-month loading should be broken out by acquisition phase then by component then by functional area.  The USG is interested in proposed system concepts to include working prototypes (if available) that demonstrate affordability, technology maturity and the system's ability to meet desired programmatic constraints.  Hardware, software, and model & simulation demonstrations along with testing data that are available should support concept performance estimates presented in responses.  Respondents are requested to provide a cost and schedule estimate for full scale demonstrations of the approach using prototype(s) of the proposed system.  It is the Government's desire that production of 50-100 stand-alone IFPC Inc2-I systems be completed within 3 years of a successful Full-Rate Production (FRP) decision.  <BR><BR>Key assessment criteria include: <BR> 	Expected performance<BR> 	Cost and schedule<BR> 	System complexity and ability to integrate within existing battle command architectures<BR> 	Technical maturity and developmental risk of the integrated concept and elements <BR> 	Extent to which existing capabilities and hardware are utilized. <BR><BR>Contracting Strategy:  As part of the accelerated acquisition process and in concert with the guidance within the Weapon System Reform Act, it is the intent of the CMDS Project Office to execute the IFPC Inc2-I development program with a competitive Technology Development (TD)/prototyping phase, followed by Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase, followed by a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract vehicle.  The TD Phase is anticipated to be at least 2 competitively awarded cost-type contracts where awardees will be incentivized to meet schedule goals with specific performance milestones.  The EMD and LRIP Phases are anticipated to be options included in the proposals for the initial TD phase.  FRP will be a separate fixed-price contract.<BR><BR>Component Attributes:  The key goals for IFPC Inc2-I is affordability and timely delivery of the system to the Warfighter.  The following are key attributes that should be described for each component.  <BR><BR>Technical Fire Control: The Technical Fire Control (TFC) system ties the other major end items for IFPC Inc2-I together into an integrated system.  The TFC connects the IFPC Inc2-I firing system with external C2 and surveillance sensors.  It provides personnel manning the IFPC Inc2-I system with a method to interact with the system (man-machine interface).   Proposed concepts have the flexibility to allocate engagement sequence functions to the TFC, the fire direction subsystem or interceptor components.

It is the Government's desire that production of 50-100 stand-alone IFPC Inc2-I systems be completed within 3 years of a successful Full-Rate Production (FRP) decision.  <BR><BR>Key assessment criteria include: <BR> 	Expected performance<BR> 	Cost and schedule<BR> 	System complexity and ability to integrate within existing battle command architectures<BR> 	Technical maturity and developmental risk of the integrated concept and elements <BR> 	Extent to which existing capabilities and hardware are utilized. <BR><BR>Contracting Strategy:  As part of the accelerated acquisition process and in concert with the guidance within the Weapon System Reform Act, it is the intent of the CMDS Project Office to execute the IFPC Inc2-I development program with a competitive Technology Development (TD)/prototyping phase, followed by Engineering, Manufacturing, and Development (EMD) phase, followed by a Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract vehicle.  The TD Phase is anticipated to be at least 2 competitively awarded cost-type contracts where awardees will be incentivized to meet schedule goals with specific performance milestones.  The EMD and LRIP Phases are anticipated to be options included in the proposals for the initial TD phase.  FRP will be a separate fixed-price contract.<BR><BR>Component Attributes:  The key goals for IFPC Inc2-I is affordability and timely delivery of the system to the Warfighter.  The following are key attributes that should be described for each component.  <BR><BR>Technical Fire Control: The Technical Fire Control (TFC) system ties the other major end items for IFPC Inc2-I together into an integrated system.  The TFC connects the IFPC Inc2-I firing system with external C2 and surveillance sensors.  It provides personnel manning the IFPC Inc2-I system with a method to interact with the system (man-machine interface).   Proposed concepts have the flexibility to allocate engagement sequence functions to the TFC, the fire direction subsystem or interceptor components.  However, all functions in the engagement, system control and maintenance should be clearly identified and allocated to specific components.  Responder assumptions on amount of new software development, amount and details on utilization of existing software are requested.<BR><BR>Fire Control Sensor: The sensor component will have the required capability to support end-to-end engagements of the entire RAM threat set.  The sensor will use a cue to acquire a specific threat from the TFC, provide precise target tracking in support threat acquisition and assess mission success.  While there may be an inherent surveillance capability provided by the sensor, the primary mission and specific requirements are to be focused on detecting, tracking and providing required support for a successful engagement.<BR><BR>Interceptor (Kinetic or Directed Energy):  The proposed intercept design shall identify key components and their associated cost.  Concepts shall identify the pedigree of each component and describe any use in previous systems.  The proposed intercept concept will be demonstrated in its final tactical configuration prior to Milestone B.  <BR><BR>Launcher:  The launcher shall provide the means to house, protect and launch the number of interceptors needed to meet the number of engagements prior to reload.  If a new launcher, assumptions on its functions, weight, power and transportability shall be stated.  A specific timeline to demonstrate how the launcher is to be integrated into the IFPC Inc2-I demonstration prior to the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) should be provided.  <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>ANNEX<BR>-	UNCLAS Indirect Fire and the Operational Environment<BR><BR>Documentation available upon request (IAW limitations of ITAR and Arms Export Control Act restrictions)<BR>-	IFPC CONOP<BR>-	SECRET Threat appendix<BR>-	USG interceptor and sensor design approach<BR>-	USG kinetic energy analysis for defeat of threat systems<BR><BR><BR> <BR>RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS <BR>The system concept, technological ideas and programmatic structures provided by respondents will be used to augment and refine the planned Government solicitation for the IFPC Inc2-I system.

<DESC>It is recognized that industry and other United States Government (USG) agencies could possess information relevant to development of the Indirect Fire Protection Capability, Increment 2, Intercept (IFPC Inc2-I) system concept and/or critical technologies that are not currently available to the Cruise Missile Defense System (CMDS) Project Office.  For this reason, and in order to create an open environment for future competitions that may be associated with any IFPC Inc2-I Program, the CMDS Project Office is providing this Request for Information (RFI). The primary purpose of the IFPC Inc2-I program is to enhance counter measures for rockets, artillery and mortar (RAM) threats.  Contact POC: All questions or requests regarding this notice may be addressed to Oksana Joye, Contract Specialist, via e-mail oksana.joye@us.army.mil or sent: ATTN: Oksana Joye, Department of the Army, US Army Contracting Command, AMCOM Contracting Cent, CCAM-SM-T, Building 5303, Martin Road, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898. No telephone requests will be accepted.<BR><BR>This is a pre-solicitation RFI issued pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.2.  The CMDS Project Office is conducting a market survey of concepts that can provide enhanced protection for fixed and semi-fixed positions against RAM threats.  No award is intended as a result of this request.  The USG will not pay for information received.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the USG to form a binding contract.  The CMDS Project Office is interested in receiving suggestive information on IFPC Inc2-I concepts that can be quickly implemented and fielded at a reasonable cost that use open architecture constructs to enable integration with existing force and future Command and Control (C2) capabilities.   Either a total system concept or information on key components is being sought.  Within this RFI, a firing system is envisioned to include all the components necessary to execute the engagement of a RAM threat given receipt of an external C2 cue and authority to engage.  <BR><BR>The Accelerated IFPC Inc2-I System Requirements:  Concepts proposed are expected to contain the attributes described below.  All materiel solutions will be considered except conventional gun/armament based solutions since the USG has already completed exhaustive reviews of these concepts.   Utilization of existing capabilities and/or modifications of current fielded army or DoD systems to meet the IFPC Inc2-I requirements is strongly encouraged.  Regardless of concept, the key system attributes for IFPC Inc2-I are: responsiveness to threat systems and the ability to defeat the threat systems.  The threat timeline forces a response time of about 13 seconds, which includes the time from external sensor detection to interceptor engagement (mission kill).  The IFPC Inc2-I system will be able to receive a cue from sensors currently deployed with Brigade Combat Teams and have the ability to seamlessly integrate into an Air and Missile Defense (AMD) C2 architecture when required.  USG analysis of lethality/kinetic energy requirements to defeat likely threat systems is available to respondents upon request within the limitations of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Arms Export Control Act restrictions.  Prior to identifying how each component is broken down, a discussion on the system's overall operational concept should be provided.  The operational concept should begin with the fire control given a radar track/sensor cue, direction to engage and follow the required sequence of events for a mission kill.  The ability to provide additional insights that describe the maturity and demonstrated performance of each component are desired as this will be helpful to better understand the likelihood of availability the proposed concepts for relatively near term use.  Potential candidate materiel solutions include, but should not be limited to:<BR><BR>Missile Interceptor Concepts:  These concepts should address the specifics of each component: launcher, interceptor, fire control sensor and control system.  Specifics on each component are identified in the component attributes below.  In describing the concept, details on specific maturity of each component and any technological aspects which require maturing should be highlighted.  USG missile interceptor design information is available to respondents upon request within limitations of the ITAR and Arms Export Control Act restrictions.  Of particular interest is any concept that is able to effectively utilize existing Army/DoD sensors such as the Sentinel radar to control the interceptor accurately enough to defeat the incoming threat.<BR><BR>Directed Energy Concepts:  Directed energy concepts may include lasers, particle beam, microwave, millimeter wave, radio frequency, acoustic and electromagnetic launch concepts.  These concepts should address the specifics of each component: fire unit, control system, thermal control subsystem and power subsystem.  In addition, the proposed tactical packaging of each system and intended effects should be described in detail.  Definition of the specific technical maturity and/or prior use of each component should be included.  Respondents are requested to include the predicted environment and weather related limitations for any directed energy concepts.<BR><BR>Other Innovative Concepts:  Should there be non-missile/directed energy or an integrated directed energy/missile solution proposed, a complete description of the system concept along with the technical maturity of the individual system components should be provided.  Specifics on how this concept would be demonstrated and effects validated shall be included.<BR><BR>Performance requirements:  The preliminary key objectives for the IFPC Inc2-I performance envelope are described below.  To some extent, performance can be traded for significant cost and schedule advantages.<BR> 	Probability to detonate/deflagrate RAM threats of with a confidence level greater than 90% (single shot is preferred).<BR> 	An IFPC Inc2-I system shall be able to protect a defended area of 16km2 against all RAM threats:<BR> 	Demonstrate the ability to be supported by existing operational battle management architectures;<BR> 	A firing system shall be able to engage 3-8 simultaneous threats arriving from different threat axis;<BR> 	Firing systems, either individually or coupled, shall provide 3600 coverage of inbound threats;<BR> 	The firing system shall be able to engage a minimum of 30 threats without requiring a reload;<BR> 	Minimize collateral damage; the likely minimum engagement range for firing systems is expected to be ~2.5kilometers, however, this will be situationally dependent.<BR> 	The IFPC Inc2-I system shall be able to transition from road-march configuration to emplacement in less than thirty minutes in a modular configuration.<BR> 	The RAM threat is identified in Annex 1.  Additional RAM threat information is available upon request for companies eligible to receive and store SECRET level information.  <BR><BR>Cost and Schedule Estimates:  As part of this response, a detailed schedule and a cost breakout is requested in constant FY 2011 dollars.  This will enable reviewers to help determine concept viability in terms of affordability.  The cost data should be provided in accordance with level three work breakdown structure detail as defined in MIL-HDBK-881A (however, other presentation formats are acceptable).  Additionally, the anticipated cost for the theoretical first unit (T1) of each major component should be provided.  Relevant assumptions to include the learning curve used to achieve this average unit manufacturing cost should be provided.  Man-month loading should be broken out by acquisition phase then by component then by functional area.  The USG is interested in proposed system concepts to include working prototypes (if available) that demonstrate affordability, technology maturity and the system's ability to meet desired programmatic constraints.  Hardware, software, and model & simulation demonstrations along with testing data that are available should support concept performance estimates presented in responses.  Respondents are requested to provide a cost and schedule estimate for full scale demonstrations of the approach using prototype(s) of the proposed system.

<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals for conduct of 6.3 Research & Development as described below.  Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  This Broad Agency Announcement constitutes the total solicitation.  There will be no formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or other solicitation requests for this requirement other than this announcement. <BR><BR>INTRODUCTION:<BR><BR>The intent of the Future Affordable Turbine Engine (FATE) program is to take advantage of recent component efforts under DoD/NASA/DOE Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) program and other recent advanced technology efforts to advance the state-of-the-art of turbine engines. Accordingly, the objective of this announcement is the development of a 5,000 to 10,000 shaft horsepower engine to demonstrate advanced gas turbine technology capable of meeting / exceeding program goals and requirements, while providing good reliability, maintainability, durability, operability, ballistic tolerance, and producibility characteristics, for potential application to multiple military and commercial vehicles.  Moreover, the FATE program will provide a validated engine technology base from which future Army rotorcraft engine engineering,  manufacturing, and development efforts may evolve at minimum risk, time, and development cost. <BR><BR>The overall goals of the FATE program include a 35% reduction in Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC), an 80% improvement in Shaft Horsepower to Weight (shp/wt), a 20% improvement in design life, a 45% reduction in production and maintenance cost, and a 20% reduction in development cost. These goals, defined in detail below, are relative to year 2000 fielded systems. The FATE program will emphasize the development of innovative component technologies and / or cycle configurations to address overall and part power performance.  Improved part-power fuel consumption characteristics are needed to meet the emerging endurance and cruise requirements associated with future Army aviation platforms.   Increased range, endurance, and lift capabilities drive the need for efficient propulsion capability over a wide operating envelope.<BR><BR>The FATE development will also address the need to minimize overall vehicle operation and support costs.  The improved fuel consumption, durability, reliability and maintainability characteristics, and the emphasis on lower production and maintenance costs for the gas turbine engine approach will result in significantly reduced O&S costs.<BR><BR>The FATE program will be an integral part of the DoD/NASA/DOE VAATE program.  Although a Government approved Advanced Turbo Propulsion Plan (ATPP) will eventually be required for any successful offeror(s), such a plan is not required in order to be eligible for an award under this solicitation.  The FATE demonstrator engine program is anticipated for award in the 1st quarter FY12.<BR><BR>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:<BR>The FATE program shall consist of design, fabrication, and component / engine demonstration testing aimed at achieving the program goals (stated in detail below) for the Army's Future Force fleet of rotorcraft. Engine demonstration testing shall include performance and durability testing (note:  slave and / or non-production hardware permitted for engine testing).  The FATE program shall also include an analytical assessment to validate notional engine cost and weight goals. FATE program engine level goals and associated notes /ground rules include:<BR><BR>Program Goals (Curves provided upon request for Goals 1-4; refer to instructions in Section G in Supplemental Package):<BR>1.	Part Power SFC Goal @ 50% IRP, Sea Level, 59F: based on proposed demo Hp size;  (note: IRP Hp is based on IRP T4.5 established at SLS ambient conditions) <BR>2.

2.  Contractor/laboratory shall provide acceptable MDL studies for all parameters.
3. The Contractor/laboratory may not sub contract any analysis out.
4.  In order to receive an award the laboratory must be approved by Mid-Pacific Region's Environmental Office MP-157.  Approval will include but not be limited to passing a Quality Assurance Audit below, receiving an acceptable review of the laboratory's QA Manual, round-robin performance evaluation samples, and reporting limits.
Audit Process:
The MP-157 quality assurance (QA) section conducts audits on laboratories involved in analytical activities that support MP-157 Mid-Pacific Region projects.  The audit consists of reviewing the laboratory's QA manual and the last three years of approved round-robin performance study results, submitting performance evaluation samples, and conducting an onsite audit.  The review process allows the QA section to determine if laboratories are capable of performing quality analyses on Mid-Pacific Region samples while following QA/QC practices that meet or exceed Mid-Pacific Region standards and protocols.
Background Review:
Prior to the audit, the QA section will contact the laboratory QA officer or the laboratory director and request a copy of both the current QA manual and the last three years of approved round-robin performance study results.  The performance study results and QA manual are reviewed by the QA section.
Performance Evaluation Samples:
Prior to the onsite audit, the QA section conducts a performance audit by submitting performance evaluation samples.  The purpose of the performance evaluation samples is to evaluate the laboratory's ability to generate accurate data.  If the laboratory performs poorly on the performance evaluation samples, the QA section may consider not conducting the onsite audit.  The parameters submitted for the performance evaluation samples will be tailored to reflect those of current Mid-Pacific Region projects and the methods the laboratory performs.  
If the laboratory does not obtain a result within the acceptance criteria, the laboratory will be directed to reanalyze the sample(s).  If the reanalyzed result is within the acceptance criteria, then the performance audit is considered acceptable.  If the laboratory still does not meet the acceptance criteria upon reanalysis, a new performance evaluation sample from a different lot or vendor will be submitted.  If the laboratory can obtain an acceptable result on the new performance evaluation sample, the performance audit is considered acceptable.  If the laboratory does not meet the acceptance on the original, reanalysis, or new performance evaluation sample, the laboratory will not be audited or approved for this method/parameter.
Audit Agenda:
Approximately one week prior to the audit, the auditor will send the laboratory contact a proposed audit agenda.  The audit agenda details the time allotted for the initial meeting with management, analytical method review, document review, and debrief.  After laboratory review and approval, the audit agenda will be finalized. Onsite Audit:
An onsite laboratory audit is conducted by the QA section to assess the laboratory's expertise in conducting the analyses, the capability for producing valid data, the ability to effectively support the data, and the integrity of the QA/QC practices. Meet with Management:
The first step of the audit will be to meet with management and key laboratory personnel to discuss the purpose of the audit and give a general overview about the Mid-Pacific Region and the Environmental Monitoring Branch (MP-157).  During this meeting, the audit team will discuss MP-157's policies and requirements, the performance evaluation sample results (if available), document request, and questions for the QA Officer (QAO).   Analytical Method and Document Review:
During the onsite audit, the QA officer, analysts, and other key laboratory personnel are questioned to determine their overall understanding of the methods and laboratory procedures.  Documentation practices are also reviewed.  In general, the auditors are checking to see if the laboratory procedures follow the laboratory's QA manual guidelines and the EPA method, Standard method, or other method protocols.
Debrief:
The most serious deviations are presented to the laboratory as findings in a debrief meeting at the end of the audit; the debrief is generally conducted the day after the audit.  All the deviations are written as findings or observations in the final audit report.  Audit Report:
Any deviations from accepted protocols are written in an audit report as findings.  The report can also include good practices for any procedures that the auditors would like the laboratory to continue and observations for any procedures that the auditors would like the laboratory to adopt.  
Laboratory Audit Response and Final Approval LetterThe laboratory is asked to send a response to each finding detailed in the QA section's audit report.  The auditors will review this response and assess if the corrective actions and explanations are acceptable.  If any response is questionable, the laboratory is contacted for clarification.
Once the review of the laboratory's audit response is complete, the lead auditor will send a final letter addressing whether or not the laboratory is approved for use.
Central Contractor Registration (CCR), as required by FAR 4.1102, applies to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on CCR registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.

DLA Distribution's core function is to provide military and commercial repair parts, clothing and textiles, medical supplies, industrial and electronic components (as well as other functions) to military customers and others throughout the world. DLA Distribution utilizes a sophisticated and detailed enterprise wide Warehouse Management System (WMS) to provide for distribution operations of that part of the supply chain. A key component of the WMS is the use of a secure 802.11g/n wireless connection to a strategically placed DOD mainframe system in the United States. <br />It is the goal of the DLA Information Operations to provide a viable and supportable wireless network among all DLA Distribution sites and locations. The wireless network infrastructure at many of the sites is beyond its estimated useful life and must be upgraded, or in some cases, there may not be an existing wireless network infrastructure.<br />Specific Characteristics of the Solution:<br />The Contractor will be responsible for providing management, personnel, supervision, materials, tools, and equipment in support of the major functional areas. The requirement is for a complete IEEE 802.11g/n (and complete migration strategy to 802.11n) wireless blanket system to be deployed at select DLA distribution sites or to augment the wireless systems currently in place at those sites by adding components or devices to attach to the current system. The major functional areas include:
<p>(a) Survey of identified sites/locations worldwide and development of a detailed design specification for wireless network upgrade/installation, to include equipment and labor required for those sites/locations.<br />(b) Purchase of required components per the approved site survey specification.<br />(c) Upgrade existing or install new hardware and/or software at identified sites/locations worldwide per the approved site survey specification.<br />(d) Provide on-going telephone and/or on-site support to installed locations.</p>
<p>Salient Characteristics:<br />The upgraded wireless network must be compatible with existing hardware, to include handheld terminals (Psion 7535 G2), vehicle mounts (Psion 8525), access points (Psion 9160 G2), controllers (Psion 9500), and gateways (Air Fortress 7500 and Air Fortress FCX 250).<br />FUNCTION DESCRIPTION<br />802.11g/n Handheld terminals 802.11g/n capability, Windows CE \Mobile, RFID capability, Cellular capability, CAC enabled, FIPS 140 Compliant, Long Range Scanning capability, 2D , 3 of 9, 128, code 39, pdf 416 barcode scanning capable<br />Vehicle mounted terminals 802.11g/n capability, Windows CE \Mobile, RFID capability, Cellular capability, CAC enabled, FIPS 140 Compliant, Long Range Scanning capability, 2D , 3 of 9, 128, code 39, pdf 416 barcode scanning capable<br />802.11g/n Access Points 802.11 g/n compliant, FIPS 140 compliant, SNMP <br />3.0, Intrusion Detection/Prevention system, Rogue AP detection, must be POE compatible.<br />VPN client software for handhelds and vehicle mounted terminals WIN CE /Mobile compatible<br />VPN hardware and software WIN CE /Mobile compatible<br />Terminal emulation software 3270 Terminal Emulation compatible.<br />Man portable printers Wireless Handheld printer, thermal laser compatible, barcode printing capable</p>

<DESC><p>The Defense Logistics Agency - Energy (DLA-E) seeks to identify, and obtain information from responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the electrical distribution (NAICS 221122), potable water distribution (NAICS 221310), and wastewater collection systems (NAICS 221320) at Anniston Army Depot, Alabama. Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity. The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. &sect;2688 - Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.<br /><br />Contractor will be required to assume ownership of the electric power distribution, potable water distribution and wastewater collection systems at Anniston AD, AL, and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the systems and provide utility services to the Government. Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility systems.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter "Notice") is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility. Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation. Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming. Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 3:00 pm EST on Tuesday, February 8, 2011. Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address: (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (small, or any sub-category of small business, or other than small). The potential for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.</p>
<p>This Notice is solely for the Government's use as a market research tool. As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed. If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the June - July 2011 timeframe. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice. All information received will be considered. Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.</p>
<p>This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award. The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DLA Energy Contracting Office.</p>
<p>Installation Description<br />Nested in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in northeast Alabama, Anniston Army Depot (ANAD) occupies over 25 square miles of land, encompassing more than 15,246 acres of woodland and 10 acres of lakes and streams. Possibly the nation's most diversified defense resources - ANAD offers scenic splendor as well as unlimited natural resources.<br />From its origin in 1942 as a storage depot, ANAD has transformed into a state-of-the-market maintenance facility, earning its highly-esteemed reputation as "The Tank Rebuild Center of the World." ANAD is the designated Center of Industrial and Technical Excellence (CITE) for combat vehicles (tracked and wheeled), artillery (self propelled and towed), bridging systems, and small caliber weapons (individual and crew served). ANAD performs depot level maintenance on vehicles ranging in size from the Stryker to the 70 ton M1 Abrams Tank and a variety of other types in between, like the M113 Family of Vehicles, the M88 Recovery Vehicle, and the M9 Armored Combat Engineering vehicle. Major components of each vehicle are also overhauled and returned to stock. ANAD personnel are deployed around the world in direct support of our nation's war fighters providing fielding services and repairs in the field. Combat and battle damage repairs are currently being accomplished both at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Under partnership agreements, a wide range of vehicle conversions, upgrades, and new vehicle manufacturing are currently underway. Additionally, worldwide distribution of stocks and the maintenance and storage of conventional ammunition and missiles, as well as the storage of seven percent of the Nation's chemical munitions stockpile (until the stockpile is demilitarized) are significant parts of the depot's overall missions and capabilities. The Department of Defense's only missile recycling center is located at Anniston.<br />Statistics:<br />6,716 Total Employees<br />4,254 Depot Employees<br />$1,151M Operating Budget<br />$680M Average Annual Tennant and Contractor Budget <br />$307M Depot Payroll<br />$1.78B Plant Replacement Value <br />1,770 Buildings/Structures<br />244 Miles of Roadway<br />93 Miles of Fencing<br />42 Miles of Railroad<br />Additional installation information may be located at: http://www.anad.army.mil/</p>

This is a Sources Sought Notice and is for informational/market research purposes only.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTATIONS OR BIDS. <BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, requests capability statements from 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Businesses and HUBZone small businesses concerning the potential project described below. Responses to this Sources Sought announcement will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. <BR><BR>NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.<BR><BR>Responses are to be sent via e-mail to James.A.Mazurick@usace.army.mil or hard copy to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 10 S Howard St, Room-7000P, Baltimore, MD 21201-1715, no later than 3:00 p.m. eastern standard time January 19, 2011.<BR>Project Description: Mowing Services Contract, Tioga-Hammond & Cowanesque Lakes, North Central Pennsylvania and Williamsport, PA.<BR>The solicitation will be for a service contract and will be advertised as an Invitation for Bid (IFB) in the $500,000 - $1,000,000 range.<BR>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District is seeking interested sources for Mowing Services at the Tioga-Hammond & Cowanesque Lakes Project.  The Tioga-Hammond & Cowanesque Lakes Project is located in Tioga County in North Central Pennsylvania, just south of Corning, NY and north of Williamsport, PA.  The project incorporates three lakes (Tioga, Hammond, and Cowanesque) and a levee system (Mansfield).  Mowing services will be required on dams, levees, along roadways, in developed recreation areas, and in other selected areas of the project.  Mowing services are required to ensure proper maintenance of the dams and levee.  Additionally, mowing is required to provide quality recreational opportunities and experiences for the visiting public.  Interested sources should note that all work under this contract will be ordered by issuance of individual mowing calls.  The mowing call will state the type, location and number of acres to be mowed. The contractor will be notified of required mowing services no less than two days prior to the need for such services, via telephone, email, or fax.  All mowing calls must be started by the date shown on the call form and completed within 5 business days of that date.  Any work found to be deficient or anytime the contractor is recalled to conduct mowing services, the contractor must be able to respond no later than 48 hrs from the time of the call to return is received.<BR><BR>The contractor shall provide all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, fuel, vehicles, management, and quality control for mowing services at the Tioga-Hammond & Cowanesque Lakes Project for an estimated 484 acres.  The areas that comprise this acreage estimate have frequency requirements ranging from once every three years to 23 times a year.  The total estimated mowing acres is 3965.  This estimate is the total acreage of the areas multiplied by the number of times they are anticipated to be mowed.  The government is not certain of the number of acres to be mowed, the mowing dates, or the number of times an area will get mowed.  The government will specify an estimated quantity for the contractor to use as a guide and for bidding purposes.  This contract will be for a base and four option years.<BR><BR>Mowing at the dams and levee will require equipment certified to be operated on slopes typically found at these locations.  These slopes are quite steep.   The following models of mowing equipment are specifically designed for mowing steep embankments such as those found on the dams and levee: Power-Trac TSM Model PT-1850, Kut Kwick SuperSlopeMaster SSM38-72D, Hustler Hillsider Model 6400.  The contractor shall use a model substantially equivalent to these models when mowing the steepest sections of the embankments on the dams and levee.  However, the contractor is responsible for selecting the proper equipment and must be able to show that his/her equipment is rated for the slopes being mowed on the embankments of the dams and levee.

<DESC>Synopsis:  <BR><BR>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Strategic Forces Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT) is seeking potential sources interested in and capable of performing Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) for Space Superiority in a classified Top Secret SCI environment.  The primary task is to develop a mobile, ground-based, tactically-centric space information superiority capability to meet joint requirements and validated U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) capability gaps.  The system would maximize Commercial and Government off-the-shelf (COTS and GOTS) hardware and utilize a Modular and Open System Approach to enhance future upgrades to meet emerging/changing space capabilities.  System mobility, using military tactical vehicles, will enable the system to move and maintain space superiority in support of Brigade tactical operations.  The potential development contract may include completion of a preliminary design over an eighteen to twenty-four month period while building two Production Representative Systems that will be used in developmental and operational testing.  The proposed effort may also include options for follow-on low density production (3-15 total systems) completed over an additional eighteen month Production cycle.  Although no formal solicitation exists at this time, USASMDC/ARSTRAT is issuing this RFI to gain awareness of interest, capabilities and qualifications of all companies who could support this requirement as a prime contractor for future acquisition.  All small businesses capable of providing the requirements as outlined in the RFI are invited to respond.<BR>  <BR>Potential offerors will be required to have a current TS SCI facility, as well as personnel with current TS clearance that are SCI approved, for contract performance.  A classified information dissemination meeting/industry day is planned for no earlier than 23 February 2011 at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, AL.  Attendance at the conference is limited to three persons per company (one business management, one technical and one security).  Personnel attending the meeting must have a current TS clearance with SCI eligibility.  As a precursor to the industry day, each interested party must submit the name and phone number of the company's security point of contact to Ms. Amy Aguirre, Contracting Officer, at (256) 955-1254 no later than 31 January 2011.<BR><BR>A best value source selection is anticipated as the method of contractor selection.  Contract type has not yet been determined.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code that adequately describes the majority of the work is 334220 Space Satellites, Communications, Manufacturing with a small business size standard of 750 Employees.  In accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement (DFARS), all potential offerors are reminded that Central Contractor Registration (CCR) is required.  Lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.<BR><BR>No solicitation is being issued at this time.  This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.  Interested parties must respond to this notice to be considered for future solicitations associated with this effort.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Service Area Office East, Network Contracting Activity 8, West Palm Beach, FL intends to solicit on a sole source basis for parts, labor, digital control programming, digital outputs and exhaust fan cycling for 52 existing proprietary Siemens air handler units, as well as all related wiring and construction modification as necessary. This is not a solicitation. This is market research for informational purposes only. Do not submit bids or proposals for this project. The government is seeking any manufacturer or company who is authorized to modify and/or enhance the proprietary Siemens System 600/Apogee System and can provide an "equal" or better product. The project requires the installation of panels, controllers, power supplies and relays to control the minimum OA dampers on 52 AHU's.  In order to prevent rapid closing/slamming of the dampers, restrictors shall be installed to allow dampers to close slowly, minimum of 15 seconds to close. The project also includes point creation within the BAS as well as programming of the system for efficient use. In addition to controlling the outside air dampers, this project also requires the modification of the exhaust air system in the building.  In general, by closing off 159,000 cfm of supply air entering the building, we must also limit exhausting a percentage of that air to maintain a building with a slightly positive pressure.  Therefore, this project also calls for the programming of certain exhaust fans to be cycled off during modified outside air dampers events. A single emergency point shall be created and graphically represented on the main graphic screen and shall shut off all dampers and associated exhaust fans upon with an interacting icon on the graphic's screen.  The OA Damper project is also intended to be used in the future with daytime control CO2 controls. This project will also provide a means to close outside air dampers to the facility when perimeter outdoor environmental concerns are present surrounding the facility.  

Firm shall be capable of completing performance of this project within twelve weeks of receipt of Notice to Proceed.  BAS parts are required for this project and are available on GS Schedules.  Pricing from GSA Schedules are required.  Work shall be performed at the VA Medical Center located at West Palm Beach, Florida, Building #1.

If you are qualified and authorized to provide the specified equipment, parts and labor on the Siemen's System 600/ Apogee System and provide necessary construction to integrate the system with existing systems in the building, submit your authorization and qualifications to Deborah Murphy, Contracting Officer, Department of Veterans Affairs, SAO East, NCA 8, Building 12, 7305 N Military Trail, West Palm Beach, FL  33410. Email submissions are acceptable. Due date for all submissions is January 28, 2011 by 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time. Please send your email submissions to Deborah.Murphy3@va.gov.  If you have any questions, please submit them via email.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) awarded a Purchase Order, via a limited competition basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-2, to Chesapeake Mission Critical, 11900-G Baltimore Avenue, Beltsville, MD 20705, for the installation component of a UPS unit purchased from them on 21 September, 2010 on purchase order SB1341-10-SE-0497 P001. The Purchase Order number SB1341-10-SE-0497 P002 was awarded 16 December 2010 in the amount of $57,025.00.
<p>Limited competition determination was based on the urgency of the procurement and the potential for severe financial harm to the Government (estimated at $32,000/week for an additional shutdown and restart of the Ultra Low Temperature Scanning Tunneling Microscope Apparatus (at least one week, possibly two being required), as well as liquid helium costs of approximately $3,000.00), the Contracting Officer determined that the procurement would be satisfied as Unusual and Compelling Urgency as defined in FAR 6.302-2 (see excerpt from FAR below:</p>
<p>6.302-2 -- Unusual and Compelling Urgency.<br />(a) Authority.<br />(1) Citations: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2).<br />(2) When the agency's need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for.<br />(b) Application. This authority applies in those situations where<br />(1) An unusual and compelling urgency precludes full and open competition, and<br />(2) Delay in award of a contract would result in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government.<br />(c) Limitations.<br />(1) Contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by the written justifications and approvals described in 6.303 and 6.304. These justifications may be made and approved after contract award when preparation and approval prior to award would unreasonably delay the acquisition.<br />(2) This statutory authority requires that agencies shall request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable under the circumstances.</p>
<p>The urgency of the procurement was determined based on the requirement for NIST to replace its failed MGE Comet UPS with the new unit while the redundant back up UPS unit was scheduled for maintenance. If the new unit was not installed during the shutdown already planned for the maintenance, a second shutdown (incurring the costs shown above) would have to be scheduled. In addition, choosing another Contractor other than Chesapeake Mission Critical for the installation would void the CMC's warranty on the UPS unit itself as well the maintenance and service plan that is currently in place. Therefore, the Contracting Officer supported the Unusual and Compelling Urgency determination.</p>

Performance Requirements Summary (PRS).  Our rights and remedies described in this PRS, which is a part of the contract, are in addition to other rights and remedies set forth in the contract.  Specifically, we reserve the contract rights under FAR 52.212-4, (a) Inspection/Acceptance and (m) Termination for cause.  Quality assurance actions and remedies that are applied against deficiencies found during surveillance will be in accordance with the provisions under FAR 52.212-4(a) Inspection/Acceptance.  The purpose of this technical exhibit is to define performance evaluation and payment procedures.  The absence from this PRS of any contract requirement, however, shall not detract from its enforceability or limit our rights or remedies under any other provision of the contract.  The Government's role in the day-to-day administration of this contract is to ensure that requirements of the contract are met IAW the stated standards.  This may require enforcement of the contract when the Contractor fails to correct a deficiency or a defect in service, or take corrective action to prevent a reoccurring problem.  The COR should notify the KO whenever corrective action is needed.  The decision as to the type of the enforcement remedy will be determined at the discretion of the KO.

GOVERNMENT QUALITY ASSURANCE.  Your performance will be compared to the contract standards and AQLs using the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP). <BR><BR>2. 1.  Use of this Plan.  The Government will use this plan and the contract to develop monthly surveillance schedules to administer this contract until termination.  This plan may be modified without the Contractor's approval whenever necessary; e.g., changes in requirements, changes in contractor performance and changes in quality assurance resources.  The source document for this plan is the Performance Requirements Summary.<BR><BR>2.2.  Responsibilities.  The COR is responsible for development, implementation, maintenance and continued use of this plan.  The COR will develop a comprehensive monthly surveillance schedule using the contract PRS, the contractor's approved QC Plan and the schedule.  The Surveillance Schedule for the following month should be developed prior to the last day of the current month and submitted to the KO for information purposes.  Once the schedule has been developed, it must be marked "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" and maintained under Government cover by the COR.<BR><BR>2.3.  Evaluations.  The COR and Quality Assurance Evaluators (QAEs) should be consistent, fair and reasonable when inspecting and evaluating contract performance.  The Government does not expect, nor can afford to pay for, perfect performance.  Whenever a deficiency in service is identified, the COR/QAE must determine if the Government contributed to the cause of the problem.  If any Government action caused or contributed to the Contractor's unacceptable performance, the COR/QAE will appropriately document the inspection and proceed to have the situation/problem corrected within the Government.  The Contractor will not be found at fault in these situations.<BR><BR>2.4.  Surveillance Schedule.  Prior to the end of each month, the COR will develop a comprehensive Surveillance Schedule for use during the following month.  Once the random inspections have been determine and identified on the schedule, than the planned inspections for the infrequent tasks and services can be scheduled.  <BR><BR>2.5.  Sampling Inspections.  Random or planned inspections will be performed for all services list on the PRS.  It is essential that the exact number or required inspections for each listed service on the PRS is performed.  If less than the required number of samples is drawn, than the ability to project from the lot size results is destroyed.<BR><BR>2.6.  Sampling Guides.  The COR will ensure that the Sampling Guides are used to conduct random and planned inspections of services listed on the PRS.  The performance criteria listed in each Sampling Guide will determine if performance is satisfactory or defective.  Any service rated defective, and associated tasks rated deficient, must be fully documented IAW the applicable contract paragraph(s).  All recorded defects in service will count against the allowable number of defects established by ANSI/ASQCZ1.4 referenced above.  The COR will immediately initiate a course of corrective action through the KO anytime the Contractor fails to perform any of the quality control and safety tasks.  Some of these tasks may be Critical Control Points (CCP) identified in the contractor's quality control plan.  These deficiencies may require the initiation of a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR) to enforce the contract and prevent reoccurrence.<BR><BR>2.7.  QA Checklist(s).  The COR will used a QA Checklist to conduct unscheduled, impromptu, and  planned inspections of tasks that are performed less frequently than daily.  All evaluations conducted using the QA Checklist will be rated as satisfactory or unsatisfactory.  All unsatisfactory ratings will be fully documented for appropriate use by the KO to enforce the contract.  An unsatisfactory evaluation on the checklist will constitute a performance <BR>deficiency (defect) and will not count against the AQL.  Deficiencies may also be documented in the form of a memorandum, which cites the specific contract paragraph.  The COR will immediately initiate a course of corrective action through the KO anytime the Contractor fails to perform any of the quality control and safety tasks.  Some of these tasks may be Critical Control Points (CCP) identified in the contractor's quality control plan.  This may require the initiation of a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR).<BR><BR>2.8.  Random Surveillance Record.  The COR will maintain a Random Surveillance Record monthly by facility of all PRS inspections results.  Inspections will be monitored for satisfactory results, defects in service and trends in contract performance.  The total number of recorded defects will be tabulated and compared to the number of allowable defects indicated by the PRS.  Information generated by the Random Surveillance Record will be used to complete the Quality Assurance Summary Report<BR><BR>2.9.  Unscheduled/Impromptu Inspections.  The COR may conduct unscheduled and impromptu inspections whenever the need arises.  These inspections are similar to planned inspections, with the exception that they are not identified on the Surveillance Schedule.  Results of these inspections will serve as further documentation and support for other evaluations that can be used to enforce the contract.<BR><BR>2.10.  PRS Summary Report.  The COR will complete and forward a comprehensive report along with DD Form 250, Acceptance and Receiving Report, to the KO monthly.  This report will indicate the quality of performance as related to the acceptance level for each listed service.  When performance of any service listed on the PRS is defective (the number of defects exceeds the acceptable level) the COR will recommend to the KO a remedy under the "Inspection of Service" clause of this contract.<BR><BR>2.11.  Payment Deductions.  The COR will compute the appropriate deduction for recorded defects IAW sample deduction computations contained in this Technical Exhibit 1.<BR><BR>3. CRITERIA FOR ACCEPTABLE AND UNACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE.  The standards and AQL are based on the levels of performance for the listed service.  The Service will be accepted and paid for at the maximum payment percentage specified in the PRS when the number of defects found by the Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE) during contract surveillance does not exceed the number of defects allowed by the AQL in column 5.  When the number of defects in your performance found by the QAE exceeds the acceptable level, you shall respond to a Contract Discrepancy Report (CDR).  The CDR will require you to explain, in writing, why performance was unacceptable; how performance will be returned to acceptable levels; and how recurrence of the problem will be prevented in the future.  The Contracting Officer will evaluate your explanation and determine if full payment, partial payment, or the contract termination process is applicable.  Your payment for services rendered will be calculated as stated in paragraph 4 of this technical exhibit.<BR><BR>3.1. Determining the number of defects that will cause less than maximum payment.<BR><BR>3.1.1. When the method of surveillance of a service is random sampling, the tables in ANSI/ASQC Z1.4. will be used to determine the number of defects (based on the lot size, sample size, and AQL for each contract requirement) which will result in you receiving less than maximum payment.<BR><BR>3.1.2. When the method of surveillance is other than random sampling, the number of defects that will cause less than a maximum payment will be determined as follows:<BR><BR>3.1.2.1. If the AQL is a constant number of defects (for example, two defects), the AQL plus one or more additional defects will render the performance unsatisfactory and cause less than maximum payment (for example, three defects).<BR><BR>3.1.2.2. If the AQL is a percentage value, it is multiplied by the lot size to determine the number of defects that will allow maximum payment.  If the value results in a decimal of .5 or greater, it will be rounded up, for example, 6.6 would be rounded to 7 defects; if the decimal is less than .5 it will be rounded to the lower whole number, for example, 6.3 would be rounded to 6 defects.  One or more additional defects will render the performance unsatisfactory and cause less than the maximum payment.<BR><BR>3.2. Acceptance of  re-performance or late performance.  Re-performance may not be an option.  Late performance of full service activity may be accepted up to 2 hours.<BR><BR>4. CONTRACTOR PAYMENT.  Each month your performance will be compared to contract standards and AQLs as stated in the contract using our Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan.  Monthly payments to you will be reduced for unsatisfactory performance using the following methods:<BR><BR>4.1. If the performance of a required service exceeds the AQL and the poor performance is your fault, we may not pay the full percentage value of the service stated in column 7 of the PRS.<BR><BR>4.1.1. The payment for services which exceed the AQL will be calculated as follows: <BR><BR>4.1.1.1. For services for which the method of surveillance is sampling, the item listing in the bid schedule accumulated to a monthly amount specifies the maximum contract payment per month. <BR><BR>4.1.1.2. For services for which the method of surveillance is periodic inspection, customer complaint, or MIS reports, the maximum payment is specified by the item listing in the bid schedule accumulated to a monthly price that you will be paid for the listed task.<BR><BR>5. Examples of payment computation.<BR><BR>5.1. For services for which sampling is the method of surveillance:<BR><BR>5.1.1. Assume an AQL of 6.5%, a lot size of 450 units, a resulting sample size of 50 units, and that 10 defects were found by our surveillance.  The Master Table for Single Sampling Plans for Normal Inspection in ANSI/ASQC Z1.4. indicates that the reject level if 8 defective samples.<BR>The payment computation would be as follows:<BR>(1) Maximum bid schedule item payment $10,000 this month <BR>(2) Maximum payment percentage for x 5% the service (PRS, column 5)<BR>(3) Maximum payment for acceptable $500 services ((1) times (2) above)<BR>(4) 10 defects exceed reject level of 8 defects<BR>(5) Percentage of sample found 20% unacceptable (number defects divided by sample size times 100)<BR>(6) Percentage of sample found acceptable 80% (100% minus percentage of sample found unacceptable from (5) above)<BR>(7) Credit for 2 sample defects + 4% corrected (samples corrected divided by lot size times 100)<BR>(8)  Acceptable percentage 84% (6) plus (7) above)<BR>(9) Payment for percentage of acceptable $420 service ((3) times (8) above) <BR><BR>5.2. For services for which the method of surveillance is other than sampling:<BR><BR>5.2.1. Assume an AQL of 5%, a lot size of 50 units, and that 5 defects were found by the<BR>Government.  The payment would be computed as follows: <BR>(1) Maximum accumulated line item $10,000 payment this month<BR>(2) Maximum payment percentage for x 4% the service (PRS, column 5)<BR>(3) Maximum payment for acceptable $400 service ((1) times (2) above)<BR>(4) 5 defects exceed reject level of 3 <BR>3 defects (AQL times lot size = 2.5 defects rounded up to 3)<BR>(5) Percentage of lot found unacceptable 10% (5 defects divided by lot size times 100)<BR>(6) Percentage of lot found acceptable 90% (100% minus percentage of lot found unacceptable from (5) above)<BR>(7) Payment for percentage of acceptable $360 service ((3) times (6) above)<BR><BR>5.3. For services for which surveillance is less often than monthly:<BR><BR>5.3.1. Assume surveillance is semiannual; the AQL is 4%; and we find a defect rate of 10%  during surveillance.  Also assume the percentage of the total contract line item price for the service is 4%.  The payment would be computed as follows:<BR>(1) Monthly contract line item payment $10,000<BR>(2) Number of months represented by the x 6 period since the last surveillance<BR>(3) Total maximum payment for the period $60,000<BR>(4) Percent of monthly contract line x 4% item price<BR>(5) Total maximum payment for the service $ 2,400<BR>(6) Percentage acceptable (100% minus 10%) x 90%<BR>(7) Contractor's payment for the period $ 2,160<BR>(8)  Amount previously paid for the period -2,000 ($10,000 times 4% = $400; 5 months times $400 = $2,000)<BR>(9) Payment to you this month $160 <BR><BR><BR>General.  The Sampling Plan, when completed, is a document which will tell the COR how much inspection is required to be performed on each service each month.  In addition, it becomes the yardstick for measuring performance, acceptance or rejection level for each service.<BR><BR>Source of Information.  The source document used to obtain the necessary information to complete the monthly Sampling Plan is the contract Performance Requirements Summary (PRS).<BR><BR>Procedures.  The COR will develop the Sampling Plan each month for all services listed in column 1 of the contract PRS.  The American National Standard Sampling Procedures and Tables for Inspection by Attributes (ANSI/ASQCZ1.4) will be used to determine the number of samples (inspections) along with accept and reject level of each service.  The Army standard for determining the lot size (population) for random sampling is expressed in the formula: "The total number of service orders for all facilities each month" (ref column 3 of the PRS).<BR> <BR>Determining the Lot Size.  The lot size is determined from the formula in column 3 of the PRS.  The Army standard for determining the lot size (population) for random sampling is: "the total number of service orders for all facilities each month" (see column 3 of the PRS).<BR>The COR must determine how many service orders each facility is anticipated to be performed each month.  <BR><BR>Determining the Sample Size.  To determine the sample size (number of inspections) single, normal degree sampling will initially be used until such time contract performance dictates otherwise.  The COR will use Inspection Level II unless human resources are not adequate to perform the number of given inspections in addition to other required inspections.  The KO must concur with any changes in the level and degree of sampling which deviates from this standard.<BR><BR>Obtaining the AQL.  The Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) is a given as stated in column 5 of the PRS.  The AQL is expressed as a percentage and is derived from ANSI/ASQCZ1.4 Standard (see above).  The AQLs will remain the same throughout the contract unless changed by contract modification.<BR><BR>Accept/Reject Levels.  Each service listed on the PRS will be measured against the AQL expressed as a number of defects allowed.  The accept/reject numbers are obtained by using the ANSI/ASQCZ1.4 Standard applying the AQL to the sample size (see above).<BR> <BR>Contract will be FFP, FOB Destination. <BR><BR>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular Fac 2005-45, Effective 01 Oct 2010.

<p>The Justification for Brand Name or Equal is based on compatibility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The FBI has deployed an extensive quantity of Harris T1 channel banks in support of telecommunications connectivity for the FBI's Land Mobile Radio System (LMRS).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Harris ACS-167 T1 channel bank is electrically similar to the Harris ACS-163 T1 channel bank and both will accommodate and operate with the same resource modules, i.e., DV-600, DS-961DG, VF-25s, Nx64 and CM-5RB T1 Interface cards, but with the smaller ACS-167 having fewer resource mounting slots available for modules, given that it is a single rack high unit and quite smaller than the ACS-163 unit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Harris T1 channel banks (ACS-163/167) enable the FBI to transport Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) radio communications within various FBI divisions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Harris ACS-163/167 multiplexer platforms are utilized to ensure compatibility with existing FBI owned Harris Corporation T1 multiplexers interface modules and specifically the Harris DV-600 circuit cards which the FBI utilizes to transport SBU encrypted voice employing 12Kb/s digital voice privacy (DVP) radio communications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The extensive quantities of DV-600, owned by the FBI, will only interface and operate within a Harris T1 channel bank shelf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The necessity to deploy additional T1 circuits as utilized to support the LRMS requires the procurement of fully compatible Harris T1 channel banks and T1 Redundant Common Modules as identified above.</p>

<DESC>The George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center of the Department of State is the federal government's primary training facility for personnel of the foreign affairs community. The Foreign Service<br />Institute (FSI) is the Department bureau that provides training for employees of the Department of State and other agencies at the Shultz Center. The Transition Center offers security awareness training to foreign affairs agency personnel and their eligible family members in the form of the Security Overseas Seminar (SOS) program. Over two thousand participants attend per year, from many U.S. Government agencies. Classes range from 30 to 170 with average class size being around 80. Their level of experience in the Foreign Service varies from newcomers in the overseas environment to veterans with twenty years or more of service and their family members and members of household. This variance is both a benefit and a challenge. Newcomers appreciate the firsthand experiences related by veterans, but presenters must be careful to avoid an elementary approach that will bore those with more experience. It is important to acknowledge this varied spectrum of experience present among the audience members and allow them to share their acquired knowledge through interactive and engaging activities.

It is a well established platform for both HTS and diagnostics from animal samples, including tissues and fluids. It is therefore, a true bench-to-bed assay platform. The basis of the technology: 1) the Luminex color-coded beads, called microspheres (100 distinct sets). Each bead set can be coated with a reagent specific to a particular bioassay (antibody for proteins or oligo probes for mRNA), allowing the capture and detection of desired specific analytes from a sample. 2) Detection of each analyte on each distinct microsphere using Luminex analyzer. The Luminex analyzer (Luminex FLEXMAP-3D) resembles a flow cytometer with lasers to excite the internal dyes that identify each microsphere particle, and also any reporter dye captured during the assay. The FLEXMAP-3D accommodates 96- and 384-well plates and therefore is compatible with standard HTS microplates.<br /><br />Qty-1, Item Description-FLEXMAP 3D SYSTEM XPONENT 4<br />Qty-1, Item description-XL200TM, TOUCH SCREEN MONITOR<br /><br />The Offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial; 2) FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<DESC>Question:  Will you please specify an aluminum grade?  5052 or 5086 is traditional for marine environments or 6061 for structural strength.
Answer:  The bowsprit frame is in good condition so 5052 al would do to replace the decking only keeping the current support frame.
The condition the dive platform supporting frame is unknown.  If the frame is good 5052 can be used on the platform, if the frame needs to be modified or replaced, then 6061 should be used for the frame work and 5052 can be used on the decking.
Photographs of the vessel can be viewed at http://www.fws.gov/filedownloads/ftp_R7CGS/USFWSR7Bertram63/

Question: Do you have any idea how thick the current teak is on both the bowsprit and swimstep?
Answer: Approximately 3/8 inch  
Question: Do you intend to award both bid items or is one more important than the other? 
Answer: We intend to award both. 
Question: Can you provide any drawings or photos of the vessel
Answer:  Please see Photos at  http://www.fws.gov/filedownloads/ftp_R7CGS/USFWSR7Bertram63/

<DESC><p>The above solicitation is hereby amended to address vendor questions and answers and to extend the due date for quotes as follows:</p>
<p>1. The primary mirror - Do you care what material it is made of?</p>
<p>Answer: The mirror material does not matter explicitly, but there are implicit requirements contained within the image quality requirement. As long as the glass material properties are taken into account in the optomechanical design such that the optical performance (i.e. spot size) specification is met over normal observatory operation temperatures and gravity loading, then the specific glass material does not matter.</p>
<p>2. The focal ratio - Does "slower" mean that f/8 is acceptable?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, slower in this sense means the light path is converging more slowly than f/6.</p>
<p>3. Field of view and spot size - Does the "&lt;10 micron RMS" apply to all wavelengths and the entire field, or to one particular wavelength and one part of the field? For example, a 22" diameter, f/6 primary mirror has an airy disk diameter of 15.6 microns on axis at 1.064 nm, which seems to exceed the specification.</p>
<p>Answer: Entire field, all wavelengths.</p>
<p>4. Optical Design - How much back focal length (distance from the back of the mirror mounting plate to the focal plane) do you need?</p>
<p>Answer: A back focal distance of 50-150mm past the instrument mounting point, which is either the backplate of the mirror cell if focus is on the secondary mirror or the back surface of rear focuser if the focus is controlled behind the primary cell.</p>
<p>5. Optical Design and Tube - How much focal shift with temperature is permitted?</p>
<p>Answer: Our instrument is relatively insensitive to focus drifts and can tolerate up to +/- 1mm over the course of a typical nightly 20 C temperature swing. However, it is expected that with modern telescope mechanical designs, through passive structural design elements and/or active temperature-based focus feedback, far tighter focus can be maintained.</p>
<p>6. Tube - What is the maximum acceptable tube length?</p>
<p>Answer: The critical dimension is the tube clearance within the enclosure so is not strictly the tube length. The maximum distance on the telescope structure from intersection of the altitude and azimuth axes should not exceed 48".</p>
<p>7. Mount - What is your desired pointing resolution and accuracy? What electrical power is available?</p>
<p>Pointing resolution, 0.1 arcseconds rms or better. Pointing/tracking accuracy, unguided &lt; 5 arcseconds rms including uncorrected periodic error. Guided &lt; 0.5 arcseconds rms. Electrical power is standard 120V service.</p>
<p>8. The delivery date is specified to be 3 months after receipt of order. That is a very short lead time for optics. Is there some leeway on this delivery requirement?</p>
<p>Answer: No, delivery must be within 3 months after receipt of order to meet our current deadlines for projects that require this equipment.</p>
<p>The due date/time for quotes has been extended as follows:<br />FROM: January 20, 2011 @ 3pm EST<br />TO: January 27, 2011 @ 3pm EST</p>

<DESC><p>The above solicitation is hereby amended to incorporate quantity and technical changes to Line Item 0001 and include revised drawing (044-0002-2) drawing 044-002 is hereby deleted. The due date/time, January 27, 2011 @ 3pm EST remains unchanged.</p>
<p>The quantity and technical changes for Line Item 0001 are as follows:</p>
<p>FROM:<br /><br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a block of pure bismuth to be used as filter material. <br /><br />The Department of Commerce and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have developed a major national facility for neutron scattering. This project provides for over fifteen unique instrument stations for use by national and international researchers for materials research. In addition, instruments are also provided for fundamental physics research, neutron interferometry, and neutron optics.</p>
<p>To remain at the forefront of science, the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) is continuously developing new and improved instruments for neutron scattering. NIST requires an accurately dimensioned rectangular block made from pure, single-crystal bismuth. This bismuth block shall be cryogenically cooled and shall be located upstream of a new instrument named the Chromatic Analysis Neutron Diffractometer or Reflectometer (CANDOR) and shall be used as a gamma ray filter for CANDOR. <br /><br />This block of pure bismuth shall be made up of several large crystals and shall be used to filter out unwanted gamma rays from the neutron beam. Single-crystal bismuth is known to be affective in attenuating gamma rays whose high energy can distort the purity of the thermal neutrons. Single crystal and large crystal bismuth has much higher transmission of neutrons between .4nm and .8nm than small crystal (fine grained) polycrystalline due to the minimization of Bragg scattering by reducing the number of individual crystals. Cooling the bismuth has the effect of making the crystals become nearly transparent to thermal neutrons and remain nearly opaque to high energy gamma rays.</p>
<p>All responsible quoters shall provide a quotation for the following line item:</p>
<p>LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each, bismuth block (that shall be made up of several large single crystals), which satisfies the material and end product specifications defined herein to achieve the desired performance as a gamma ray filter.</p>
<p>(A) Bulk Materials Specification:</p>
<p>CAS No.: The bismuth used shall be in accordance with the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number 7440-69-9.<br />Purity: The bismuth must be 99.999% pure.</p>
<p>(B) Crystal End Product Specification:</p>
<p>Crystal Characteristics: One structure that is composed of several large crystals shall be grown, that will be irregularly shaped, eg some round and some rectangular. The minimum dimension of any irregular shape shall be 25mm.</p>
<p>Process Characteristics: After the structure of large crystals has been grown, it shall be cut, machined, fine ground and etched (to remove the deformed layer and reveal crystal boundaries) to the Physical Dimensions described in Section C. <br /><br />Density: The density of the end product shall be within 0.5% of the theoretical density of bismuth to ensure that there are not significant voids in the material. The room temperature density of bismuth is 9.78 g/cm&sup3;.</p>
<p>Physical Characteristics: The following specifications ensure that the bismuth block can be mounted as a mechanical body without shedding toxic parts:</p>
<p>1. Shear Modulus - 1,700 kpsi<br />2. Young's Modulus - 4,500 kpsi<br />3. No cracks permissible<br />4. Largest dimension of corner or edge chip &lt; 2mm<br />5. Number of chips allowable with size less than 2mm, 6-8 per piece</p>
<p>( C) Physical Dimensions: <br />The material shall be delivered as one accurately dimensioned block. The physical dimensions, tolerances and surface finish are specified on the attached drawing 044-0002.</p>
<p>TO:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for two blocks of pure bismuth to be used as filter material.</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have developed a major national facility for neutron scattering. This project provides for over fifteen unique instrument stations for use by national and international researchers for materials research. In addition, instruments are also provided for fundamental physics research, neutron interferometry, and neutron optics.</p>
<p>To remain at the forefront of science, the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) is continuously developing new and improved instruments for neutron scattering. NIST requires two accurately dimensioned, identical rectangular blocks made from pure, single-crystal bismuth. These bismuth blocks shall be cryogenically cooled and shall be located upstream of a new instrument named the Chromatic Analysis Neutron Diffractometer or Reflectometer (CANDOR) and shall be used as a gamma ray filter for CANDOR.</p>
<p>These 2 blocks of pure bismuth shall be made up of several large crystals and shall be used to filter out unwanted gamma rays from the neutron beam. Single-crystal bismuth is known to be affective in attenuating gamma rays whose high energy can distort the purity of the thermal neutrons. Single crystal and large crystal bismuth has much higher transmission of neutrons between .4nm and .8nm than small crystal (fine grained) polycrystalline due to the minimization of Bragg scattering by reducing the number of individual crystals. Cooling the bismuth has the effect of making the crystals become nearly transparent to thermal neutrons and remain nearly opaque to high energy gamma rays.</p>
<p>All responsible quoters shall provide a quotation for the following line item:</p>
<p>LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity two (2), bismuth blocks (that shall be made up of several large single crystals), which satisfies the material and end product specifications defined herein to achieve the desired performance as a gamma ray filter.</p>
<p>(A) Bulk Materials Specification:</p>
<p>CAS No.: The bismuth used shall be in accordance with the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number 7440-69-9.<br />Purity: The bismuth must be 99.999% pure.</p>
<p>(B) Crystal End Product Specification:</p>
<p>Crystal Characteristics: Two structures that are composed of several large crystals shall be grown. These crystals will be irregularly shaped, eg some round and some rectangular,(Note: the average size of a crystal will be around 25mm but there is no minimum dimension because the shapes are too irregular).</p>
<p>Process Characteristics: After the two blocks of large crystals have been grown, they shall be cut, machined, fine ground and etched (to remove the deformed layer and reveal crystal boundaries) to the Physical Dimensions described in Section C. <br /><br />Density: The density of the end product shall be within 0.5% of the theoretical density of bismuth to ensure that there are not significant voids in the material. The room temperature density of bismuth is 9.78 g/cm&sup3;.</p>
<p>Physical Characteristics: The following specifications ensure that the bismuth blocks can be mounted as mechanical bodies without shedding toxic parts:</p>
<p>1. Shear Modulus - 1,700 kpsi<br />2. Young's Modulus - 4,500 kpsi<br />3. No cracks permissible<br />4. Largest dimension of corner or edge chip &lt; 2mm<br />5. Number of chips allowable with size less than 2mm, 6-8 per piece</p>
<p>( C) Physical Dimensions: <br />The material shall be delivered as two accurately dimensioned, identical blocks. The physical dimensions, tolerances and surface finish are specified on the attached drawing 044-0002-2.</p>

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial supplies prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 under Simplified Acquisition procedures in Subpart 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this acquisition is NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2011-074-RSF and is being issued as a Request for Quote. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-48. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325414 and the business size standard is 500 employees.<br /><br />The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), has a requirement for one Luminex #FM3D000 Flexmap 3D System with XPONENT Software and one Touch Screen Monitor. <br /><br />The bead-based Luminex technology is an assay platform that allows for both single and multiplexed measurements of both mRNA and proteins of interest. It is a well established platform for both HTS and diagnostics from animal samples, including tissues and fluids. It is therefore, a true bench-to-bed assay platform. The basis of the technology: 1) the Luminex color-coded beads, called microspheres (100 distinct sets). Each bead set can be coated with a reagent specific to a particular bioassay (antibody for proteins or oligo probes for mRNA), allowing the capture and detection of desired specific analytes from a sample. 2) Detection of each analyte on each distinct microsphere using Luminex analyzer. The Luminex analyzer (Luminex FLEXMAP-3D) resembles a flow cytometer with lasers to excite the internal dyes that identify each microsphere particle, and also any reporter dye captured during the assay. The FLEXMAP-3D accommodates 96- and 384-well plates and therefore is compatible with standard HTS microplates.<br /><br />Qty-1, Item Description-FLEXMAP 3D SYSTEM XPONENT 4<br />Qty-1, Item description-XL200TM, TOUCH SCREEN MONITOR<br /><br />The Offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial; 2) FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROT</strong>ESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: <br />The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research was established in 1989. Its reauthorizing legislation (42 U.S.C. 299 et seq; "Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999") renamed it the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and established it as the lead Federal agency whose mission was to enhance the quality, appropriateness, and effectiveness of health services and access to such services for all Americans. AHRQ's mission is to produce "measurable improvements in health care in America, gauged in terms of improved quality of life and patient outcomes, lives saved, and value gained for what we spend." Under the Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999 (S 580), which reauthorized AHRQ, AHRQ's reauthorizing legislation stated that, "The Agency shall promote health care quality improvement by conducting and supporting- (1) research that develops and presents scientific evidence regarding all aspects of health care, including- (2) methods for measuring quality and strategies for improving quality; and (3) initiatives to advance private and public efforts to improve health care quality." (cite http://www.ahrq.gov/hrqa99a.htm)</p>
<p>To achieve its mission, the Agency conducts and supports a broad base of scientific research and promotes improvements in clinical and health system practices, including the prevention of diseases and other health conditions. AHRQ sponsors and conducts research that develops and presents evidence-based information on healthcare outcomes, quality, comparative effectiveness, patient safety, cost, use and access. Included in AHRQ's mandate is support of the generation, synthesis, and dissemination of scientific evidence, including effectiveness research and analytic methods.</p>
<p>In particular, AHRQ's role in supporting efforts in these areas has included measurement for purposes of quality improvement and accountability. In part as a result of the recent enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), AHRQ's role has increased in the following areas: <br />&bull; supporting scientifically-based measurement research; <br />&bull; developing products that advance quality improvement, public reporting, and other accountability efforts that focus on the goals of the ACA;<br />&bull; developing measurement tools that address the most pressing concerns of those who deliver, manage, pay for, or receive health care services.</p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) seeks to expand access to care while at the same time improving the quality and efficiency of that care. Achieving this goal requires the ability to measure, report, and track quality and efficiency accurately in a way that is meaningful to those in a position to improve care - health care providers, policy-makers, payers, consumers, and others. In the past decade, there has been a major growth in the transparency of provider-level quality reporting, supported by a concomitant increase in the number of measures used to track quality and efficiency. The challenge now is to identify, develop, and maintain a parsimonious set of measures that are evidence-based and meet the needs of stakeholders. Furthermore, the goal is to continue to improve these measures over time, to take advantage of new evidence and improvements in data availability resulting, for example from the enactment of Meaningful Use and new data investments under ARRA. Task Orders under this contract will enable HHS and the Secretary to fulfill several aspects of the ACA (HR3590 sections 3013, 3015, 10303, 10304, 10305 and the measurement aspects of 4302), which are authorized in the legislation.</p>
<p><br />PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:<br />The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is looking for firms which have the capability to develop evidence-based measures of quality and efficiency for quality improvement, public reporting and pay for performance initiatives using a well documented and systematic process. Strong, evidence-based, credible, and usable measures of quality and efficiency are essential for improving the delivery of health care. The initiative to conduct this effort is titled Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Measure Development Contract.</p>
<p>Under this initiative, AHRQ intends to establish an infrastructure to support work which connects research and data to develop and facilitate the use of evidence-based health care quality and efficiency measures. The creation of this infrastructure is meant to serve the following Agency goals:</p>
<p>1. Develop transparent, evidence-based measures using all payer all claims data, EHR, administrative data from providers, and/or health registry data via a transparent and systematic process;<br />2. Improve and enhance existing measures using enhanced data and new methodologies;<br />3. Facilitate innovative research in the area of measurement science;<br />4. Facilitate transparency and engage stakeholders in AHRQ measurement initiatives;<br />5. Facilitate transparency of measure methodology;<br />6. Allow rapid and efficient initiation of new measurement activities; <br />7. Improve the coordination of existing measurement projects; <br />8. Conduct measure development activities in a manner that maximizes flexibility, efficiency and effectiveness across AHRQ projects;<br />9. Facilitate the use of strong evidence-based measures and tools created under this mechanism</p>
<p>To achieve this, AHRQ will establish a Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quality (IDIQ) contract under which a set of pre-competed contracts will be awarded to organizations with combined expertise in healthcare quality and performance measurement within areas of quality, efficiency and patient safety. This mechanism would consist of task orders that cover a wide range of measurement activities including generation of evidence, establishing standards measure and data formats, supporting measure specification and tool implementation, creating survey measure tools as well as other activities.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:<br />AHRQ is seeking qualified firms able to optimize their technical and management resources, creativity and flexibility to achieve Agency goals. Qualified firms must demonstrate substantial experience in developing and supporting an evidence-based measure development cycle and/or a systematic, evidence-based tool development cycle. Tasks will require contractors to manage and coordinate staff in support of developing measures across a broad range of content areas.</p>
<p>Organizations that work at the national, state, regional, local or provider levels and who are engaged in developing, testing and implementing evidence-based quality measures to promote, understand, monitor or leverage evidence-based innovation and performance in health care delivery are encouraged to participate in this offering.</p>
<p>Minimum qualifications include:<br />&bull; A minimum of 10 years' experience working in health services research.<br />&bull; Demonstrated evidence of a minimum of 8 years experience in measure methodologies and tool development<br />&bull; Project leadership with advanced degrees such as an MD, PhD or MPH with a minimum of 10 years' experience in the development, implementation, dissemination and sustainability of evidence-based quality measures. <br />&bull; Corporate experience in measure development initiatives citing a minimum of 8-10 projects over the past 10 years with evidence of knowledge, experience and infrastructure to support health care quality measurement related activities (development, validation, testing etc.).<br />&bull; Corporate expertise in the following four competency areas: analytic data capacity; statistical, methodological and measurement expertise; clinical content expertise by disciplinary area, and tool development capacity.</p>
<p>The capability statement should demonstrate the organization's ability to assist AHRQ in achieving the above stated goals. In particular, Sources must have an understanding of and/or experience in:</p>
<p>&bull; Conducting systematic evidence reviews;<br />&bull; Applying structured communication techniques to obtain clinical and/or methodological input from experts (i.e. Delphi process)<br />&bull; Using Clinical coding systems such as SNOMED, LOINC, CPT/HCPCS coding, ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding; <br />&bull; Conducting complex statistical programming in support of empirical analyses, risk adjustment modeling, composite weighting and other statistical analysis; <br />&bull; Using large, complex datasets (e.g. administrative, clinical etc.) to develop and test new measures; <br />&bull; Managing subcontracts and consultants;<br />&bull; Writing user-friendly, technically accurate reports and documentation;</p>
<p>Sources must possess, or be able to obtain (in-house or through subcontracting/consulting arrangements) the staff and other resources needed to expeditiously carry out the different types of activities listed above.</p>

<DESC>This amendment will incorporate the extension of the closing date to January 24, 2011, 16:30PST.  This extension o time will allow for the incorporation of the changes and updates scheduled for the 3.2.upgrade for the VIPR program that is scheduled on or about January 20, 2011.This amendment also clarifies payment for transports, (both associated with heavy equipment and stand alone).  The solicitation in VIPR will be amended to reflect these changes in a future maintenance cycle:The minimum daily guarantee is applicable to time under hire as defined in D.21.8 below:The time under hire shall start at the time the resource begins traveling to the incident after being ordered by the Government, and end at the estimated time of arrival back to the point of hire after being released, except as provided in D.21.8.3.If the transport (associated with a piece of heavy equipment) is released prior to the heavy equipment and the contractor elects to return the transport to their home base, time under hire would end at the estimated time of arrival back to the point of hire, except as stated in D.21.8.1 below:If the contractor elects to keep the transport at the incident location after it is released by the government, no further payment is due.At the conclusion of the assignment, when the heavy equipment is released, time under hire would begin when the transport begins travel back to the incident.The reference to loaded miles on the Resource Form will be removed at a later time and should be disregarded when quoting prices for the transport(s).  Mileage will be paid for round trip mileage otherwise the minimum daily guarantee is applicable for all time under hire, whichever is greater.End of Amendment.

<DESC>14 January 2011<br />The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) is replacing in its entirety Draft RFP HC1028-10-R-2000 - Global Information Grid (GIG) Services Management-Operations GSM-O) with this Final RFP HC1028-10-R-2000-GSM-O. (The Draft RFP for GSM-O and all attachments thereto shall be deleted from FedBizOpps in its entirety and are superceded with the information received with the Final GSM-O RFP).
<p>DISA/DITCO anticipates a performance based Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract to a single contractor who provides the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>Full and open competition will be utilized to acquire GSM-O requirements including the day-to-day delivery support for telecommunications capabilities, including operating and sustaining the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN), defending the DISN, providing access to new customers, monitoring network health, and restoring service as necessary, plus completing minor adjustments and improvements to existing capabilities. Fundamentally, these activities are necessary to keep the DISN operating and available for use, but include no significant network improvements or changes. Sustainment may consist of small adjustments to the infrastructure, e.g., card replacement, read-only memory (ROM) replacement, or software and hardware upgrades of existing equipment. Operations work is routine and predictable over the contract period except for any contingency support. The geographic scope of the GSM-O requirement is world-wide,</p>
<p>For subcontracting purposes, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes for the GSM-O are designated as 541513 and 517110; size standards are $25M and 1500 employees; respectively.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors are cautioned to review the Final GSM-O RFP in its entirety. Although, questions have been received in response to the Draft RFP for the GSM-O effort and answers have been provided; additional and/or revised information and/or direction has been received which may have resulted in revisions to the answers provided.</p>
<p>Reference RFP HC1028-10-R-2000, Attachments 13 and 14.<br />Supplemental information (Government Furnished Information) will be provided on unclassified, sensitive and/or controlled CD-ROMs. Supplemental information is provided as an historical perspective of the effort that will be required from the GSM-O contractor and it is not to be construed as future work requirements. Supplemental information will not become a contractual requirement. Information considered to be "supplemental information" has been designated on a "Read Me" file included on each CD-ROM.</p>
<p>The Governnment is also providing a sensitive and/or controlled CD-ROM that includes a list of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) that the GSM-O contractor shall maintain. Attachment 14 shall become a contractual requirement and shall be considered an attachment to the resultant contract.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors are encouraged to obtain the unclassified, sensitive and/or controlled CD-ROMs from the Program Management Office during normal work hours in accordance with Section L, Paragraphs L3 and L4 of this solicitation. The CD-ROMs are available at this time.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors are reminded that the information provided on the CD-ROMs (HC1028-10-R-2000 - Attachments 13 and 14) supercedes the information previously provided on earlier versions of the CD-ROMs that were issued in conjunction with the Draft RFP for GSM . You are also reminded to dipose vendors to dispose of the previous disks in accordance with applicable security regulations.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors are encouraged to review the requirement for Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Mitigation Plans. An OCI Mitigation Plan shall be required from all prospective Offerors regardless of whether an actual OCI exists at this time. A contract cannot be awarded to an offeror who does not have an OCI Mitigation Plan that has been deemed acceptable by the Contracting Officer. Consequently, prospective offerors are strongly encouraged to submit and negotiate an OCI Mitigation plan as early as possible.</p>
<p>Examples of recent and relevant past performance will also be evaluated by the Performance Confidence Assessment Group (PCAG). Prospective offerors are requested to submit their examples as to the PCAG as early as possible; but no earlier than 29 Jan 2011 and no later than the proposal due date.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors are also encouraged to support the Wounded Warrior Project (WWP). Assistance on helping wounded warriors transition back into the civilian workforce can be found at: http://wtow.woundedwarriorproject.org/</p>
<p>Supplemental information is provided with this notice to include:<br />1) DISN Labor Cateagory and Descriptions Example<br />2) Matrix of Draft GSM-O Questions/Answers</p>
<p>Proposals in response to this RFP are due in accordance with Section L, Paragraph L7.11 - Proposal Submission by 1:00 P.M. CST on 14 March 2011.</p>
<p>All questions/comments in response to this RFP shall be submitted in writing to the following e-mail account: DISNGSM@disa.mil.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Central Iowa Health Care System in Des Moines, Iowa, Medical Center intends to solicit proposals from contractors in the Des Moines, Iowa metropolitan area to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The solicitation is available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.  Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of the solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available.  The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.

The deadline to submit proposals is Friday, September 17, 2010 1:00 PM CST.  Failure to submit a complete proposal packet will result in the proposal being marked "Incomplete" and it will be not eligible for consideration. 

The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services to meet the needs of those Veterans. Through the HCHV program, VA provides case management services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services. The purpose of the solicitation will be to obtain proposals from contractors who can provide care, treatment and rehabilitative services to veterans suffering from serious mental illness, including veterans who are homeless, in community-based treatment facilities offering a safe and secure environment that supports their rehabilitation goals.  The Contractor will be required to provide therapeutic and rehabilitative services, but will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment - those services will be provided by the VA at VA facilities.  Due to the urgent nature of this requirement, contractors will be required to demonstrate their ability to provide services within a 7 day period after contract award.  Initial contract awards are expected to be on or before September 30, 2010.  Contracts will have a base term of one year, with options for four (4) additional one-year terms exercisable in the discretion of the VA.   

The government will use a best value source selection method under Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and anticipates making multiple awards of fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts for this requirement.

NAICS Code is 624229 and the solicitation will be issued for full and open competition. All responsible sources may submit proposals which shall be considered by the Agency.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration data base at www.ccr.gov.  Registration is free and potential offerors are encouraged to visit that CCR website and register as soon as possible to avoid delays should they be selected for a contract award. Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Cynthia.tabor@va.gov, using the e-mail link provided.

<AWARDEE>MDI Security
<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) intends to award the purchase of "MDI Support and Maintenance for one (1) year, six (6) Visitor Management Module for MDI Safenet System, and six (6) Drivers License Scanner/ ScanShell 1000 w/ MagShell 900.
<p>This acquisition will be made under a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) per FAR part 6.302-2 Urgent and Compelling.</p>
<p>This requirement is urgent and compelling because of Office of Security IG audit and as the Government's security printer; the Bureau's customers and stakeholders expect and demand the highest degree of security. MDI system provides the security measures within the currency manufacturing areas and the adjacent securities storage areas. These security measures provide control, accountability, and Police observation of individuals entering and exiting the high security areas. The Bureau must continue to maintain the highest levels of security at its facilities and seeks to improve wherever possible.</p>
<p>As the manufacturer of the hardware and software, MDI maintains a functional expertise relative to equipment functionality and maintenance, provision of software upgrades, "bugs" etc. They alone have experience with critical items effecting performance. They are also familiar with the Bureau's system and any peculiarities therein since they installed and tested the system and have been performing maintenance support for the last three years.</p>
<p>Their engineers have a working familiarity with equipment functioning and configurations and have accrued technical expertise in resolving systemic difficulties. Limiting the procurement to MDI, provide the Bureau with software upgrades and maintenance, depot hardware repair and/or equipment replacement. The use of any other vendor would pose a risk to Bureau security system operations.</p>
<p>The BEP requires a short term contract to be established to enable sufficient time for the required items and services to be obtained until the requirement itself is re-competed. The BEP anticipates making a competitive award at the beginning of fiscal year 2012.</p>
<p>The hardware and software is proprietary to Monitor Dynamics and its Parent Company.</p>
<p>Contact Mark Anderson, Contract Specialist, at 202-874-6255or Mark.Anderson@bep.gov with any questions regarding this notice.</p>
