<DESC><p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-09-01-RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>DATES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 09 should be submitted by 03 Dec 08; FY 10 by 01 Nov 09; and FY 11 by 01 Nov 10. White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 30 Sep 11, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. See Section IV of this announcement for further details.</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The overall technical objectives of this BAA are to research innovative, disruptive technologies and methods for the automatic and dynamic cueing and collection of intelligence for situational awareness and assessment, with an emphasis on Machine-to- Machine (M2M) capabilities. Technologies, such as artificial intelligence, ontological reasoning, and knowledge-based processing will be used to: (1) Automate the exploitation of collected, processed, and stored information in support of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) within air, space and cyberspace for on-going US missions; (2) Enhance the US exploitation system efficiency, to include multi-platform collections, multi-INT correlation, and resource optimization and management; (3) Dynamically characterize and correlate raw sensor data from existing multi-source, multi-platform, real-time collection systems; and (4) Automate knowledge-based exploitation for Effects-Based Operations (EBO) through assessment, cueing, electronic attack, and battle damage assessment, as a means to achieve mission objectives. These capabilities will enable both automated and "man-on-the-loop" (MoTL) concepts to address the increased volume of data and the increased time criticality of analysis - both of which are necessary to support dynamic exploitation and real-time EBO.</p>
<p>The focus areas of this BAA are to: (1) Dynamically characterize and correlate data sources on existing multi-source, multi-platform, real-time collection systems. (2) Enhance collection system efficiency to include multi-platform collection for dynamic exploitation. (3) Automate knowledge-based assessments to cue sensors and recommend opportunities to achieve mission objectives. (4) Automate exploitation of collected, processed, and stored information in support of ISR and IO for current and future US missions. Some of the particular issues related to these specific focus areas include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) Target specific characteristics for identification/ correlation. Battlefield management depends heavily on multi-intelligence assets to provide current threat analysis for successful deployment of war-fighting resources. One area that supports this analysis is target specific operating characterization and equipment/unit correlation, which is normally a "brute-force/labor intensive" effort. (b) Automated collection, signal ID, and first/second/third order level processing. Dense, hard-to-get, advanced modulated, and Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) signals, as well as movements and hidden assets, dictate the need for automated, dynamic collection using both on-board and off-board assets. Multi-INT &lsquo;fingerprinting' techniques should continue to be investigated as a means of supporting identification and automated tracking efforts. (c) Related enabling engineering constructs and architectures to enable advanced exploitation. For example, the Semantic Service Oriented Architecture (SSOA) construct contextualizes the dynamic knowledge available, thereby enabling dynamic discovery of new services as they become available and providing resources for enabling semantic descriptions of those services. SSOAs enable knowledge acquisition and management over disparate architectures without a priori schema information. Semantic SOA development will provide a flexible way to quickly integrate novel services using an intelligent matching process. We seek approaches which will allow heterogeneous services to seamlessly interoperate and which may include the use of data mediation/intermediary translation services such as data transformation, aggregation, service orchestration and adaptation. A standards based design approach will be used, and as appropriate, will be compliant with all International Standards and with the Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES). (d) Management software aboard platforms and systems which specifically address exploitation mission objectives. Given current levels of activity, operational requirements, hostile environments, and resources being heavily tasked, collection systems will need to be developed for embedding on advanced collection platforms, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Resident management software processing systems will need to accomplish the automated, dynamic collection of intelligence information as well as auto-collaborating with other sensors in order to share information and to derive knowledge. (e) Advanced knowledge-based processing for exploitation. Timely and accurate decision support to the warfighter requires innovative knowledge-based processing for sensor management, emitter and entity identification, and multi-intelligence cross-cueing, to include, but not limited to, techniques for automated knowledge acquisition and knowledge modeling, real-time inferencing, and real-time operating system. (f) Network-centric collection management, data/information exchange and correlation. Networked SIGINT sensors extend the sensor virtual collection space, thus significantly enhancing the potential to collect difficult and hard-to-collect intelligence. Therefore, network centric collection management should be investigated to include, but not be limited to, multi-platform signal correlation and Multi-INT sensor cueing. (g) Advanced Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques for use in a network-centric exploitation environment. This will include new algorithms, techniques and methods for meeting the future needs in the areas of Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Communications Intelligence (COMINT), Audio Processing, Special Signals, Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), Steganographic Intelligence (STEGINT) and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), as well as any combination of these. Consideration should be given to "surgical" exploitation techniques for reducing data and processing requirements through intelligent collection. The development of advanced algorithms which reduce the overall sensor intake, more intelligently process the data among the available resources/nodes, and addresses security, bandwidth, and load-balancing throughout the overall system will be given consideration. The primary focus of this BAA is to have an advanced exploitation capability which effectively enables automated/MoTL exploitation techniques; provides a framework for advanced exploitation, course of action (COA) development, correlation and cueing, and mission planning techniques developed under this BAA and elsewhere; and supports the integration of ISR, network-operations and other intelligence gathering while decreasing the demand for bandwidth in support of collection and intelligence generation.</p>

No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RIEC will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>

<DESC>CPSG has embarked on a secure voice cryptographic modernization (CM) program for the KY-57, KY-99A, KY-58, KY-100 and CV-3591/KYV-5 COMSEC products. CPSG plans to field a modernized version of this equipment that meets the National Security Agency (NSA) Central Security Service (CSS) Policy Number 3-9.The VINSON/ANDVT Cryptographic Modernization (VACM) Program Office is planning an approach to replace specific, stand-alone, secure voice cryptographic devices. The basic strategy involves the development of:
A single NSA Type-1 certified crypto module that will be common to all VACM devices. This module will define the cryptographic boundary; as a result, only one NSA certification will be required.
A single, new ground chassis which will be a crypto-modernized form/fit/functional replacement for the KY-57 and KY-99A. This single ground chassis must utilize the VACM crypto module and accommodate all existing interfaces (though not necessarily simultaneously) for both ground legacy devices.
A single, new airborne chassis which will be a crypto-modernized form/fit/functional replacement for the KY-58, KY-100, and KYV-5/CV-3591. This single airborne chassis must utilize the VACM crypto module and accommodate all existing interfaces (though not necessarily simultaneously) for all three airborne legacy devices.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement to obtain one 40 channel main driver board and one 40 channel shim power supply for a Varian Inova600 NMR spectrometer.
This action is being pursued on a sole source basis with Varian, Inc because the parts are needed to repair an existing Varian Inova600 NMR spectrometer and need to be supplied by the manufacturer. The parts must conform to the exact specifications and physical dimensions as the existing equipment without modification.
NAICS Code 334516 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response merely requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 11/12/08.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Will Goins (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

These projects will be no more frequent than once a month, but will involve a much more substantial investment of time and preparation than day-to-day requests for information. These efforts should be reported in a unified quarterly written report to the COTR.<BR><BR>4.5 The quarterly written report will be structured in four parts: 1) Summary Report on Documents Added to the CALL Archives (from Deliverable 4.3); 2) Report on Support for Special Projects (Deliverable 4.4); 3) Recommendations on Improvement of the CALL RFI System and on Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) impacting the RFI Analyst Cell (Deliverable 4.2); 4) RFI Responses (Deliverable 4.1). <BR><BR>4.6 A trip report, setting out information relevant to the purpose and success of the travel, shall be completed and delivered to the Research Division Chief within 3 days of return from authorized travel.<BR><BR>5.0 PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS AND QUALIFICATIONS:<BR><BR>5.1 Shall have extensive experience and expertise in U.S. Army and/or joint operations.<BR><BR>5.2 Five (5) years of experience that shows demonstrated ability to conduct effective and efficient searches of the NIPRNet and SIPRNet using state-of-the-art search engines in order to provide requested information to CALL customers.<BR><BR>5.3 Shall be able to use the current Microsoft Office software suite and Adobe Acrobat. <BR><BR><BR>6.0 GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING:<BR><BR>6.1 Training on CALL methodology, SOPs, CALL Archives architecture, and Convera RetrievalWare software.<BR><BR>6.2 Annual Antiterrorism Level 1, SAEDA, and OPSEC training.<BR><BR>6.3 Office space with phone service, paper, reproduction equipment, and other supplies as required.<BR><BR>6.4 All necessary computer hardware, software, and other services required to perform the tasks.<BR><BR>6.5 Familiarization training, as available and appropriate, for current concepts on the operational and tactical levels of war, the Army Universal Task List and the Universal Joint Task List and development of a working knowledge of the strategic level of war.<BR><BR>6.6  Accountability for Government Property.  The contractor shall acknowledge the receipt of Government provided accountable property, to include all assigned computer equipment in accordance with all applicable accountability procedures.  The contractor will use reasonable care and diligence in accordance with FAR 52.245-2 to ensure the safety and security of all government furnished property.

<DESC>Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-enabled Network (CROWN)
Systems Development & Maintenance

Introduction:  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide systems development and maintenance services to support the Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-enabled Network (CROWN) application group.

History:  The Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-enabled Network (CROWN) application group, supports the End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Network program, ESRD dialysis providers, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) community.  CROWN is an application group currently consisting of the Renal Management Information System (REMIS), the Standard Information Management System (SIMS), and the Vital Information System to Improve Outcomes in Nephrology (VISION) along with all associated databases and architecture.  In February 2009 the first version of two new systems, (CROWNWeb) and the QualityNet Identity Provisioning System (QIPS), will be placed in production.  These new systems will become part of the CROWN application group and SIMS and VISION will be retired.

Prior to CROWN, each ESRD Network was responsible for developing solutions to meet the data entry and reporting requirements of their Statement of Work.  Besides the obvious inefficiencies of redundant systems and costs, each ESRD Network had different competencies related to automated data processing (ADP) activities.  Since the inception of CROWN, the functions of CROWN have encompassed support, standardization, and development of data, software, and standards for the ESRD Network community.  With the release of CROWNWeb V1.0, CROWN will continue to evolve with innovative technology to meet the challenges of supporting and interfacing directly with the ESRD Network community and surrounding healthcare industry.

The CROWN User Community refers to the ESRD Networks, ESRD dialysis facilities, CMS Central and Regional Offices, and other organizations/partners that may be incorporated in support of CMS initiatives.  This application group services the daily, ongoing support that the CROWN User Community needs to fulfill their contractual requirements in a manner supportive of an ongoing quality improvement program, a legislatively mandated ESRD patient registry (See Public Law 95-292, Section (c)(1)(A); 42 CFR, Chapter IV, Part 476; and Public Law 92-603, Section 299I), and the 2008 ESRD Provider Conditions for Coverage.

The current contractor that develops and maintains the CROWN application group is Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC).  The estimated level-of-effort for this work is approximately 75,000 hours per year.

The vast majority of business requirements for the CROWN application group are collected and defined by another contractor; however, the contractor for this work shall participate in the review and refinement of these business requirements and then shall perform a system and resource impact analysis for each requirement. The work during this phase will culminate in the setting of scope for the next release.  The business requirements defined during the Business Requirements Definition phase shall be translated by the contractor into specific application requirements through the inventory and catalogue of functional requirements  functional requirements must be traceable back to the business requirements. These definition phases shall follow standard SDLC processes, procedures, and documentation guidelines.

4.  The contractor shall assist CMS with project management of all products through the System Development Life Cycle.

<DESC>8(a) Set-Aside (competitive):  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has a requirement for Special Property Inspection Services.  The contractor shall furnish all supervision, labor, transportation, materials, equipment, documentation and other requirements as necessary to complete the contract requirements unless otherwise specified in the contract.  

Brief summary of the performance work statement:  The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), administers the Single Family Mortgage Insurance Program. Upon default and foreclosure of an FHA insured loan, the lender files a claim for insurance benefits.  In exchange for payment of a claim, a lender conveys a foreclosed property to HUD.  HUD, through a Management and Marketing (M&M) contractor, then manages and sells a sizable inventory of single family homes in a manner that promotes home ownership, preserves communities and maximizes return to the FHA insurance fund.  In addition, the M&M Contractor secures and manages Secretary-Held properties.  To report the physical condition of properties under management by M&M contractors, HUD requires the services of Special Property Inspection (SPI) Contractors (referred to as Contractor hereafter) to perform all necessary inspection activities on its behalf. Under the immediate contract, the Contractor shall inspect and report to HUD the condition of the property. The primary objectives of the proposed contracts are to: (1) inspect and report to HUD the physical condition of each property; (2) report failed Inspections, that do not contain health and safety issues, within 2 days after discovery; (3) report inspections that contain health and safety issues and need immediate attention no later than 1 day after discovery; (4) complete all inspections no later than 10 days from assignment; and (5) post all property inspections with pictures on the Internet based website.  Performance under this contract shall ensure that:  (1) inspections are completed daily, but not later than 10 days from the date assigned; (2) the inspection form will be completed in its entirety; (3) failed inspections and pictures, that do not contain health and safety issues are posted, no later than 2 days of inspection, to the Internet website; (4) inspections and pictures that contain health and safety issues are posted, no later than 1 day of inspections, to the Internet website; and (5) internal quality management will ensure that errors in inspections, forms and pictures are minimal. A draft copy of the performance work statement is attached. 

There may be one or two contracts awarded.  The two areas are:  Area One:  PC- New York and New Jersey; PD-Maryland and District of Columbia; PE- Pennsylvania and Delaware; PF-Virginia and West Virginia; and PH-Ohio.  Area Two: PA-New England States of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island; and PG-Michigan.  The estimated yearly inspections for each area are 6,375 and 9,425 respectively.

 Each contract will be for a base period of 12 months and four (4) - 12 month option periods.  The estimated value of each of the contracts (base plus 4 options) is over $3.5 million. The NAICS code is 541350 with a size standard of $7 million. 

Interested 8(a) small business concerns need to respond to this inquiry by November 13, 2008 at 4:00pm MST with the required information as stated below.  Fax the information to (303) 672-5062, Attn:  Randa Usel or to by e-mail to Randa.F.Usel@HUD.gov.  Telephone calls will not be considered. You must plan ahead to ensure receipt of the submission by the closing date and time. 

The information provided will be used to determine if the requirement should be set-aside for the identified 8(a) small business category.  Failure to provide the mandatory required information in order for a preliminary assessment to be made will result in the effort being advertised for other types of competition. No solicitation document exists at this time and only submitting requests for one without providing the mandatory required information will result in being considered as nonresponsive to this notice.

<CONTACT>Cynthia M Spencer, Phone 4109653369, Fax 4109659560, Email cynthia.spencer@ssa.gov
<DESC>BACKGROUND--Social Security touches the lives of all Americans, young and old alike. This year over 17 million people will receive a new or reissued Social Security Card, many of them infants. Approximately 163 million people are employed in jobs covered by Social Securitys provisions for Retirement, Survivors & Disability benefits.  Additionally, 54 million individuals will receive monthly benefit payments from Social Security programs.   In order for the Social Security Administration (SSA) to support its mandated programs, it operates a very large enterprise database environment, containing more than 70 Terabytes of data.  These data are the foundation for SSAs processing systems.  These data are used to provide information for the citizens of the United States, including all those who have received a Social Security Number (SSN), are employed, or have applied for or are receiving, Social Security benefits or Supplementary Security Income payments.  Effective and efficient management of these data is vital to SSAs mission to provide accurate benefits and efficient service to the American public, today and in the future.  The Social Security Act of 1935, signed into law on August 14, 1935, established the Social Security program.  SSA operations began in the fall of 1936, with the issuance of a SSN to each worker covered by the provisions of that Act. Today, more than 70 years later, the data created by that process (i.e. the identity of those individuals and their respective SSNs) and the ensuing earning recordation are still a vital and necessary part of SSAs active enterprise data holdings.  Thus, unlike most modern information technology environments, SSAs databases contain, by necessity, data spanning the entire 72-year period of the Social Security programs existence. Data collected in 1936 are still relevant today, not just for historical purposes, but for contemporary and future processing. Since the beginning, Social Security has strived to employ the best available technology to provide the best service to the American public in the most efficient manner.  In the 1930s and 1940s, that technology was Electronic Accounting Machines with data stored on punched cards. (Purportedly, SSA was the largest user of punch cards during that timeframe.)  In the mid 1950s, Social Security became one of the first organizations to enter the computer age, transferring data stored in punch cards to magnetic tape and developing batch computer systems to run on mainframe computers with 20K of memory. Throughout the 1950s and 60s, as SSA acquired succeeding generations of technology, larger and more sophisticated automated processes were implemented, which, in turn, generated more and more data. In the early 1970s, SSA began building online databases, providing query access through rudimentary networks to our community-based offices. In 1982, SSA launched a 5-year, $600 million Systems Modernization Plan to accelerate the adoption and integration of new technologies. This resulted in a modern systems architecture and infrastructure to support online processing and a database environment supported by IDMS DBMS and Master Data Access Method (MADAM) (an SSA developed database system). Through the remainder of the 1980s and the 1990s, this technical foundation enabled a major transformation of the SSAs systems environment. In 1995, Social Security began construction of the first large-scale repository for unstructured data (image) files to support paperless processing. In the past 10 years, data growth has accelerated, data access has been extended to the Internet, and support for unstructured data has greatly expanded. SSA now operates one of the largest document management systems in the world; and unlike most other major enterprises, data captured or created during each of these eras are still critical to todays business processes.  Current Environment Description--SSAs current production database environment includes support for DB2 v8 for z/OS, Oracle 10g, Microsoft SQL Server, CA/IDMS release 16.4, and SSAs MADAM--a legacy, in-house developed database management tool implemented during the 1980s.   Initiatives are underway to ensure an orderly multiyear transition from MADAM and CA/IDMS to IBMs DB2.  SSA also manages very large document repositories supported by IBMs Content Manager and by Global 360.  The hub of SSAs enterprise database environment is the National Computer Center (NCC) located at the Agencys headquarters complex in Woodlawn, MD, with portions of the data housed at multiple sites around the country. These databases are hosted by a hardware environment consisting primarily of IBM mainframe computers running the IBM z/OS operating system, Sun Microsystems computers running the Solaris operating system, and Hewlett Packard computers running the UNIX operating system.  SSA is also in the process of building the Durham Support Center (DSC), a second data center in Durham, North Carolina.  In addition to the very large enterprise production environment, SSAs also operates a comprehensive multi-tiered enterprise development environment consisting of five separate phases, each supported by its own environment--configured with hardware, software, data and procedures designed to facilitate the efficient and orderly transition of our enterprise application systems through all life cycle phases from development through production implementation.  FUTURE REQUIREMENTS--Over the next decade, SSAs workload is expected to increase significantly.  SSA expects retirement claims to increase by more than 40 percent and disability claims by approximately 10 percent. The first wave of 80 million baby boomers has applied for Social Security benefits, and boomers are expected to seek disability benefits in greater numbers than did previous generations.  SSAs data environment must be prepared to accommodate this tremendous workload increase while maintaining the integrity, availability and accessibility of our enterprise databases.  SSA believes this can be accomplished by continuing the process of identifying and adopting relevant new technologies to better serve the American public.  One of the technologies that SSA is researching is database replication in our DB2 Z/OS platform environment. In order to maintain high availability in some of our critical workloads, SSA has determined the need to employ near instantaneous database replication to geographically dispersed mainframe platforms.  FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS--Therefore, the SSA is seeking to identify organizations having software products that can support database replication for DB2 on the Z/OS mainframe platform. In particular, we are seeking products that must meet the following MANDATORY criteria: 1) operate on the Z/OS 1.10 operating system and have a migration plan for support of future versions; 2) be able to operate in a DB2 Z/OS data sharing environment running DB2 Version 8 and have a migration plan for support of future versions; 3) have products that support near instantaneous database replication at distances greater than 300 miles; 4) be able to replicate uni-directional, bi-directional, or in peer-to-peer mode across multiple sysplexes; 5)  easily installed and managed; 6) must be used in existing large-scale enterprises supporting millions of database transactions; 7) have automated restart and recovery capability (parameter driven, preferably using a real-time customization feature); 8) compatible with Computer Associates Top Secret Enterprise Security product and future versions; 9) ability to operate at an individual database level and not at the DB2 subsystem level; SSA must be able to specify the specific data base to replicate; 10) have a facility to monitor the performance and status of the data replication; 11) provide tools/strategies for resolution of data-conflicts in bi-directional or peer-to-peer replication architecture; 12) be FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) compliant; 13) have the ability to encrypt replication transmissions; 14) be a mature solution in use for at least 5 years; and, 15) be currently used by more than one customer.  We are seeking the following OPTIONAL ability criteria for the product: 1) replicate VSAM data; and 2) replicate CA-IDMS release 16.4 data and have a migration plan for support of future version of CA-IDMS. VENDOR Responses--Vendors who have products that support large, geographically dispersed organizations to implement DB2 database replication with very large database environments and supporting a large number of end users are invited to submit information concerning their past experience in performing those services.  Detailed responses should be provided addressing each of the above criteria.  The responses should include, where possible, case studies of existing large-scale installations where the product has been employed. Vendors should also include client contact information for their cited engagements.  Vendor responses should provide detailed accounts of1) the company/organization to which the vendor provided the product and services; 2) a reference contact at the company (name, title, email, phone number); 3) what the customer provided; 4) what services the vendor provided; 5) description and make up of the team that provided the services; 6) the duration of the engagement; 7) product documentation: this should also include at a minimum, installation of the product, configuration and set-up of data replication for the source and target, management of data replication, performance benchmarks, management of conflict resolution, and product throughput; and 8) if possible, a rough order of magnitude (ROM) of the cost of the product. It is important to note that simple marketing information or incomplete responses will not be considered an acceptable or valid response, nor will mere references or links to vendor web sites.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Respondents should indicate whether their services/products are available on GSA Federal Supply Schedules or any other Government-wide Agency Contract (GWAC).   This document does not constitute a solicitation for offers.  Request for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be assessed before a final determination is made.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of any Government evaluation of submitted information.  Any responses to this notice should be submitted electronically by 3:00 p.m. ET on November 20, 2008 to Cynthia.Spencer@ssa.gov.  Faxed information will not be permitted. The size limitation for email attachments is 10 megabytes and MS Word 2003 is the Agencys standard word processing software.  Respondents should refer to SSA_DatabaseReplication_FY09.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is currently performing market research to fulfill its requirements for Enterprise Disk Storage Infrastructure and Services.  SSA is seeking information in the form of documentation and a physical presentation from interested sources regarding the below requirements. 

	Support for all Agency Computers, and Operating Systems  The Agencys enterprise applications are spread across four computer operating systems, IBMs MVS, ZOS (Mainframe), Solaris, HP-UX, and Microsoft Windows.  Solaris, HP-UX and Microsoft Windows are considered Open Systems Computers.  All four types of computer operating systems require large amounts of storage.  Please provide channel data speeds for both Main Frame (FICON), and Open System (Fiber).  

	High Performance Enterprise and Departmental Storage Subsystems - For the Social Security Administration Offices, in various geographical locations within the United States. SSA will cumulatively need at least 4.6 raw Petabytes (PB) of Mainframe and Open System Enterprise Storage Data equipment, software, installation, and upgrades during the next three years.  

	Virtual Tape Libraries - including Data Deduplication

	Storage Area Networks (SAN), Directors, and Switches

	An Open Systems product to move data between heterogeneous subsystems

	Storage Design For Inactive Data - Storage should support persistent, inactive data (i.e. data kept online and accessible but not kept on expensive, high-performance storage devices).  
	Thin provisioning - Thin provisioning should allow space to be easily allocated to servers, on a just-enough and just-in-time basis.
	Support for Operating System Data  This feature would be used to boot a computer system from the subsystem.  This option allows the Operating System benefit from all the other features of the Storage Subsystem. 

	Support for Clustered Servers  Two or more a computer systems that are  a grouped together with other resources that act like a single system and enable high availability, load balancing and parallel processing. 

	Scaleable  The ability to support large number of computer systems and large amounts of storage so that storage can be directed to the applications as required. 

	Performance  The speed of the disk data storage platforms enables the Agency to access large amounts of data in shorter periods. As the speed of the storage equipment increases the Agency will reduce end-user response times, and reduce backup windows for online software applications. 

	Flexible Management Software  Management software should be the focal point for storage allocation, performance management and error reporting.   

	Full Data Replication - The ability to make a nearly immediate copy of selected data on the storage subsystem that can then be used for minimizing or eliminating downtime for backups. 

	Incremental Data Replication - The ability to make a nearly immediate copy of just the changed data since the last backup.

	Remote Data Replication - The process of copying data to a second storage subsystem, often housed in a separate location from the originating storage subsystem.  Once the second data center is established, the Agency will implement Remote Data Replication for critical applications. 

	Redundant components - One or more spare components are incorporated into a storage platform by the manufacturer that will continue operating in the event of a hardware failure in the primary part. These backup components can function in one of two ways. They may sit idle, waiting for a failure to occur before being activated or they may operate alongside the primary part to improve performance under normal operating conditions while at the same time possessing the capability to take over completely, and keep the system up and running if the primary part fails. 

	Redundant Data Paths - Each computer system should have at least two independent paths. This feature improves performance and reduces down time. 

	Hot-spare standby drives - Extra drives must be installed in the storage subsystem that automatically comes online and copies the data to the spare drive in the event of a disk failure.  

	Battery backed-up cache - Battery power that protects any data that is in write cache at the time of a power interruption to be written to disk prior to emergency shutdown.  

	Phone-home capability - The ability to detect a failed component or to detect when a component within the Storage Subsystem exceeds certain preset thresholds and alert the storage administrator so that reparative action can be taken. The Agency also configures the Storage Subsystems to contact the subsystems manufacturer automatically when a failure occurs. 

	Non-disruptive microcode updates or replacements - The ability to update or replace the controller microcode without having to shut down the Storage Subsystem. 

This is a sources sought announcement, a market survey for a scheduled presentation and written documentation only. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation. 

This synopsis is for planning purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Responses to this sources sought/market research notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey. 

Interested sources that believe they have the ability to perform the services required should submit a detailed statement of their capabilities in writing and schedule a presentation with Joan Smith, Contract Specialist, Division of Information Technology and Maintenance, 7111 Security Boulevard, 1st Floor Rear Entrance, Baltimore, MD 21244.  Responses must be sent electronically via email at Joan.M.Smith@ssa.gov . Please reference SSA-RFI-JS09-001 in the e-mail subject line. No telephone responses will be accepted. Responses must be received by 5:00 p.m. EST on November 17, 2008.

Sullivan, Contracting Specialist, (410) 436-8403<BR>          DESC:  This is a Request for Information (RFI) prior to a projected Solicitation / Request for Proposal.  The U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, on behalf of the Director for Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E), Office of the Secretary of Defense, requires a contractor to provide engineering and technical analysis support.  DOT&Es responsibilities under Title 10 U.S.C. encompass the assessment of DoD acquisition system test programs and test results, including the approval of Test and Evaluation Master Plans (TEMPS) and Test Plans.  DOT&E also has non-Title 10 responsibilities.  The support to be provided by this contract covers only DOT&Es non-Title 10 responsibilities.  These include the areas of test and evaluation Policy, Regulations, Resources, Agreements, Technology, Treaties, and Management Support.    <BR>	This support will include:<BR>"	program management support;<BR>"	technical support for the analysis of current and proposed T&E policies, processes, training, test infrastructure and test resources;<BR>"	technical and analytic support related to the priorities established by the DOT&E to align with the goals of the DoD.<BR>"	support and analysis of T&E program resource adequacy and resource planning; and<BR>"	liaison and support for the conduct of interoperability (IO) and  information assurance (IA) evaluations of fielded DoD systems<BR>	Support will include information technology tasks related to these areas.  The contract services do not include hardware development.  <BR>	Requirements levied on DOT&E and subordinate organizations will impose relatively demanding conditions of technical rigor, analytical impartiality and soundness, and innovation.  <BR>	The successful contractor will be required to commence work involving access to classified information immediately upon contract award.  Therefore, a DoD SECRET facility clearance is required.  The contractor will be required to receive, generate, and store up to SECRET information at its facility.  Select personnel of the successful offeror who will be performing on this contract must have TOP SECRET personnel security clearance based on a current Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) and be eligible for access to SCI.  The Government will provide a DD Form 254 Contract Security Classification Specification upon issuance of the solicitation.  Foreign participation on this contract is not authorized. <BR>	The purpose of this RFI is to determine interest on the part of offerors in this upcoming Solicitation.  A definitive requirement of this contract is freedom from organizational conflict of interest (OCI).  Offerors will be excluded from consideration who have any involvement in development of DoD systems that are under, or will be under, DOT&E test evaluation oversight as part of its Title 10 responsibilities.  If such a situation occurs, the contractor shall immediately notify the COR of this contract.  Prospective offerors for this contract should be aware that winning this contract can create a situation in which participation in an existing or future DoD systems development contract can cause an OCI that may bring about termination of the DOT&E contract.   <BR>            The successful offeror will be required to have an office located in the Washington, DC metropolitan area within a 30-mile radius of the DOT&E office in the Pentagon.  <BR>	The contract will be a single award fixed labor hour contract for a base year and four option years. This is a follow-on contract to number W91CRB-04-D-0009 with Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) which is anticipated to expire on 30 November 2009.  This acquisition is unrestricted, based on full-and-open-competition.  The NAICS Code is 541690 and the small business size standard is $5.0M.  <BR>	In accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(7), availability of the solicitation, when it is issued, will be limited to the electronic medium.  Hard copies will not be provided.  Upon issuance, the solicitation will be available for download free of charge via the RDECOM homepage at:<BR>		http://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/solicitation_search_form.cfm<BR>At this time, it is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on or about 15 February 2009.   Telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation will not be honored.  <BR><BR><BR>LINKURL: http://__________________________<BR>LINKDESC: U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Centers website and Request<BR>  for Proposals <BR>EMAILADD: Maureen.Sullivan4@us.army.mil<BR><BR>CITE: (W-349 SN5088Q5)<BR><BR>If you believe you have the capabilites for this requirement, please contact Maureen Sullivan at Maureen.Sullivan4@us.army.mil<BR>

<DESC>The results of this RFI are NOT intended to result in the issuance of an RFP or RFQ. Introduction: USAMRAA on behalf of the Department of Defense has developed this Request for Information (RFI) to support the efforts to acquire and implement applications to support Blood Donor Screening and Blood Transfusion Services within the Military Health System (MHS).  This RFI is intended to solicit information from industry on current system capabilities to support the analysis for this project.  The desired outcome of this RFI is information on potential solutions that are available to meet the MHS needs for Blood Donor Screening, Transfusion Services, and data sharing from/to these systems from other MHS IT systems.<BR><BR>The Government does not desire to receive nor will the government review individual corporate marketing materials or slick sheets.  The Government will not review information about products that do not meet the minimum specification listed.  Please see submission procedures listed at the end of this notice.  Contractors supporting the DoD team will review materials submitted in response to this RFI.  The respondents agree upon submission that any material submitted in response to this RFI may be used in part or in whole by the Government as required to support the DoD Blood Management Project.<BR><BR>Background:<BR><BR>In support of the blood program, the major functional activities of the Armed Services Blood Program (ASBP) are marketing, procuring, collecting, testing, processing, freezing, shipping, storing, distributing and transfusing blood and blood components.  To support these activities the DoD maintains 23 Donor Centers and 70 Transfusion Service Centers in peacetime, as well as military/humanitarian contingency operations worldwide.  As a result, a solution that supports the full spectrum from donor registration, and transfusion is required as well as an ability to share appropriate information between individual centers to include the ability to create a look back (i.e., blood product traceability) across all centers and MHS use of the blood management system.  This global repository does not need to be part of individual center or software activity, but any solution must have the ability to share information in standard formats to other MHS IT systems.  To this extent, ASBP is only interested in a single solution, or donor and transfusion services that have been previously integrated so that the government deals with a single vendor.  <BR><BR>Prior to the late 1990s, the DoD Blood Banks (donor centers and transfusion services) used manual processes to comply with required documentation. Patient and test data was transcribed by hand onto labels, logs and result forms; look backs required manual examination of blood transfusion and donor records; patient and donor records were retrieved manually; inventory counting was done manually resulting in over collection and increased number of expired blood units.<BR><BR>In response to the need to automate blood management processes, the Military Health System (MHS) developed an automated information system (AIS) to support the ABBP, the Surgeons General and MHS personnel readiness. The current legacy system, the DBSS, is designated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a Class II Medical Device (510K).  DBSS v3.04 is the AIS currently maintained by the ASBP to manage donor and transfusion workflow.  The legacy system exchanges data with other AISs within the MHS.<BR><BR>Donor eligibility is determined via a standardized screening process as required by the FDA and the AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks).  The ASBP uses a paper form (DD Form 572, Blood Donation Record) to capture the donors health history. A sample of the form can be obtained on request to the Government Point of Contact (POC) listed in the Submission Procedures, below. The health history questionnaire serves as the first step in the collection process for protecting the blood supply and potential donor.<BR><BR>The DD Form 572 has incorporated changes over the years due to the emergence of new diseases and donor eligibility criteria.  The length of the form has been expanded to its maximum capacity with the addition of new questions that need to be captured for the screening process.   The goal is not to maintain the form but to obtain a capability for the MHS that is FDA compliant and meets all current standards of donor/transfusion practice.<BR><BR>A blood donor center staff member must review and interview the potential blood donor upon completion of the questionnaire.  This increases the blood donor centers staff workload and poses a time constraint on the number of donors that can be processed during a given day.  The goal is to process 100 donors over a one hour period.<BR><BR>In an effort to improve the process, the blood community desires to move toward automated self-screening processes.  There is documented evidence from behavioral science literature that automated blood donor screening systems are a great enhancement over manual procedures based on the following: a. Donors are more apt to respond to high-risk behavior questions truthfully; b. Eliciting sensitive behavioral information is less of a burden on blood donor center staff and; c. Automated systems ensure all qualifying requirements are met prior to donation.<BR><BR>The DoD Standard Form (SF) 518 is the blood product request form and patient transfusion record.  A sample of the form can be obtained on request to the Government Point of Contact (POC) listed in the Submission Procedures, below.  The form is used to supplement the current blood management AIS, because the form has not been completely integrated into the Laboratory Information System (LIS) and the hospital Electronic Health Record (EHR).  <BR><BR>In an effort to improve transfusion service efficiency, the documentation of pre-transfusion testing, compatibility testing, and quality control documentation can be recorded within the Blood AIS or LIS.  This enhances blood product utilization monitoring and supports electronic cross match capability.<BR><BR>The MHS needs to maintain compliance with FDA Good Manufacturing Practices in a timely and cost effective manner.  Accordingly, the MHS desires to examine alternatives that will meet Blood Management in the areas of blood donation process management and blood transfusion service management.  The Government will only review projects that are in commercial use and have maintained FDA compliance for at least 7 years. <BR><BR>A graphical system overview can be obtained on request to the Government Point of Contact (POC) listed in the Submission Procedures, below.<BR><BR>Questions/Items:<BR><BR>The Government desires that respondents offer their experience and recommendations on the following questions as well as details the capabilities of specific known system(s):<BR><BR>1.  TECHNICAL SOLUTION: <BR><BR>a.	What IT solutions exist today that meet the needs described and have proven their ability to be used in multiple environments while remaining FDA compliant over at least a 7 year period? <BR> <BR>b.	What aspects of these solutions should the DoD consider as absolute requirements of the future MHS system?<BR><BR>c.	Which solution is most likely to result in a successful Blood Management solution and why? (Specifically describe how this solution will support each of the capabilities.)  If the solution is best of breed, explain how historic integration into a single solution set has been maintained?<BR><BR>d.	Provide overview of the proposed solution from a functional, technical, and clinical perspective.  This view should clearly show how data sharing currently occurs from/to the solution or how it could occur in the future if it does not currently exist.  Be sure to consider the entire system lifecycle.  Also indicate how the solution would support activities which sporadically will have little or no internet connectivity.<BR><BR>e.	How the system is able to incorporate historic electronic data from legacy applications?<BR><BR>f.	How the solutions would support data sharing with organizations outside of the DoD (VA, Managed Care Support Contractors, Civilian counterparts)?<BR> <BR>g.	How would the solution provide for a global database for blood inventory management activities during peacetime, military and humanitarian contingency operations?<BR><BR>h.	How will the solution provide flexibility for emergency operations?<BR><BR>i.	How does the solution document storage conditions?  (Prefer to be able to have the freezers & refrigerators send data directly to the solution.)<BR><BR>j.	How does the solution document training?  Is there an interface with a learning management system (LMS)?   Does the LMS allow users to interrupt a training module and return to same place at a later time?<BR><BR>k.	How does the solution accept manual and automated data entry from laboratory testing equipment?<BR><BR>l.	How does the solution support an automated donor screening (ADS) solution?  Does the ADS process support multiple language capabilities (English, Spanish, spoken versus written languages, etc.)?<BR><BR>m.	How does the solution interface with eDonor system (e.g., an existing self-scheduling solution for Donor Relationship Management)? <BR><BR>n.	How does the proposed solution support the Confidentiality Unit Exclusion process (i.e., maintaining donor confidentiality in the event a donated unit is excluded from transfusion or processing)?<BR><BR>o.	How does the proposed solution support automated lot release functionality?<BR><BR>p.	How does or can the proposed solution support an enterprise-wide or integrated global donor deferral registry?<BR><BR>q.	How does the proposed solution support global donor/patient look back functionality?<BR><BR>r.	How does the proposed solution support ICCBBA (International Council for Commonality in Blood Bank Automation) blood product code updates, International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT)-128 label printing and Codabar linear barcode symbology for product handling?<BR><BR>s.	How does the proposed solution allow for scalability of donor centers and transfusion service centers?  (Anticipate a minimum of 10 workstations per donor center and 5 workstations per transfusion service centers)<BR><BR>2.  BENEFITS:   What are the functional, clinical and technical benefits (both qualitative and quantitative) of the recommended solution relative to the other possible solutions?<BR><BR>3.  TIMELINE:   What is a feasible and realistic implementation timeline for the recommended solution?  Specifically, the focus should be on the initial training and deployment timelines for a single center with the assumption that additional centers/sites would be acquired/deployed sequentially.<BR><BR>4.  COST DRIVERS:   To the degree practicable, please discuss the costs drivers and components associated with the proposed solution?  How do these costs compare to other potential solutions?  Be sure to consider costs across the entire system lifecycle.<BR><BR>5.  RISKS:   What are the most significant risks involved with the recommended solution? How do these risks compare to other alternatives? How will the risks for the proposed solution be mitigated?<BR><BR>6.  GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND MANAGEMENT APPROACH:  What type of governance model and organizational structure would you recommend for this effort?  Consider technical and non-technical aspects and provide examples of comparable joint management efforts. <BR> <BR>7.  ACQUISITION STRATEGY:  What type of acquisition strategy would you recommend for this type of solution? Include pricing strategies in your response.  Please consider the pros and cons of alternative deployment approaches.<BR>  <BR>8.  LESSONS LEARNED:   What lessons learned would you offer to the DoD for planning and implementing a Blood Management solution?  Please note how workflow and integration issues were addressed in projects of similar complexity.  Please identify areas where quick wins can be achieved and areas that will be most difficult. <BR> <BR>9.

Release of Draft RFP - the Government anticipates release of the draft RFP for industry comment in the late January or early February 2009 timeframe.  The draft RFP will be posted on FedBizOpps at https://www.fbo.gov and at the SMDC/ARSTRAT Business Opportunities web page at http://www.smdc.army.mil.  All industry comments pertaining to the draft RFP shall be submitted in writing.  The due date for submission of industry comments pertaining to the draft RFP shall be established at a later date and will be posted with the release of the draft RFP on FedBizOps.<BR><BR>4.  Conduct Second Round of One-on-One Sessions with Industry  the Government intends to conduct a second round of one-on-one sessions with industry after release of the draft RFP and prior to the release of the final RFP.  The Government intends to hold this second round of one-on-one meetings sometime in the mid February 2009 timeframe.  These one-on-one meetings are intended to provide the opportunity for interested contractors to ask questions of the Government and provide any final comments and/or recommendations related to the SMDIS III solicitation and SOW, prior to finalization of the formal RFP.  As with the initial one-on-one industry sessions, these meetings will not be recorded nor published subsequently.  All pertinent recommendations and comments will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the final RFP, with an outline of the changes made from the draft RFP to the final RFP.  Again, these one-on-one sessions will be limited to four one-hour meetings per day and will be scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis.  As additional information becomes available, it will be posted to FedBizOpps at https://www.fbo.gov and at the SMDC/ARSTRAT Business Opportunities web page at http://www.smdc.army.mil/.<BR><BR><BR>The Government requests interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size, business status, anticipated teaming arrangements, and a description of capabilities and similar services offered to the Government or to commercial customers. Include contract magnitude and points of contact (POC) for each example provided (name of the POC, address, e-mail, telephone number, fax number, and the company's web page, if applicable). Please limit your response to not more than 10 single-sided pages. Each submission should include one electronic (virus scanned) copy sent via e-mail to the POCs listed under Original Point of Contact.<BR><BR>As stated above, all information pertaining to the SMDIS III acquisition, related market research activities, milestone schedule and formal solicitation documents will be posted to FedBizOpps as they become available.  No hard copies of the solicitation documents shall be distributed.  Additionally, the Government will include a link within the website to provide an electronic library of historical information relating to the current SMDIS contracts (e.g., a sanitized copy of an existing SMDIS contract and historical task orders).  To the greatest extent possible, this acquisition shall be paperless.  As such, it will be incumbent upon interested parties to periodically monitor FedBiz Opps for updated acquisition information and documents.  Additionally, the Government will include a link on the website for interested parties to register and obtain information pertaining to other interested parties for the purpose of establishing potential teaming arrangements.  Please note that all subsequent synopsis information will be posted to the FedBizOps website at https://www.fbo.gov and at the SMDC/ARSTRAT Business Opportunities web page at http://www.smdc.army.mil.<BR><BR>Points of Contact for the SMDIS III acquisition are as follows, Ruth Schklar, Contract Specialist, (719) 554-8488, Email: Ruth.Schklar@SMDC-CS.army.mil and S.

<DESC><p>FUTURE ELECTRONIC WARFARE CAPABILITIES<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>1. This is a special notice open to U.S. industry requesting information on technologies available in the next decade to provide new or enhanced current electronic warfare (EW) capabilities in order to ensure electromagnetic spectrum control. The Joint Electronic Warfare Center (JEWC) in support of a Joint Requirements Oversight Council task is interested in reviewing the state-of-the-art and emerging technologies applicable to all aspects of EW to include electronic attack, electronic warfare support, and electronic protection. The team seeks specific system solutions with an anticipated technology readiness level (TRL) of 7/8 within the next 8-10 years. To further facilitate communication of DoD's interests and how these potential solutions may address them, a Future EW Capabilities Industry Week will be conducted the week of 8 December 08 in the Washington, DC area. This notice is not to be construed as any type of request for proposal. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subpart 31.205-18, Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>2. The Services, Combatant Commands, Joint Staff, and Office of the Secretary of Defense are currently examining current and proposed programs of record. The intent of the Future EW Capabilities Industry Week is to identify new and game-changing technologies and system upgrades that are not yet incorporated into existing or proposed DoD programs. Additionally, the DoD is interested in next-generation, game-changing technologies that will help shape long-term strategic investments. This is a broad data call that will include all domains (air, land, maritime, space, and cyber) and all warfighting functions (offensive, defensive, battlespace awareness, EW Battle Management, C2, survivability, etc) across all phases of combat. Company responses should clearly indicate the technology area it is addressing and include a one page cover letter, a narrative summary (no more than 3 pages), and briefing slides with the quad chart, as outlined on the website provided below, as the last slide. A Plan of Action and Milestones that describes how the new technology(s) will be matured to TRL 7/8 by 2018 should be included in the brief. During the first day of the Industry Week, the DoD will present further details of the issues/requirements. Subsequently, one-on-one sessions with respondents will be scheduled for the rest of the week. These one-on-one session briefings will be scheduled and presented to a government team that includes members from the JEWC, the Services, Joint Staff, and OSD.</p>
<p>3. Submissions will be considered up to and including TS/SAP/SAR. Specific capabilities of interest and functional/mission area details are available on the following SIPRNET website. Once on the website, select EW FSA tab to view the documents.<br />http://www.jiowc.smil.mil/prohibited/apps/file_bank/myFileExplorer.cfm.</p>
<p>4. Companies are to adhere to the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) procedures for the transmittal of classified responses. Company responses are to include a name and telephone number of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with government representatives. Companies are not limited to a single response. Submissions are due NLT 1 Dec 2008 by 8:00 AM EST and may be made by emailing to the addresses below or by mailing your response on a compact disk and one original and 3 hard copies to:<br /><br />Unclas: FSALeads@jiowc.osis.gov<br />SIPRNET: FSALeads@jiowc.smil.mil<br />JWICS: FSALeads@jiowc.ic.gov</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Director, Joint Electronic Warfare Center<br />Attn: FSA Leads<br />2 Hall Blvd, Suite 217<br />San Antonio, Texas 78243-7074</p>
<p>SAP/SAR submissions are due no later than 20 Nov 2008 by 4:00 PM EST to<br />Col Mark Spillman, OSD SAPCO<br />3200 Defense Pentagon<br />Washington, DC 20301-3200<br />Mark.spillman@osd.mil<br />(703) 697-1282<br />(703) 693-1164 (fax)<br /><br />5. This notice is part of the Government's market research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the "art of the possible" from industry with respect to their current and projected abilities. The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies for EW capabilities. Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. If respondents wish government support contractors to sign a non-disclosure agreement, please include the form in the response. The Government will not use any proprietary information submitted to establish the capability, requirements, approach, or solution so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>6. Only U.S. companies doing business in or based in the U.S. will be permitted to receive the information package or respond to this request. Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly answered and provided equally to all interested parties. Any questions that involve the release of proprietary information (or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a company or that company's possible solution) must be submitted in writing to the technical POC for review and would be answered in general terms as determined by the technical POC at JEWC/EW31.</p>
<p>7. Technical point of contact is Major Paul Harmer, JEWC/EW31, (210) 977-6666, paul.harmer@jiowc.osis.gov.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

Government to exercise the option(s). A written notice of award or acceptance
of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the
time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract
without further action by either party. Before the offer&rsquo;s specified expiration
time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not
there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal
is received before award.</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT
This amendment provides clarification in regard to the difference between the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) Data Coordinating Center (DCC) and BPCA Clinical Trials Network (CTN).

Although the DCC will be collecting, managing, and forwarding all of the study data to FDA, CTN offerors must have an understanding and experience in conducting Phase 1-3 clinical studies.  They will have to ensure that the study is conducted according to the FDA regulations, and the data is generated appropriately, so the DCC will get relevant to submit to FDA for labeling.

Therefore, it is necessary that CTN offerors have actual experience conducting pediatric clinical trials that are performed in accordance with US and EU regulations.  The CTN will conduct the pediatric clinical trials and collects data.  The data is then transferred to the DCC.  The DCC monitors the data.  The cleaned data is analyzed by the CTN with the cooperation of the DCC statistician.  The Clinical Study Report is then submitted by the DCC to FDA.
