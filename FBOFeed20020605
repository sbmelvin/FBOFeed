<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to purchase Data Text Merge (DTM/400) Software from Inventive Designers, 2370 West Highway 89A, Suite 11, Sedona, Arizona, 86336 to support SSA's Modernized Integrated Disability Adjudicative System (MIDAS). MIDAS is a case processing application that is used by various Disability Determination Services (DDS) to process disability claims.  Currently, MIDAS utilizes IBMs Office Vision/400 (OV/400) for data and text merge support in the application.  However, IBM announced that they will no longer support OV/400 as of December 2002.  Without the use of OV/400, the letter creation process (an integral part of the disability adjudication process) would come to a halt in the MIDAS DDSs.  To date, Inventive Designers' DTM/400 is the only known product capable of generating documents that MIDAS programs work with as if they were OV/400 documents without any change to the MIDAS application.

Any Suggested Product Must:

(1) Include conversion software to convert existing OV/400 templates.
(2) Include conversion software to convert existing conditional logic embedded in OV/400 templates.
(3) Not require additional hardware.
(4) Retain ability to use current OV/400 command language in application.
(5) Interface with WORD to create new templates, update existing templates and edit completed documents.
(6) Include OV/400 stop-code functionality.
(7) Utilize standard AS/400 print functionality.
(8) Retain print performance experienced in OV/400 environment and correspondence generation performance within MIDAS. and  
(9) Be commercially available and used in production environments at multiple customer sites.  Software in development or beta-test status is not acceptable.

Vendors capable of satisfying the above requirements are invited to submit information including suggested product literature, company experience, customer references (contact name and phone number), and GSA or commercial prices.  When responding to this announcement, refer to MIDAS SOFTWARE.  Responses must be in writing and must be submitted to the address cited above by SSA's close of business on June 18, 2002.  SSA does not intend to pay for information received and does not intend to re-advertise this procurement.

Pipeline Safety Research and Development, Enhanced Operations, Controls, and Monitoring

DTRS56-02-BAA-0004, due July 8, 2002, POC Warren D. Osterberg, Contracting Officer,  Phone: 202-366-6942, Fax 202-366-7974, Email: warren.osterberg@rspa.dot.gov

CONTRACT INFORMATION: Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) is soliciting information and descriptions (white papers) for cost-shared activities to address research that will complement and enhance pipeline safety.  White papers are not to exceed five pages per project and must include the offeror's contact information: point of contact, telephone number, fax number and email address.  Separate white papers must be submitted for each proposed project and multiple projects cannot be combined into a single white paper.

On April 23 and April 25, 2002, RSPA's Office of Pipeline Safety (RSPA/OPS) held two (2) briefings to provide additional information on the BAA process.  Interested parties may obtain more details on these briefings via the Pipeline Safety Research and Development (R&D) Internet Web site http://primis.rspa.dot.gov/rd/index.htm.  The Internet Web site contains the presentation from the briefings, questions and answers from the briefings, and a list of potential bidders and others who requested that their contact information be made public.  

SPECIAL NOTE:  This announcement will be open through July 8, 2002, unless otherwise amended.  The purpose of the BAA is to solicit research projects to assure the long-term integrity and security of the nation's gas and hazardous liquid pipeline network.  A team of experts will review white papers submitted in response to this announcement and offerors will be advised accordingly, as the evaluation is completed.

SCOPE:  In November 2001, a RSPA/OPS Research & Development workshop brought together government agencies (Federal, State, local and international), research institutions, pipeline companies and their associations, standards organizations, and public representatives to begin development of a national pipeline safety research agenda.  The workshop description, speaker notes, and other documents of interest are on the Internet web site at: http://primis.rspa.dot.gov/rd/index.htm.  On March 28, 2002, RSPA issued the first of three BAAs aimed to address the major research areas highlighted by the November workshop.  The first BAA solicited white papers for Damage Prevention and Leak Detection research and development.  This second BAA solicits white papers for research projects in the second major research areas highlighted by the November 2001 workshop:

Enhanced Operations, Controls, and Monitoring:  Activities should focus on improving technology for operating, controlling, and monitoring the integrity of pipelines.  Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

o	Internal and external monitoring devices, including devices that will detect stress corrosion cracking (SCC)  -Although increasingly understood, SCC presents challenges in its prevention and management/control.  For example, current in-line inspection (ILI) technology yields a high false positive detection rate for SCC.  Examples of topics of interest include better characterization of SCC occurrence and impact patterns, ultrasonic ILI technologies for crack detection, technologies like electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs), internal and external pipeline monitoring devices, and combined acoustic/electromagnetic sensors to locate and gauge SCC. 

o	External corrosion control - Monitoring and maintenance of cathodic protection (CP) systems help mitigate and reduce the spread of pipeline corrosion.  Use of techniques to monitorstray electrical systems resulting from coating anomalies may help identify potential corrosion sites.  Topics of interest include determining the performance of commercially-available coatings under various conditions, improved coatings to impede environmental influences, understanding the seasonal variations in CP effectiveness, and developing models for predicting corrosion wall loss from CP system data.

o	Internal corrosion control - Internal corrosion can be caused by corrosive products or microbes carried in the pipeline.  These inner surfaces can benefit from cathodic protection and induced corrosion control inhibitors, but not from protective coatings.  Topics of interest include environmentally-benign biocides to control microbically-induced corrosion, internal corrosion direct assessment methodologies, technologies to identify the impact of system operating conditions on the onset and growth of corrosion, and technologies to identify corrosion-inducing bacteria.

o	Related risk assessment - Monitoring technologies produce a vast amount of data about the condition and integrity of a pipeline.  Comprehensive analysis of that data and establishing realistic maintenance priorities can help assure cost-effective operation and safety.  Topics of interest include computer programs to analyze risk assessment data, application of standard methods of risk and reliability analysis to pipelines, and techniques to understand the key factors (welds, repair materials, surface loadings, material mechanical properties) that influence the reliability of older pipelines.

o	Human factors - Rotating pipeline controller shifts, human fatigue, and the interaction between operator personnel and pipeline machinery can contribute to pipeline accidents.  Topics of interest include technologies and procedures designed or modified to minimize operator error, the research on the effects of rotating pipeline controller shifts and potential solutions for minimizing those effects, human interface in database management and other portions of the pipeline operating system.

In the next few months, RSPA/OPS will be soliciting white papers for research projects in the remaining research area highlighted by the November 2001 workshop - "Improved Materials Performance."   Research for "Improved Material Performance" will focus on improving pipeline materials to extend the integrity and lifetime of installed pipelines and their various components.  Topics of interest include, but will not be limited to, damage and defect resistant materials, higher grade/strength steel, higher pipe design pressure, welding and joining, composite pipe, and pipe coatings. 

WHITE PAPERS:  RSPA is soliciting white papers on proposed research activities dealing with enhanced pipeline operations, controls, and monitoring.  Each white paper, not to exceed five pages including appendices and backup materials, must include sufficient information to evaluate the following areas:

1.	Cost sharing contributions of at least fifty percent of the proposed project's cost;
2.	Offeror's understanding of the "state of the art" in the research area they are proposing to address;
3.	Demonstration of understanding of the need that the offeror intends to address and quantifiable metrics of how the proposed work will result in improvements over existing technologies;
4.	Technical merit of the approach or concept to successfully address the need;
5.	Time line to implement proposed technologies and concepts into practice in the pipeline industry (one to three years preferable);
6.	Technical experience and capabilities of the offeror in federal research programs;
7.	Feasibility & risk of the proposed work; and
8.	Realism of cost estimate.

All evaluation factors are of equal importance.

GENERAL INFORMATION:  This BAA can be downloaded via the Internet at:  http://www.rspa.dot.gov under Procurement Opportunities.  In all correspondence to the RSPA Office of Contracts and Procurement, please reference the BAA No. DTRS56-02-BAA-0004.

<DESC>Notification of Contract Action (NOCA). This Commerce Business Daily (CBD) announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) for proposed modifications and orders to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) under Contract No. F19628-97-D-0014 increasing the ordering period from 30 June 2002 until 30 June 2003 and the period of performance from 30 September 2002 through 30 September 2003.  This contract vehicle will provide continued Technical, Engineering, Analysis, and Management Support to ESC/SRG under the CIGSS Technical Support (CTS) contract in support of the CIGSS Testbed and DCGS Infrastructure IPT efforts.   ESC/SRK originally had planned to conduct a full and open competition to provide for this support (see NOCA Posted in CBDNet on August 27, 2001), however immediate CIGSS Testbed requirements in support of the Navy's Shared Reconnaissance Pod testing from mid-August 2002 through June 2003 do not allow sufficient time to conduct a full and open competition.  Any interruption in contractor support will significantly affect the success and completion of the test. Since the results of this planned testing will directly impact the feasibility of utilizing the SHARP sensor on US Navy F/A 18 aircraft, any delay or disruption in work would be detrimental to the program. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii)(B),"Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements". In this case the USAF may deem services to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements (see 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B)). This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. An Acquisition Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during proposal development. You should only contact the Ombudsman with issues or problems you cannot satisfactorily resolve with the program manager and/or contracting officer. The Ombudsman role is to hear concerns, issues, and recommendations and communicate these to the appropriate government personnel. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality if desired. The Ombudsman does not evaluate proposals or participate in source selection. ESC's Acquisition Ombudsman is Colonel Joseph P. Maryeski, Director, Commander's Staff, ESC/CO, (781) 377-5106 or email at joseph.maryeski@hanscom.af.mil. Call Kathleen N. Cohen at (781) 377-5584 or email at kathleen.cohen@hanscom.af.mil with questions regarding this notice. See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) Number N68936-00-G-0001 is for Thin-Pack Parachute Systems, subsystem, components, related assemblies and engineering/logistical support with SEI, Asheville, NC.  Order 0013 is for procurement of a quantity of up to 95 E-2C Thin-Pack Parachute Survival Ensemble (PSE) Systems (P/N 3516AS2000-1), PSE Seat Pan Cushion Assemblies (P/N 3516AS2100-1), and PSE Support Pads (P/N 3516AS2400-1) and up to 190 PSE Lapbelt Restraint Assemblies (P/N 3516AS2200-1) and PSE Inertia Reel Strap Assemblies (P/N 3516AS2300-1).  Order 0013 is a continuation of the production line started under Order 0005 under this BOA.  Deliveries to start on Order 0013 October 2002.  Contractor shall deliver 8 systems per month until completion of order.  This requirement is being negotiated on a sole source basis with SEI as the Thin-Pack drawing packages have proprietary markings making design information unreleaseable.  SEI is the only source currently producing the parachute survival ensembles incorporating the Thin-Pack/Lightweight Environmentally Sealed Parachute Assembly (LESPA) technology. The "Thin-Pack" lightweight systems have a 5 1/2 year repack cycle (versus 240-670 days) with a goal of 27.5 years total life (versus 10 years).  No other source has SEI's unique knowledge and expertise in the Thin-Pack technology for E-2C.  The production of the supplies listed requires a substantial initial investment or an extended period of preparation for manufacture.  Proposed order type: Firm Fixed Price.  FOB Origin.    The PSE are to be delivered to Northrup-Grumman, Melbourne, FL for incorporation into the E-2C Aircraft coming off Grumman's production line.  Packing, marking and shipping requirements will be covered by separate order under the BOA.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal or quotation, which will be considered by the Agency.  Interested parties other than SEI must respond in writing (via mail, email, or fax) demonstrating the offeror's experience and capabilities in parachutes incorporating the Thin-Pack technology and the level of maintenance support required by the Government. Address: Commander Code 210000D, NAWCWD, Attn: William T. Monckton, 1 Administration Circle, Bldg. 20259, China Lake, CA 93555-61000.

<DESC>This FedBizOps announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) of a proposed Request for Proposal.  The Global Air Traffic Operations/Mobility Command and Control (GATO/MC2) System Program Office (SPO) will issue an RFP on/about 5 June 2002 on the HERBB.  This requirement is the re-competition of the Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) I,  Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) requirements for the US Air Force. Interested parties should see the Hanscom Air Force Base acquisition web site for additional information (www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil, Current Business Opportunities, Global Air Traffic Management).  This GATM procurement will be for commercial   Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) systems to include all ancillary equipment (e.g., antennas, displays), logistical support and engineering services for multiple Air Force aircraft (fighter, bomber, airlift, tanker, etc.). The Global Air Traffic Operations/Mobility Command and Control (GATO/MC2) System Program Office (SPO) has the mission of supporting the acquisition of CNS/ATM avionics for the Air Force fleet to allow unrestricted access of military aircraft to worldwide airspace. The Global Air Traffic Operations/Mobility Command and Control (GATO/MC2) System Program Office (SPO) mission is to support the acquisition of Communication Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) avionics for the Air Force fleet to allow unrestricted access of military aircraft to worldwide airspace, and to comply with Secretary of Defense-mandated Navigation Safety requirements.  Therefore, the SPO supports procurement of commercial equipment that conforms to appropriate military, civil and industry standards to meet current and future airspace requirements, or equipment that has a defined path to meet those objectives before deliveries of the equipment are scheduled to commence.  ESC/GAT centrally procures GATM equipment, maximizing avionics commonality across platforms.  The individual aircraft platform SPOs integrates the equipment to their aircraft although they must inform ESC/GAT of all interoperability issues that might affect the equipment's certification status. ESC proposes to award up to five multiple award, firm fixed price, commercial,  ID/IQ contracts under Full and Open Competition in accordance with FAR Part 12.  The period of performance for these contracts shall be five years (three year ordering period with two one year options).  The contract minimum for each award shall be $10,000 per contract. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The Government anticipates Request for Proposal on or about 5 June 2002.  This NOCA  does not constitute a Request for Proposal, it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director, program manger, or contracting officer, but to communicate the Offeror's concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concerns.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the selection process.  The Ombudsman is Ms. Bonnie D. Taylor, Director of Contracts, ESC/PK 781-377-2201.  The Ombudsman should only be contacted with issue or problems that have previously been brought to the attention of the program manager and/or contracting officer and could not be satisfactorily resolved at that level. Call Mr. Thomas Leeds at (781) 377-9220 with questions regarding this notice.

Present information in full-color in an easy-to-use and read hand-held "flip-page" format as follows: a. Proportion: The guide shall be relatively small and allow for "mounting" in a prominent classroom location.  Dimensions should be consistent with the contractor's concept for visual aesthetics and rapid identification of individual hazards/responses.  Our desired guide dimension is 5" by 8" however, not larger than 6" x9".  b.  Page Format and Limit: Guide pages shall be attractive and clearly display the page topic.  The guide shall not exceed 50 pages in length.  c. Topic Presentation and Organization.  The guide shall be organized so that: (1) similar contingencies are grouped and recommended response actions to the individual hazards can be easily and quickly located.  (2) Actions are simplistically presented from the teacher's perspective using a series of few words vice complete/complex sentences.  A quick message format such as "bulleting" is desired vice paragraphs.  (3) Actions listed are the most direct towards immediately removing children from harm's way.  "Actions to be taken prompts" should be either sequential or go from "most critical step" to those of a lesser significance.  (4) Actions are appropriate for directing children between the ages of 4 and 18 years.  (5) An index is included for quick reference to desired topic action pages.  d.  Guide Covers.  The front and back covers shall be visually striking so that it attracts attention vice "blends into the background" and allow for wall mounting.  e.  Guide Binding.

Binding shall be sturdy, capable of sustaining rough handling and be replaceable.  f.  Guide Material.  Paper used for the guide shall be of a durable quality capable of sustaining repeated handling-something similar to Xerox Digital Color Durapaper.  Color printing should be considered especially if it adds to the visual recognition of location or steps to be taken.  C.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

Statement of Work

Development of Informational G.R.E.A.T. Program CD-ROM


1.  INTRODUCTION

The Gang Resistance Education And Training (G.R.E.A.T.) Program began in FY-92, through a partnership between the Phoenix, Arizona Police Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.  A nine-lesson middle school curriculum was developed with the goal of reducing gang involvement and youth violence.  

Since then, the G.R.E.A.T. curriculum has expanded to 13 lessons, changed its teaching methodology, and incorporated other program elements such as the G.R.E.A.T. Summer Component, and the G.R.E.A.T. Families Component.  In addition, the G.R.E.A.T. Program has partnered with the Police Athletic League, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and Families and Schools Together.  

The purpose of the G.R.E.A.T. Program is to help children avoid youth violence and gang membership by becoming responsible members of their communities.  This is accomplished by teaching life skills that help children to set goals for themselves, resist negative pressures, learn how to resolve conflicts, and understand how gangs affect the quality of their lives.  G.R.E.A.T. offers students a new philosophical outlook concerning gang activity and the tools needed to resist gang pressure.


2.  PURPOSE/OBJECT

The purpose of this Statement of Work is to elicit proposals to develop a single disk CD-ROM that can be sent to a variety of audiences looking for detailed information regarding the G.R.E.A.T. Program.


3.  ENVIRONMENT

This product is to comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments.  Section 508 requires Federal agencies to ensure that the electronic and information technology products they develop, procure, maintain or use are accessible to persons with disabilities.  Examples of electronic and information products affected by the new standards include computers, software, CD-ROMs, multimedia products, web pages and telecommunication products.

According to Section 508, any training video or multimedia products that contain audio necessary for understanding the content must be open or closed captioned.  Users must be able to turn the captioning on or off (closed captioned), unless captioning is designed to play at all times (open captioned).  In addition, any training video or multimedia product that contains visual information necessary to understand content must contain an audio describing the content.  Users must be able to turn the audio track on or off unless it is designed to play at all times.  Additional information on Section 508 can be found at www.section508.gov.

This product is to be developed to run on both PC windows and Macintosh platforms.  At a minimum, the product must run on a PC with a CPU speed of 200 MHZ, 35 MB RAM, 16xCD-ROM Drive at a resolution of 800x600.  It must also run on a Macintosh computer with the equivalent hardware requirements.  


4.  SCOPE OF WORK

All graphics, scripting, and audio must be appropriate for the audiences listed.

At minimum, the product will provide information on such items as program curriculum and philosophy, instructional methodologies, program implementation, supporting programs, partnerships, history, and funding resources.  The product will also include video and written testimonials from law enforcement officers and administrators, teachers, parents, and students.  

The CD-ROM presentation will be a minimum total of 50 minutes in duration.  This will be the aggregate total of presentations and video for all the various audience types for which the CD-ROM is being created.

Proposal Submission Place:  Ing. Vladislav Raska, First Vice Chairman, Management Department, National Property Fund, Rasinovo nabrezi 42, 128 00 Praha 2, Czech Republic, Tel: 011 420 2 24 991 302, Fax: 011 420 2 24 921 738  :  

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to assist with the remediation of the land contaminated by the Synthesia Chemical plant in the Czech Republic.  

Synthesia is a chemical factory located in Pardubice, in central Czech Republic.  Synthesia has produced chemicals since 1920, and this production has led to chemical contamination of the area.  The Czech Government, recognizing the extent of this environmental liability, agreed to fund the remediation of the land surrounding the Synthesia facility as part of the privatization process.  The National Property Fund (NPF) will provide at least $20 million for the implementation of this project.  The remediation of the land surrounding the Synthesia facilities began in 1994, when factory operations were streamlined and modernized.  These efforts were insufficient and the Czech Government, under the auspices of the NPF, commissioned a team of Czech companies (GEOtest Brno and the Research Institute of Organic Synthesis, collectively referred to as ?GEOtest?) to undertake a feasibility study to identify potential remediation technologies, prioritize remediation locations and develop a conceptual plan for pilot tests of selected technologies.  However, the extent of the environmental damage is much greater than originally estimated.  

The goal of the feasibility study is to work with GEOtest and help prepare this remediation project for implementation.  The U.S. consultants will use the technical analysis provided by GEOtest as a base to plan the bidding specifications for the open international tender for the implementation phase.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $291,400 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),  Economic Assessment Office (EAO) of the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with Delta Research Company for the services of measuring the economic impact of ATP's funding of high-risk, enabling technologies and also to increase understanding of economic relationships underlying technological change and economic growth. To this end, the EAO compiles data, conducts economic studies, and commissions studies by outside research organizations and economists. For the current study, ATP seeks to apply standard, quantitative case-study techniques to the evaluation of a cluster of related ATP projects.  The purposes are 1) to demonstrate the mix of outcomes that must be expected from an investment in high-risk projects in any given area, and 2) to inform the discussion as to whether the combined outcomes of related groups of projects may be more informative to ATP program evaluation than the outcomes of individual "cherry-picked" projects or of a randomly selected projects.  Dr. Pelsoci has the unique knowledge and experience with the technical issues and accomplishments of projects in diverse technical areas, to perform in-depth market analyses, and to apply high standards and creativity in evaluation methodology and execution.  He also exhibited appropriate sensitivities to proprietary concerns of the ATP-funded companies while capturing the critical information needed for the studies.  Dr. Pelsoci's ATP past experience, demonstrated competence and education uniquely qualify him for this work  The current work will expand the state-of-the-art in evaluation techniques, building on competencies Dr. Pelsoci has demonstrated in the past. The current work will involve more scientific complexity and involvement with multiple technologies and projects-and expansion of economic methodologies to multiple projects.  The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order on or about July 14, 2002, under FAR 13.5 Test Program for certain commercial items.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, the government will consider all capability statements received by July 12, 2002.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.

<DESC>Synopsis for Near-field Scanning Optical Microscope (NSOM).  In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) to acquire a Near-field Scanning Optical Microscope from Nanonics Imaging, Ltd., The Manhaat Technology Park, Malcha, Jerusalem, Israel. An NSOM is a computer-controlled optical instrument that measures and maps light emission (or reflection) from a surface under test and operates with a spatial resolution that is shorter than the wavelength of the light sensed.  NIST needs this instrumentation for its new efforts in developing correlated nanoscopic measurement methods for epitaxially-grown films of wide-bandgap semiconductors. Development of the wide-bandgap III-nitride material technology, for applications spanning both solid-state lighting technology and homeland security needs, depends upon developing radically new metrology methods that enable spectroscopic analysis of the following materials on the scale of the defect separation. Materials include alloys of aluminum gallium nitride (A1GaN), indium gallium nitride (InGaN) and compounds that combine both of these alloy materials (also known as the wide-bandgap III nitrides).  NIST requires that the NSOM instrumentation have specialized capabilities such as ultraviolet operation and independent control of optical fiber tips and sample stage motion. It is absolutely essential that the NSOM instrument allow independent motion of the stage assembly that holds the sample under test and the stage assembly that moves the collection fiber tip.  Furthermore, this independent stage motion must be computer controlled with nanometer-scale resolution.   This flexibility in operation will allow essential pump-probe experiments whereby the sample can be moved to various locations relative to a fixed pump beam and the optical fiber probe can then be used to scan and map the spectroscopy of the defects in these fixed locations.  Nanonics is the only known vendor, who has demonstrated NSOM instrumentation that has the following specific features required by NIST:  I. Unique minimum requirements relating to translation of the sample, translation of the NSOM probe tip, sample holders, and fiber tips are:  (i)    Independent piezoelectric scanning ability of sample and probe stages is required.  The separate piezo-drive stage systems, that will support the sample under test and the NSOM optical fiber probe tip, will be independent.  This independent motion will allow for at least 60 micrometers of repeatable transverse scanning (x-y) and least 60 micrometers of repeatable axial (z) scanning of both the sample stage and the NSOM probe tip. (ii)  Coarse sample position adjustment (mechanical, non-piezo) of at least 5 mm (x and y directions) is required.  (iii) At least five separate sample holders that adapt to the NSOM stage assembly.  (iv) At least three NSOM tip mounts for atomic force microscope (AFM) modes of  operation and one mount for a straight tip.   (v)  At least 25 cantilevered fiber near-field imaging probe tips that provide optical transmission down to a UV optical wavelength of 193 nm.  (vi) User manual that includes schematics and block diagrams specific to the instrument.  II.  Unique minimum requirements relating to optical accessibility of optical fiber tip and sample stage assembly are:  (i)  Compatibility with standard microscopes is required.  The tip/sample stage assembly will be designed to allow ready optical access of the sample under test and will be compatible with standard optical microscopes.  In particular the tip/sample stage assembly will be compatible with standard par-focal microscope nose-pieces so that focus and alignment of an inspection microscope can be maintained with the interchange of objectives by rotating the nose-piece of the microscope without the need to change sample alignment.  (ii) The NSOM tip/stage assembly must support either a curved-cantilevered or a straight fiber tip.  In order to enhance optical access from above the sample stage, the option to switch between either a curved-cantilevered or a straight NSOM optical fiber probe tip is necessary.  Here, "curved-cantilevered NSOM optical fiber probe tip" means a tip that can access the sample under test from the side without interfering or blocking the objective of an inspection microscope looking down on the sample from above the stage assembly.  This requirement is stringent since microscope objectives of various magnifications and working-distances will be routinely used.  Here, the typical fiber cantilever length required is 0.4 mm to 1.0 mm and the fiber cantilever height required is 0.05 mm to 1.00 mm.  Furthermore, the vendor must be able to supply NSOM tips, both straight and cantilevered, that provide an optical transmission of least 50%/m at 193 nm wavelength.  (iii) An open aperture of at least 20 mm in diameter is required for optical access to the sample under test.  This accessibility must be possible from both the bottom and the top of the sample.  (iv) Flexibility of the tip/stage assembly to allow ready optical access to a sample from the bottom (opposite side of the sample from that which is scanned by the NSOM tip).   The design of the tip/stage assembly must be sufficiently open in order to allow bulk-optical access by one or more laser beams to the bottom of the sample.  Specifically, the platform assembly supporting the NSOM stage system must allow for at least 20 cm of clearance between the bottom of the support platform and the surface of the optical table.  This acquisition is for a commercial item.  Interested concerns must submit a written qualification statement that clearly establishes the firm's capability to meet the above requirements.  This qualification statement shall be submitted to the individual and office cited above within 15 days from the date this synopsis is posted on the Internet.  This is not a formal solicitation.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Advanced Technology Program (ATP) division intends to enter into a sole source contract with ChI Research, Inc. The project will identify technological "hot spots"?technological areas sparking a concentration of inventive activity over the past two years?and analyze their geographic characteristics, particularly unexpected patterns of hot technological activity occurring off the beaten path, away from easy sources of venture capital, beyond known regions such as Silicon Valley, Route 128, Austin, and Salt Lake City. In identifying technological hot spots, a better understanding of the geographic origins of such inventive hot spots, their geographic concentration, and the extent of localization of knowledge flow within them should result. Identified hot spots will be studied to identify early stage technologies versus late stage technologies to help ATP in its future outreach programs.   CHI Research has the unique knowledge and experience with the development of science and technology citation analysis.  
CHI Research developed the first national-scale bibliometric indicators of scientific performance in the early 1970s, and since then has produced for the congressionally mandated National Science Board's Science and Engineering Indicators reports all the literature-to-literature, patent-to-literature, and patent-to-patent citation indicators. Since 1980s, the company has performed patent citation analyses for corporate competitive intelligence, technology tracing, and other analyses of industrial technology. The company has developed a series of highly unified and unique patent databases.  The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order on about June 14, 2002.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, the government will consider all capability statements received by June 12, 2002.  Award of a purchase order will be processed under FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service will prequalify offerors capable of conducting The Household Diary Study for Postal Fiscal Years 2003, 2004 and 2005, as described in Attachment 01, Statement of Work. Prequalification is a process where a supplier?s ability to meet specific Postal Service requirements is evaluated.  The primary objective of The Household Diary Study is to determine the content of the mail going into and out of households so that informed decisions can be made regarding the mailstream and how it is affected by the Postal Service?s rate structure.  The Study provides a comprehensive description of mail originating and destinating in households and of customer attitudes toward mail.  THIS PROCUREMENT HAS TWO PHASES.  The first phase requires interested suppliers to submit prequalification statements in accordance with the instructions contained in the solicitation.  Prequalification does not constitute a contract award.  It is the business decision of the Contracting Officer to prequalify.  It is the intent of the USPS to award this contract using the prequalified suppliers.  The USPS will review prequalification statements in accordance with the solicitation.  Upon completion of this review, all companies responding to this announcement will be notified of the USPS? decision. Not all qualified suppliers responding to this announcement will necessarily be placed on the prequalified list.  The prequalified list may be limited to suppliers considered most qualified to meet the USPS? requirements or to a small list that will provide adequate competition.  THE DUE DATE FOR SUBMISSION OF PREQUALIFICATION STATEMENTS IS APRIL 1, 2002.  Based on the written prequalification statements, all of the offerors evaluated as prequalified will be contacted to schedule competitive oral presentations of their proposals for accomplishing the work under the contract.  Offerors making oral presentations must submit a price/business proposal no later than April 30, 2002.

<DESC>Description:  Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order for a URC-200 transceiver and accessories to General Dynamics Decision Systems, 8220 E. Roosevelt St (Mail Drop R5216), Scottsdale, AZ  85257.  This equipment will be used to support ACTS deployments.  The 55th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because the URC-200 is currently in use and is the only authorized equipment listed on the mobile package unit type code (UTC) which is determined at the Major Command level.  The introduction of alternate equipment would cause compatibility issues with existing equipment.  Questions should be directed to Mr. Lee Smales in writing via email:  lee.smales@offutt.af.mil or by facsimile:  (402) 232-6571.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure an image/video research services on a sole source basis from Joan Marie Mathys, Washington, DC, for a continuation of existing services for the exhibition on the history of women physicians.  Joan Marie Mathys is an experienced image/video researcher with a strong background in history, American Studies, and technology.  With her bachelors from Marquette University and her masters in American Studies from George Washington University, Ms. Mathys has provided primary research services for the Smithsonian Institution, WGBH (WGBH is a public television station based in Boston), Microsoft, Time Life Books, and for independent exhibition design firms and film producers.  Ms Mathys has been working independently as an image video researcher for the last 10 years.  Prior to that, she had 4 years experience with the Video History Program with the Smithsonian Institution.  She specializes in public domain collections and has worked on documentaries, CD-ROM projects, publications, and exhibitions.  She is experienced at identifying and ordering images from international institutions and conducts research in manuscript and rare book collections.  Because of her skills, experience, and scope of research projects and the variety of clients she has worked on, Ms. Mathys is uniquely qualified to provide image/video research services for the National Library of Medicine and the upcoming exhibition about the history of American women physicians.  She is knowledgeable in the subject area, knows the sources, has a keen eye and strong attention to detail and she is able to step in and create a visual identify through her research for the exhibition about the history of women physicians.  Ms Mathys's continued involvement with this project provides the continuity we require.  She has the depth of knowledge of the subject matter, is familiar with the hundreds of individual biographies, and the intellectual and aesthetic requirements of the project.  Many research leads develop over time and if Ms Mathys is not permitted to follow through on her initial and secondary contacts, the project will lose valuable time reestablishing those contacts.  Because of the breath and scope of the exhibition about the history of American women physicians, it is critical that established research channels be allowed to mature, otherwise, the show will not meet any professional standards and will not remain on schedule.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner, which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information and staffing criteria.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Lead Purchasing Agent, on (301) 496-6127.  Fax requests WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

Of this total, there are four (4) single-story handicap-accessible un its required for this project. The 3 and 4 bedroom non-handicap unit will be two story structures with full basements. The 4 handicapped accessible will be single story with slab-on-grade foundations. Each house unit incorporates a double-car garage, a con crete driveway for additional parking, and covered front porches.  b. Site Work consists of site preparation, supporting utility systems, demolition and site improvements. The external construction includes outdoor recreational facilities, pedestrian walkways, tot-lots, area lighting, landscaping, new roads, parking lots,  exterior lighting, utility extensions for gas, water, sanitary sewer, electrical, communications, paving, walks, curbs, storm drainage, and miscellaneous site improvements. The project will also include demolition of 86 existing housing units, consisting of four-plex and six-plex structures.

<DESC>This notice is for informational purposes only.  This is a notice of intent to negotiate a sole-source purchase with TSI Inc.  This procurement is for a 3080L electrostatic classifier, and associated control software (Aerosol Instrument Manager Software AIM 3936).  The classifier and, Item 2: software will form an integral part of a system for measuring the size of ultra-fine particles, and will be interfaced with an existing modular classifier and mobility analyzer system.  The system will allow reference measurements to be made of aerosol surface area, and will form the basis of developing a portable ultra-fine particle size distribution measurement instrument.  Compatibility with existing equipment is essential for the use to which the classifier will be put.  This necessitates purchasing the classifier from the manufacturer of the existing equipment.  This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $50,000.

<DESC>The following amendment is provided for informational purposes only.  It does not dictate changes to the design specifications or terms and conditions described in the basic solicitation.

1.	For existing tower dimensions, please see Fire Facilities Inc. website: http://www.firefacilities.com/Pages/towers/probie.htm
The WS-2 burn-room is already insulated with ?Westemp? brand insulation.  The existing tower will not be in use during the installation phase.  It will be secured, and available solely for the contractor?s access during installation.  Beneficial occupancy by US Government may be optionally negotiated to mutual advantage after initial installation acceptance. The quoter is responsible for all required building modifications needed to this retrofit. The pressurized ventilation system is a requirement.  Existing Fire-fighter personnel normally onboard Lajes Airfield will be made available to assist, upon your pre-arranged request.  Normal lead-time for same is working days.
2.	Fire places are required in the existing burn-room.  The burn-room is intended to be operated as a stand-alone unit, both with and without the inclusion of various props, at the instructor/operator?s discretion.  The existing Tower will not be in use during the installation phase.  It will be secured and available solely for the contractor?s access during installation.
3.	Local electrical power grid is 50 Hz/220 volt system.  Assume that an existing power panel is within 50 feet (18 meters approximately).
4.	There is no base prop.  All props are optional.  The flashover scenario is intended to occur both with or without an actual fire below it.  The flashover scenario is intended to be both stand-alone, and also in conjunction with a fire in that same burn-room.
5.	The carpet fire scenario is meant to be any typical floor spill that ignites, such as a kitchen-grease spill.
6.	The pressurized ventilation system is a requirement.  The contractor shall determine the most practical pressurized butane fuel system specifications, such that all requisite construction safety codes are met, including NFPA.  NFPA does require that only vapor-phasem (gaseous) butane be present in the interior building piping.
7.	On-site training shall be done in English.  The Regional Government of the Azores (RGA) may provide translators if they so desire.  If so, this will require some patience on the part of the trainer, including speaking more slowly, directly, and having to wait periodically.
8.	All drawings, manuals and documentation are to be done in English language only.
9.	The contractor is to provide adequate lighting as required and of the proper type to render the system fully capable for safe training of firefighting personnel in live, real-time fire scenarios.  Lighting requirements for all spaces in the entire facility, including the burn-room, must meet standard US building codes
10.	Butane tank location and distance shall meet minimum standard US safety regulations.
11.	All US building codes and standards apply, including but not limited to NFPA, NEC, BOCA.
12.	Stainless steels and ASTM-588 weathering steel may be substituted for ASTM A285 boiler plate, only if these are of equal or greater thickness than those already specified.
13.	Standard commercial office and/or residential home carpet fire scenario is intended, with or without props included.
14.	The flashover scenario is intended for any and all prop combinations.
15.	All optional props are required to be used in the burn-room, to maximize all training prop combinations.

NOTE: The solicitation is hereby extended to close Wednesday, 12 June 2002 at 4:00 P.M. EST.

<DESC>This is an Invitation to Pre-Qualify, not a request for proposal (RFP).
The U. S. Postal Service, in anticipation of issuing a solicitation for the rental and laundry services of mops (dust and wet), mats (indoor and outdoor), shop towels, uniforms, and related items (referred hereafter as ?custodial rental items?) on a national basis, is seeking to pre-qualify a limited number of suppliers. As a result of the solicitation, the USPS intends to award a single or multiple national contract(s). Subsequent contracts will require suppliers to provide, pick-up, clean, and deliver a full range of custodial rental items to as many as 28,000 USPS locations within the forty-eight contiguous United States, as well as Alaska, Hawaii and its related islands, Puerto Rico and the U. S. Virgin Islands. The contracts will also require suppliers to design and implement cost reduction processes throughout the supply chain, applying the principles of Supply Chain Management (SCM). The preferred method of doing business will be to utilize electronic data interchange (EDI) through the Postal Service?s internal Web-Based Purchasing System, eBuy. The supplier must provide and maintain a hard copy, as well as an electronic, catalog. Orders placed through eBuy will be passed electronically to the supplier. Invoicing and payment will also be accomplished via EDI, utilizing, a unique, Postal provided, customer delivery address (FEDSTRIP) number. As all Postal buyers do not have Internet access, the supplier will also be required to provide traditional ordering methods including telephone, fax, and mail. Suppliers will be required to submit quarterly reports and to provide and coordinate all customer service training. The contracts will also require suppliers, if not small businesses themselves, to provide a sub-contracting plan that addresses sub-contracting with small, minority and woman-owned businesses. Suppliers seeking placement on the pre-qualified list must demonstrate that they possess the financial, technical, organizational and managerial resources, and have the experience, operational capability, and quality assurance programs necessary to perform a national contract of this size and scope. Only fifty (50) printed copies of the Invitation to Pre-Quality Package are available for mailing. The closing date for the submission of the Invitation to Pre-Quality package will be June 24, 2002. No Invitations will be accepted after this date. All interested parties are encouraged to participate. This is not a request for proposal (RFP).

<DESC>SUBJECT:	ADVANCED MODELING AND SIMULATION TECHNOLOGIES FOR SUPPORTING EXPERIMENTATION, ANALYSIS, ACQUISITION, TRAINING, AND OPERATIONAL APPLICATIONS

POC: 	Dr. S. K.  Numrich, (703) 998-0660
DESC:  The Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) is collecting information for the research and development of Advanced Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Technologies that can enhance the state-of-the-art of experimentation, analysis, acquisition, training and operational applications.  The DMSO is a technology transition and support organization charged with maximizing efficiency and effectiveness of M&S efforts across the Department of Defense (DoD) and to support the reuse of DoD models and simulations.  The DMSO performs those key corporate level functions necessary to encourage cooperation, synergism, and cost-effectiveness among the M&S activities of the DoD Components. The DMSO supports the warfighter by leading a defense-wide team in fostering the interoperability, reuse, and affordability of M&S and the responsive application of these tools to provide revolutionary warfighting capabilities and improve aspects of DoD operations. DMSO is supporting the development of common services and standards that will enable interoperability that includes: 1) availability of authoritative representations of the physical environment (terrain, atmosphere, ocean, space and associated models of natural and artificial objects); 2) weapons and warfighting platforms; 3) human and organizational performance; 4) interoperability of all types of models and simulations among themselves and with other systems (e.g., Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems).   Additionally, common services include knowledge integration technologies and tools for data interchange and Verification, validation, and Accreditation (VV&A) of models and simulations.  Information about these representation objectives and common service can be found on the Web at http://www.dmso.mil. 
The DMSO is seeking information on all technology development efforts that could enhance M&S representations and common services.  Particular topics of interest include: 1) Rapidly adapt the military operational context to M&S systems and procedures (automated composition, data structures, etc.); 2) Develop processes and procedures to generate integrated databases containing time-series physical environment information, computer-aided design files for static and dynamic systems, and human and organizational performance information; 3) Ensure rapidly composable and dynamic simulation environments (multi-resolution, -fidelity); 4) Define specifications to support affordable M&S development and use; 5) Develop threat and force models to produce dynamic, intelligent, thinking, adaptive and credible representations; 6)  Establish data interoperability through the mapping and matching of entity and attribute enumerations; 7) Incorporate multi-discipline characteristics and performance data that can meet faster than real time access requirements to replace current lookup table trade offs in simulation execution; 8) Promote seamless integration of C4I, logistics, and transportation systems with M&S applications; 9) Reduce the need for man-in-the-loop interfaces between simulation and C4I systems; 10) Extend battle space representation to include subsurface and space representations and incorporate new date sources (e.g., hyperspectral, hypersonic); 11) Formalize operational analysis in support of planning, decision support, force structure, chemical / biological effects, and asymmetric warfare; 12) Ensure consistent system representation/behaviors to achieve correlated results across the simulation pyramid (engineering to campaign levels); 13) Describe and share, in a complete and efficient manner, M&S representations and results (meta-languages, logs and reviews); 14) Enable multi-level security across M&S applications; an 15) Provide information and data on Collaborative Engineering Environments (CEE).

Government organizations, commercial companies, universities, and other non-profit organizations capable of conducting appropriate research and development, in whole or in part, are invited to submit an affirmative response to this notice. Interested parties are requested to submit research and development information / ideas; as well as capability statements, catalogs, or their published literature that describes their research and development activities, products and product capability no later than 5 July.  Information submitted shall be limited to two pages and address at a minimum; research, development, and demonstration idea / capability; technical challenge that can be addressed; maturity of the M&S technology; pervious experience with similar efforts; business size, and a point of contact.
