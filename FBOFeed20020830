The anticipated date of award is September 14, 2002.  

SAMHSA's legislative mandate calls for knowledge dissemination and public information, which the publication and dissemination of the newsletter entitled SAMHSA News clearly supports.

To facilitate this mandate, SAMHSA needs a regular vehicle to disseminate information to targeted audiences about new products and services, latest findings, and key developments and announcements in the field and in the agency.

The SAMHSA News newsletter is the one agency vehicle that provides a complete overview of all the Agency's programs and resources to practitioners in different fields; thereby helping to inform and unify the diverse constituencies served by SAMHSA. The Project Officer (PO) for this task order serves as Editor of SAMHSA News.

The primary audience for SAMHSA News consists of substance abuse treatment and prevention professionals, mental health professionals, SAMHSA grantees, and state substance abuse and mental health authorities. The secondary audience includes consumers of treatment services and their families, SAMHSA stakeholder and public interest groups, academicians in relevant disciplines, targeted media, and specialty libraries.

Graphics and visual aids are partners to content in the communication process and are necessary to convey information more readily to readers.  SAMHSA requires graphics, visual
aids, and editorial services to provide this vital component of SAMHSA News.

The Contractor shall provide an aesthetic graphic design and layout for four (4) issues of SAMHSA News, the newsletter of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.  Provide other graphics assistance for SAMHSA News, including
preparation of charts, graphs, and illustrations.  The contractor shall provide photographic assistance for SAMHSA News, including taking photographs, developing and printing film, obtaining release signatures from photo subjects, returning borrowed photos to photo subjects, and maintaining photo files.  Provide proofreading services to assure accurate text in the newsletter layout.  The contractor shall develop an innovative and aesthetic Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)-based format for an online version of SAMHSA News.  Provide two (2) web-ready versions of each issue of SAMHSA News: one in PDF format and the other in HTML format.

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed simplified
acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Stennis Space Center Procurement Office intends to issue a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order to FMC, Corp., Pasadena, TX 77507.= =20 NASA is in the process of fabricating new propulsion grade, 98% Hydrogen Peroxide delivery systems at the Stennis Space Center test facility, Test Stand E3.  The systems will be used to test fully integrated rocket engine systems and rocket engine components such as catalyst beds, pumps and combustion chambers.   The delivery systems are designed for a maximum working pressure of 3500 psi containing standard operating components such as pressure vessels, relief valves, shut-off valves and flow control valves.   The design utilizes gaseous nitrogen as the pressurant to the vessels.  Peroxide delivery systems are being designed for three individual cells each with independent run systems.   In addition to the above design activity, Stennis is also adding the necessary ancillary support systems to the same facility.  These systems include peroxide storage vessels, transfer systems, emergency dump and dilution systems, facility catalyst systems (for burning of residual peroxide), peroxide capture systems (for capturing discharge from a peroxide test article such as a pump), firex systems and a 100,000 gallon concrete containment/disposal "pool".  After the ongoing fabrication, cleaning and passivation of the hydrogen peroxide systems at E3, a conditioning step must be performed. This involves wetting the surfaces for up to 24 hours with a lower concentration of hydrogen peroxide to determine if there is excessive decomposition from the surface as a whole or from particular local spots. This is the last step in activating a High Test Peroxide system before 90% - 98% hydrogen peroxide is loaded into the system.  We are requesting FMC to perform the "conditioning" of the E3 hydrogen peroxide systems when the fabrication and cleaning is complete.	 This is a Commercial Item Acquisition under FAR Part 12.  FMC is the only domestic supplier of 98% hydrogen peroxide and has developed an engineering work force to perform the design and construction of their production facilities.  They also have the technical experience to activate large hydrogen peroxide systems after fabrication and before operational use. FMC's background and experience in handling this type of fluid is unique and unmatched.   This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>NA NOTE:  THIS WAS ORIGINALLY LISTED AS SOLICITATION NUMBER DASW01-02-R-0035. The Defense Contracting Command-Washington (DCCW) Health Affairs Division, on behalf of the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), currently intends to acquire technical, analytical, and database maintenance and management support for a base year plus four opt ions years to update and maintain MIL-STD-1691 database and the CD-RMS. Military Standard 1691, Construction and Material Schedule for Military Medial and Dental Facilities, provides a schedule of equipment for medial and dental facilities.  The information contained in the standard applies to military construction budgets and  is used to identify equipment requirements for construction and renovation planning.  We contemplate this to be a Firm-Fixed-Price contract.

In addition, there is an option for bidding on an additional 47 acres of forestland identified for future thinning.  The estimated 68.5 acres of forestland comprises units 1, 2, and 5. The optional 47 acres of forestland are comprised of units 3 and 4. TIMBER OPERATIONS: This section of the contract covers logging operations on Academy forestlands and includes requirements for felling trees, limbing, bucking, skidding, loading, hauling and brush disposal.  It also includes scarifying, water barring and seeding skid trails and landings.  AREA DESIGNATION:  The contractor shall cut down and remove designated trees in units 1, 2, and 5 as well as optional units 3 and 4 as shown on the Harvest Area Map at Appendix 1.  BOUNDARY AND TREE DESIGNATION:  The boundary of the timber stand to be cut is designated with 3 blue stripes that face into the unit. These boundary trees mark the outer edges of the project area and will not be cut down or damaged in any way. Trees within the boundary of ?leave? tree units 1, 2, 3 and 5 that are designated to be cut and removed are those trees that DO NOT have a blue paint stripe at around 4.5 feet up on the bole and a blue dot on the stump. All blue marked trees are ?leave? trees and will not be cut or damaged in any way. Trees to be cut include all unmarked and unmerchantable conifer trees in the under story as well.  Trees within ?cut? tree unit 4 are those trees that are marked with orange paint at 4.5 feet up on the bole of the tree and a dot on the stump.  See attached Harvest Area Map for paint designation. Mountain mahogany is a protected plant and will not be cut or damaged unnecessarily in any unit.  SKID TRAILS AND LANDINGS:  Unless otherwise stated by the contract administrator, all required skid trails and landings will be approved by the administrator prior to skidding and decking.   PRODUCT REMOVAL:  All portions of felled trees that are 3? or greater in diameter outside bark shall be removed from the sale area.  This includes all portions of limbs that are greater than 3?.  Wood products shall be removed in any form that is convenient and economical to the contractor as long as all wood 3? or greater is removed from the Academy.  SCARIFYING, WATER BARRING AND SEEDING:  Upon completion of each unit, skid trails will be water-barred where flagged by the administrator. Also, all skid trails, landing and haul roads will be scarified and seeded with the Academy approved native seed blend. The seed for this revegetation work WILL BE PROVIDED by the Academy.  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS: the contractor prior to starting work shall submit an operating plan.  The plan shall include a starting date and an estimated completion date.  Work shall begin in a designated area of the unit. All work shall be done to specifications in this document and shall progress in an orderly manner until the project is competed.  Each unit shall be completed and all contract requirements approved by the sale administrator prior to beginning work in the next unit.

Slash shall be disposed of, depending on the location, as directed by the Natural Resources representative and shown on the harvest area map, as follows:  PILING:  Slash shall be hand piled or machine piled using a bulldozer equipped with a brush blade.  Slash piles shall be located so that when they are ignited, residual trees will not be scorched or damaged by heat.  Piles shall not exceed 8 feet in height and shall be kept smaller in areas of heavy residual.  Dirt shall be kept to an absolute minimum within all piles. 100% slash piling is required in units 1, 2, 3 and 4. Slash will be piled in approximately 70% of Unit 5. In the other 30%, slash can be lopped and scattered due to steepness of the terrain.  An acceptable option to piling is chipping and hauling slash off base.   LOP AND SCATTER:  Slash shall be lopped and scattered so that it lies no higher than 12 inches above the ground. Trees shall be limbed to the tip and branches shall be cut so the length is 3? or less.  Slash shall be treated on a daily basis, concurrently with felling operations. Lop and scatter will be allowed in Unit # 5 on all areas where the slope of the land is greater than 20%. All other areas should be piled or chipped and hauled off base.  DAMAGE PENALTY:  All work required under this contract shall be conducted in an orderly, professional, and workmanlike manner.  All necessary precautions shall be taken to protect the residual forest, streams, and surrounding natural resources.  A fine of $75 shall be assessed for each residual tree that is excessively damaged by the contractor?s operation.  PRODUCT OWNERSHIP:  All forest products shall remain the property of the U.S. Government until the products are removed from the Academy; i.e., until the product is actually hauled through either the north or south gate.  STUMPAGE:  The contractor shall pay stumpage rates for all merchantable wood products removed from the project area.  Merchantable forest products are all portions of the cut tree that have merchantable value as determined by the Academy Forester.  This includes, but may not be limited to saw logs, wood chips and firewood.  Sawlogs are all logs that are at least 6? in diameter inside bark at the small end and 8? long or longer with 33% or less defect due to rot, crook, sweep, or other factors.  The payment schedule for merchantable material on a per unit basis at a rate of $10.00 per cord will be determined prior to removal of the product from the base.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with format in the FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This request for quotation number is FHQ02R00800.  The Department of the Treasury, Financial Management Service, 401 14th Street, SW, Washington, DC  20227 intends to award a sole-source purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures and provisions and clauses for Commercial Items.  The award will be made to Weiland Financial Group, Inc. for the merging, creating, and updating of the FMS banking database using installed banking software.  The contractor will provide a follow-on 2-day training session. The contractor shall:

1) Merge specified FMS banking information into one all encompassing database accessible through the FMS universal LAN using the current supporting software.  The information held within the database would be backed up as often as our network is backed up to limit the risk of losing bank databases due to a client PC crash; 

2) Add two non-existent banks to the newly created database.   All of the accounts and services for each of the relationships would be added to the database and setup according to their bank specific settings held within the system.  All statements for each of the banks would then be balanced against what BRM has calculated for each of the banks.  Discrepancies would be noted and pointed out to FMS at project completion; 

3) Update specific banking services with the correct pricing supplied to contractor by FMS in an Excel format with the following fields: Bank Service ID, Bank Service Description, Unit Price, and Expected as of Date.  Once the update is complete the contractor would then align all of the services to the new service pricing.  This would only be necessary if the service pricing entered needs to be applied to historical data.  The contractor handles will map all services at all banks with the same standard service codes in mind.  This ensures that service "x" at Bank A is mapped to the same code that service "x" at Bank B is mapped; 

4) The contractor will provide the FMS Treasury Department with a two-day On-site training session to insure that the FMS employees have the knowledge necessary to keep the newly created database running smoothly and without error once the project is turned over to FMS.

Vendors interested in submitting quotes must submit pricing and technical data by 1:00 p.m. September 9, 2002.  Please price the required items individually in the price proposal.  FAR 52-212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial applies to this acquisition; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items is hereby incorporated by reference.  The Government will award a purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures to the responsible offeror whose offer is most advantageous to the Government.  The offers will be evaluated on the basis of the best value to the Government, based on both technical and price proposals.  FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items applies to this acquisition and shall be completed and submitted with proposal.   The clauses may be viewed at http://www.arnet.gov/far.  Responses must be in writing and must be received within five (5) working days of publication of this notice.  Responses must include Representations and Certifications.

<SUBJECT>58--Invitation for Industry Comments to Draft Enhanced Tactical Satellite Signal Processor (ETSSP) Specification
<SOLNBR>MARKET RESEARCH 0002
<RESPDATE>091802
<ARCHDATE>11172002
<CONTACT>Terry Traino, (732) 532-8867
<DESC>NA This request is for Industry to provide comments on a draft specification  prepared for use in an upcoming solicitation for a replacement to the Tactical Satellite Signal Processor (TSSP), TD-1337 (V) 1 and (V) 2 second level multiplexers that are currentl y in use with existing Ground Mobile Forces (GMF) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) terminals.  The ARMY uses V1 & V2; V1 is in the AN/TSC-85B/C; V2 is in the AN/TSC-93B/C.   The TSSP is used to combine signals, which have been previously multiplexed by va rious first level multiplexers such as the Promina, FCC-100, IDNX, ISDN Transport Multiplexer or other user equipment (Switches; AN/TTC-39E, COTS ATMs).  A complete text of the draft specification can be found at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil under U.S.Ar my Market Research Listings.  The new satellite signal processor will be a communications enhancement project called the Enhanced Tactical Satellite Signal Processor (ETSSP) that will provide deployed users with enhanced capabilities for the current second  level multiplexing bandwidth and circuit flexibility while using Army GMF SATCOM terminals.  The ETSSP's primary purpose will be to increase data carrying capacity to acceptable levels to meet current deployed users communications requirements.  The ETSS P will also include enhanced data rate and interface capabilities as well as accommodate ETSSP digital frame structure in accordance with (IAW) Mil-Std-188-168 that is going to be approved in the near future, late September 2002 or early October 2002.  The  ETSSP will be integrated with the GMF SATCOM terminals and replace the legacy TSSP that is a microprocessor controlled synchronous Time Division Multiplexer/de-multiplexer.  Both the ETSSP and legacy TSSP's function is to multiplex digital input signals i nto one composite data stream for transmission and to de-multiplex one or more composite data streams into individual data streams.  The ETSSP will be a mechanically drop and insert replacement for the legacy TD-1337 (V) 1 and (V) 2 second level multiplexe rs that are currently in use with existing GMF SATCOM terminals.  Only one version of the ETSSP will be used, regardless of which GMF terminal it is used.  It will mount in the space occupied by the legacy TSSP and will be integrated with both power and si gnaling.  The ETSSP will provide, both, backward compatibility with legacy GMF terminals, as well as compatibility with future (near term) upgrades in strategic reach-back and new tactical SATCOM terminals.  The ETSSP will use state-of-the-art miniaturizat ion and integration techniques.  It will occupy a rack-unit of seven standard rack units or less (RU=1.75 inch high per RU).  The legacy TSSP occupied approximately 7RU of rack space), approximately 19inches wide or less and 17-19 inches deep (includes bac k connectors and power cords).  This will enable the ETSSP to function with existing modems.  The ETSSP equipment will employ an open architecture, which will allow functional components from multiple vendors to be added in the future without proprietary c onstraints.  The ETSSP will consist of the necessary hardware and software to perform all system/network management and control functions related to the ETSSP multiplexing, test and system timing functions. The desired ETSSP would be an item thats commerc ially available or an item thats commercially available, but cost effectively modified to meet the specification. For those interested in impending contractual effort, please be aware that the ETSSP Statement of Work (SOW) will include some of the followi ng requirements:  a.  Delivery of eight (8) pre-production samples by Jun 03;  b.  Ability to handle a production schedule delivery of 8-10 units per month commencing during 2QFY04;    c.  Provide a minimum of a 30-month warranty, with 24 hour CONUS (Conti nental United States) and 48 hour OCONUS (Overseas Continental United States)) turn-around time for the user;  d.  Have the ability to furnish commercial manual s for operator use and repair information for the anticipated time when the ETSSP is beyond warranty coverage;  and e.  Request comments (to the draft specification) by close of business (COB) 18 Sep 02.  POC, Mr. Dwight A. DeButts, dwight.debutts@mail1mon mouth.army.mil (732) 532-9530.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institues (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Populations Sciences (DCCPS) proposes to contract with Deborah Schrag, M.D. of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021 for the services herein.  The DCCPS objective is to study the role of hospital and physician procedure's volume as well as physician specialty in ovarian cancer morbidity and survival.  Ovarian cancer is the 5th most frequently diagnosed cancer in women with an overall 5-year relative survival rate of about 53%.  Findings may be used to identify issues related to the quality of ovarian cancer care that will be studied by the NCI and improve patterns of referral of women with ovarian cancer.  Studies have demonstrated that patients treated in hospitals that perform high volume of procedures have better outcomes than similar patients treated in hospitals that perform these procedures less frequently.  The work of this project will utilize SEER-Medicare claims data to assess the role of hospital and physician procedure volume as well as physician specialty on ovarian cancer morbidity and survival.  Because differences in recommended treatement vary by state of disease at diagnosis, analyses will be stratified by stage.  Dr. Schrag is a nationally recognized expert in the use of SEER-Medicare claims data to explore treatment outcomes.  Dr. Schrag led a project to explore the role of hospital procedure volume on colon cancer outcomes and has been involved in other studies to explore the role of hospital and physician procedure volume on prostate cancer outcomes using the SEER-Medicare data. Dr. Schrag has more than 20 research publications on studies using SEER-Medicare claims data, as well as the principal investigator of a colorecteal cancer simulation model where she will use analyses of Medicare-SEER claims data as an input to the model.  Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center along with Deborah Schrag, M.D., M.P.H. is the only known source to the government with the unique skills and depth of knowledge of the use of SEER-Medicare data, in particular with hospital procedure volume and cancer outcomes.  However, if any interested party believes it too can meet the above, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain mateiral in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the Government needs.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office no later than September 17, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The requirement will be procured as a non-commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 13.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Govenrment not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. NAICS Code: 541990 and the business size standard is $6.0 Million.

The ATC facility is responsible for supplying arrays for the entrie NCI and many collaborators. The OmniGrid 300 instrument is a high-capacity, multi-axis microarrayer that prints biological samples onto various substrates with speeds resulting in ultra high-throughput array production.  The OmniGrid 300 special features include: 1) three high-performance, industrial grade linear stages and servomotors; 2) the printing platform is capable of holding 300 standard (1" x 3" or 25mm x 75mm) microscope slides arranged into easy-load slide holders; 3) the wash station relies on sonication and vacuum drying to thoroughly clean the printing pins in a automated fashion; 4)the print head holds up to 48 pins.  The ATC has acquired previous systems with lower capacities, the procurement of a more advanced system will ensure that downtime in array production will be at a minimum as well as compatibility requirements.  The OmniGrid 300 Microarraying Robot is the only system known to the government that is compatible with existing Omnigrid units and provide the above features.  This is not a request for competitive quotations, however if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a capability statement.  This statement must demonstrate that an alternate system provided will be equivalent in quality, function and compatibility. The statement and any other supporting documentation must be furnished in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party meets the requirement.

The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 421450 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  The Laboratory of Cell Biology (LCB) requires a Tiltrotation Gatan Cryotransfer System for the preparation of frozen hydrated specimens to be examined by  the Government owned  Tecnai 12 and Tecnai F30 electron microscopes.  The Tiltrotation system will extend the FEI Tecnai 12's capability for 1) structural determination of membrane proteins and complexes at atomic resolution and 2) structural determination of macromolecular assemblies from single particle imaging studies and; 3) study of large sub cellular assemblies usign electron tomography..  The Gatan Single Tiltrotation Cryotransfer System enables frozen suspensions to be loaded into a TEM holder and transferred frost-free at temperatures <-150C to the TEM. The Cryotransfer System comprises a tilt-rotation, liquid nitrogen cooled specimen holder and tools for the frost-free transfer of grids from the workstation to the holder. The control unit allows the specimen temperature to be measured and varied to generate the cryopump in the liquid nitrogen dewar. Nitrogen cooled cryoholders are cryopumped by a zeolite trap and have a built-in heater to regenerate the zeolite. This system is completely integrated with the Tecnai 12 and Tecnai 30 electron microscopes. Thus the NCI user can rely upon increased efficiency in more complex analyses.  Gatan, Inc. is the only source known by the NCI that can provide such a holder with the required features of tiltrotation at cryogenic temperatures.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Prevention Studies Branch (CPSB) plans to procure blood and esophagectomy specimens from Tenwek Hospital, Post Office Box 39, Bomet, Kenya.  The supplies and services herein are non-commercial as defined in FAR Part 13 and are being procured in accordance with simplified procedures.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 422210 and the business size standard is 100 employees. The CPSB conducts intramural research in the areas of genetics and cancer, nutrition and cancer, cancer chemoprevention, and other cancer prevention strategies aimed at lowering human cancer risk.  Esophageal cancer, one of the 10 leading causes of cancer death worldwide, is one focus of CPSB research. The CPSB studies early detection and early intervention techniques for esophageal cancer.  To further our goal, NCI is conducting comparative studies of populations at high risk for esophageal cancer.  One such population resides in the western part of Kenya in Bomet District.  NCI needs to obtain serum and DNA samples from both esophageal cancer cases and  healthy individuals who reside in this high risk region.  In addition we require blood and esophageal tissue from tumor and non-tumor portions of esophagectomy specimens for genetic and other analyses.  CPSB, plans to use an ecologic study of the frequency of genetic polymorphisms between populations at different risks for esophageal cancer to aid our understanding of the genetic contribution to risk of this rapidly fatal disease. The purpose of this procurement is to collect blood samples from 100 individuals from each of five different ethnic backgrounds and different risks of esophageal cancer that reside in Bomet District Kenya.  A total of 500 blood samples will be collected.  Also, we will collect blood and tumor and non-tumor esophageal tissue from up to 100 esophageal cancer cases. Contractor Requirements: 1) contractor shall collect 500 blood samples from blood banks and separate these into serum and cell fractions.  100 samples will be collected from each of 5 different tribal groups, 2) samples shall be collected, anonymized, stored appropriately and delivered to the NCI and, 3) blood and esophageal tissue shall be collected from consenting individuals who have undergone esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.  Serum, blood cells, and tumor and non-tumor portions of the resected esophageal tissue from esophageal cancer cases shall be collected, anonymized, stored appropriately and delivered to the NCI. Period of Performance: Blood samples: Upon award of purchase order through six months. Esophagectomy samples: upon award of purchase order through 12 months with one option year.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (November 1999) and FAR Clause 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Terms of the Contract (March 2000) applies to this order.  Tenwek Hospital is the only known source to the NCI that has Access to Bomet District in Kenya. Tenwek Hospital is a comprehensive health care facility located in this area.  Tenwek Hospital is  the only place in Western Kenya that provides this specialized treatment and they are therefore the only potential source of esophageal tumor tissue from this region.  There location also allows them to collect blood from all 5 tribal groups of interest. This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541330   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to enter into a sole-source contract with Mitretek Systems, Inc., to initiate the preparation of a state-of-the-art review of existing and developmental technologies for the protection of buildings in the event of a terrorist attack using chemical or biological gases or aerosols.  This review will be used by EPA to assist the Agency in planning its Homeland Security/Safe Buildings Program.  As part of this study, available classified and unclassified documents will be reviewed to determine the availability,  technical maturity, and remaining data gaps, of technologies for:  detection of the chemical and biological agents; containment of the agents in a limited section of the building, immediately after release; decontamination of the building following the attack; disposal of contaminated building  materials and furnishings; and risk communication.  An analysis of the technologies thus identified will be conducted, to assess their strengths and limitations and their remaining R&D requirements, as well as appropriate technology transfer approaches for making these technologies effectively  available to EPA's clients.  The contract will be awarded on a noncompetitive basis for the following reasons: (1)  Because much of the pertinent on-going chem/bio research is being conducted in the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy ? and because it is often described in classified  documents, even though the portions of interest to EPA may be unclassified ? the contractor conducting this work must have an established working relationship with the pertinent agencies within DoD and DOE, familiarity with the specific individuals involved from these agencies, and experience in  locating key classified reports within those agencies that might not explicitly appear in computer data bases. (2)  Because this Program is high-visibility and must be initiated and completed within a very short time period, the contractor must also have senior personnel with many years of  experience in the areas of interest to EPA.  This experience is required, not only so that the contractor will have the contacts, familiarity, and knowledge to promptly locate the necessary reports, but also so that the contractor will then be in a strong position to rapidly analyze the state of  the technology and authoritatively identify the residual data gaps and R&D/tech transfer needs. (3)  Because the results of this state-of-the-art review will be used by EPA to help us plan the Safe Buildings Program, it is crucial that the contractor not have a bias or conflict of interest.   Accordingly, the contractor must be either a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), or a not-for-profit organization whose charter and policy precludes it from bidding on Federally sponsored procurement actions.  Organizations that feel they have the qualifications to meet EPA's  requirements must submit documentation to support.  Interested parties that feel they can met EPA's requirements must respond to this requirement by providing written documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.   A determination not to compete the  proposed  requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information  received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. This acquisition is being processed  under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Interested parties should submit  documentation in writing to Mike Hennessey using the following methods: (1) by fax to 513.487.2109, or (2.) by email (hennessey.mike@epa.gov) referencing solicitation  OH-02-259.

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Technical Assistance for the Pacific Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project in Bolivia.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide the Government of Bolivia with Technical Assistance for the Pacific LNG project, a priority project for Bolivia that will be the primary vehicle to monetize proven hydrocarbon reserves in the Margarita Field in southern Bolivia.  

The Margarita Field contains over 6 Trillion Cubic Feet (TCF) of proved natural gas reserves and over 140 MMBbls of condensate.  In its development and based upon preliminary studies and analyses, the Pacific LNG project has deemed the most economical way to monetize the gas reserves is to build and transport hydrocarbons via a 42? natural gas pipeline and an 18? liquids pipeline to a port location in northern Chile or southern Peru.  The 850 MMcfd of expected pipeline volume will be converted into LNG at the port location and then shipped to a greenfield gasification facility in northern Baja California, Mexico where it will be sold into Mexican and California markets.

The Bolivian natural gas sector has changed significantly since the 1996 privatization of YPFB, the state owned oil and gas company.  During the past 5 years, a heightened exploration investment pace by foreign oil and gas companies has led to a significant increase in the country?s proven and probable natural gas reserve base from over 6 TCF to 52.3 TCF.  As the Southern Cone gas market is limited in its ability to absorb gas production from such a large reserve base, foreign markets are being considered for gas exports in the form of LNG.  Therefore, the proposed Pacific LNG project has targeted the California and Mexican gas markets for LNG exports.

Bolivia?s increased discovery of natural gas reserves has provided an abundant natural resource for which the country must derive benefits; the government has stated their intention to fully capture the hydrocarbon potential that exists within their borders.  Attracting and retaining investment for the development of the many possible projects is key to the country?s economic growth and is a priority.  The proposed TDA-funded Technical Assistance will provide the Bolivian government with an important, independent assessment of the largest specific project aimed at monetization of their natural gas reserves and will assist the government in finalizing in an expeditious manner the requirements and terms for the project.  The Technical Assistance will include the following components:

?	Technical Analysis
?	Economic Analysis
?	Financial Analysis
?	Environmental Analysis
?	Regulatory Review
?	Proposed Equipment and Services
?	Implementation Plan
?	Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $386,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in Spanish and English directly to the Grantee by 5:00 p.m., SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>In this Request for Information, TSA is seeking information from industry with regard to commercial practices for uniform design, manufacture, and distribution, to use in developing an acquisition strategy for a potential new uniform requirement.  By October 2003, TSA is tentatively planning to implement a new, permanent uniform program for all federal passenger and baggage screeners.  Part of this permanent uniform program will be to review uniform design/style options in order to develop a unique TSA uniform design.  After a design is developed, all (approximately) 52,000 screeners will need an entire uniform set, which TSA anticipates will require an initial fitting.  After all TSA screeners have received their initial uniform set, this surge in uniform requirements is expected to decrease to a maintenance/replacement level of uniform need.  Given all the elements in this potential requirement, uniform design, fitting sessions, uniform manufacturing, uniform distribution, and uniform program maintenance, TSA would like industry input with regard to the best way to structure this uniform procurement and program.  In developing an acquisition strategy for this potential procurement, TSA is interested in feedback on the following:  1.  including small businesses in the program, including veteran and disabled veteran owned businesses, agencies employing people who are blind or severely disabled (JWOD), and the potential for a mentor-prot?g?e program.  2.  the value of conducting fitting sessions versus having employees place remote orders using size information.  3.  the value/impact of conducting this procurement either as a single procurement or multiple procurements.  4.  suggestions on how to improve the following Statement of Objectives.  5.  suggestions for ensuring a secure design, manufacturing, and distribution process for unique TSA items.  6.  suggestions/information regarding industry practices for testing garment performance, including the commercial standards used.  7.  information regarding the duration of similar business arrangements in a commercial environment.  8.  any other suggestions/information, which may be helpful in developing the procurement strategy for the uniform program.  Following is a general description of TSAs future potential uniform requirement.               

TSAs design objective is to develop a comprehensive and integrated direction for uniforms that communicates the Transportation Security Administration?s positioning of secure modes of transportation without inconvenience.  Uniforms should evoke a style that is crisp, garners respect, and motivates pride to work for TSA.  It should be distinctive, professional and hip, yet grounded in a traditional style.  It should also reflect the local geographic area but not create more than five options. The uniform should be also be considerate of employee?s cultural requirements.

TSAs desired design takeaway/outcomes:  1.  A status uniform that communicates distinctiveness.  2.  Sophisticated, yet young-at-heart and current (Personality)  3.  A uniform that is inclusive, comfortable, and practical.  NOT trendy, exclusive, cold. (Tonality)  4.  A uniform that is grounded in the classics but contemporized with charisma and importance. (Style)

TSA desired design considerations.  The design should:  1.  reflect an organization that is customer savvy and responsive, yet delivers a sense of confidence.   2.  suggest a four-five star hospitality image grounded in traditional security appearance.  3.  create a sense of place that is secure, comfortable, and expedient.  4.  look bold, passionate, current, hip and not timid.  5.  reinforce traveler trust and confidence.  6.  reflect regional expressions, yet invoke a sense of national uniformity.

As part of this effort, the resulting design should consider the following environmental/usage elements:  1.  climate variations among airports.  2.  passenger/baggage screeners will be working interchangeably.  3.  differences in working conditions of passenger screeners versus baggage screeners.  4.  the design must be manufacturable on a mass scale in order to control costs.  5.  the necessity for maternity uniforms.

The uniform design will also include the following:  1.  fabric recommendations.    2.  pattern specifications, sewing/stitching specifications, button specifications, and any other specifications/instructions/guidance necessary for constructing the uniform as submitted in the design.     

After a uniform design is established, TSA requires a business partner who is a SERVICE PROVIDER rather than simply a MANUFACTURER or a DISTRIBUTOR to run our uniform program. 

The business partner shall be responsible for:  1.  developing a technical approach that will accommodate the Governments initial surge need for uniform sets, then settle into a maintenance/replacement level of uniform need with no disruption in program operation or service.  2.  manufacturing and/or acquiring all uniform items required.  3.  providing all uniform items for TSA passenger and baggage screeners, including belts, socks and shoes, and any other accessories.  4.  providing inventory control and management, warehousing and tracking of all inventories either manufactured or acquired to ensure secure storage and timely deliveries of all uniform items.  5.  establishing a secure distribution process, including shipping, handling, and delivery to all airport locations.  6.  working with TSA to provide employees with a secure web site inclusive of a web based catalog, price list, order form, and customer comment/feedback card.  7.  providing an ordering process to effectively manage changes to current and existing uniform items.  8.  implementing a made to measure program for employees that are hard to fit.  9.  effectively balancing/managing inventories with customer demand.  10.  effectively assuring quality control in the manufacturing process.  

Interested parties are requested to submit input/suggestions in writing using NO MORE THAN FIVE (5) pages.  Interested parties may also submit capability statements using NO MORE THAN TWO (2) pages.  Please DO NOT SUBMIT MORE THAN SEVEN (7) pages in response to this request for information.  Input may be submitted by mail to the Contracting Address, via e-mail, or by fax.
Respondents are advised that the purpose of this Request for Information is to conduct market research in order to develop an acquisition strategy for a performance based uniform system for TSA.  Accordingly, no funding is currently associated with this proposed contract action, and no award will be made as a result of this Request for Information.  The Government reserves the right to consider all, some, or none of the input received as a result of this Request for Information.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Questions and Responses

1st Round of Questions and Responses to RFP (NAMA-02-R-0009) 



Question #1: Where will the required work site be located?  
Will there be an RFP released or is the combined Solicitation 
that was posted the only document interested parties should respond to?

Response:  Although the Statement of Work states that the work will be performed at the contractor's site, NARA prefers the work be conducted at its facilities in Archives II, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, Maryland 20740.  In addition to the information 
on the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, a Statement of Work is available and will be provided upon request. If you are interested in obtaining a copy of the Statement of Work, please 
contact Latoshia Madden at latoshia.madden@nara.gov.

Question #2: I meant to ask you if there was any potential of an extension on the response date. 

Response:  The response date and time is September 4, 2002 at 4pm EST.  There will be no extensions.

Question #3: Is this solicitation online in more detail?  

Response:  In addition to the information on the Combined synopsis/Solicitation, a Statement of Work is available and will be provided upon request.  If you are interested in obtaining a copy of the Statement of Work, please contact Latoshia Madden at latoshia.madden@nara.gov and gruderman@nara.gov.

Question #4: Can you tell me if there is an 8(a) set aside for this procurement? 

Response:  An 8(a) has not been "set aside" for this procurement.  This procurement is open to all vendors.

Question #5: In regards to the solicitation, I noticed that "NARA intends to award a contract to purchase FileNet's (or equal) Web Content Management System."  Are there any other file systems that NARA has in mind that it would be willing to purchase (i.e. Oracle Portal, Microsoft's Content Management System, etc)?

Response:  NARA has not decided upon a specific file system but would like to purchase one with the functionality 
similar to FileNet's Web Content Management and with the functional and technical specifications described in our 
Combined Synopsis/Solicitation.

Question #6: I know that this is not a set-aside, but would NARA look favorably on using a small business as a 
contractor?

Response: NARA's procurement of a Web Content Management System is open to all vendors.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is seeking statements from Offerors who have the capability to test approximately 15 chemicals per year for ten years for somatic genetic effects in rats and or/mice.  Assays to be performed will include Task 1: Chromosomal aberration in various animal tissue; Task 2: Micronuclei in bone marrow, micronuclei in other tissues (e.g. lung, spleen, peripheral lymphocytes) and micronuclei in peripheral erythrocytes from sub-chronic studies; Task 3: Centromeric probe analysis of micronuclei; Task 4: Single cell gel electrophoresis assays of various tissues; and Task 5: Analysis of genetic toxicity information.  The Offeror shall develop protocols for Tasks 1 to 4.  All work for Tasks 1 to 4, including any subcontracted work, shall be performed at the offeror's site in order to minimize the number of needed animals.  Task 5 will be conducted off-site at the NIEHS.  The Offerors should respond to and be proficient in all five tasks.   The Offeror shall be able to treat pups less than five days old.  All work shall be performed in a manner compatible with the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Health and Safety Minimum Requirements.  All laboratory records shall be kept in accordance with FDA Good Laboratory Practice regulations (Federal Register, Friday, September 4, 1987, pp. 33768-33782 (21 CFR Section 58).  All animal care and handling procedures shall be in accord with the appropriate sections of the NIEHS Specifications for the Conduct of Studies to Evaluate the Toxic and Carcinogenic Potential of Chemical, Biological and Physical Agents in Laboratory Animals for the NTP."



The contract will be a level of effort, term-form cost reimbursement type contract.  It is estimated the project will require .5 professional person-years per contract year and 3 technical person-years per contract year.  Task 5 will require 1 technical person - year per contract year.  The Principal Investigator and professional staff must have training and experience in cytogenetic and chemical mutagen assays using the procedures describe in the Statement of  Work (SOW).  The Principal Investigator shall also have current experience in directing a mutagenicity testing program.  Technical personnel shall have training and experience in the use of in vivo cytogenetics assays and the assays described in the SOW.    

New technology has automated the process of counting the number of micronuclei cells on slides and therefore a Flow Cytometer is required of the Offeror to perform this project.  It is imperative that the Offeror own a Flow Cytometer and do not subcontract the equipment.       

Small Business concerns having research and development capabilities in this field and facilities for the performance of this work are invited to submit a summary of qualifications to the procuring office listed in this notice within 30 calendar days from the date of this notice.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-08.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541611 with a small business size standard of $6.0 million.

It is the intent of the Office of Computer and Communications Systems (OCCS), National Library of Medicine (NLM), under the National Institutes of Health to acquire professional support services from Mr. Joseph Hutchins of Annapolis, Maryland.

The development pace for the next generation of the technological framework for new biomedical information venues continues to accelerate year to year.  It is the mission of the NLM to be at the forefront of providing biomedical information and literature via all means, including technological means.  Future development requires the necessary guidance for the NLM with the efficient handling of objects and more sophisticated Web-serving and such enabling technologies as search engines and linkages among distributed databases.  Mr. Hutchins will provide NLM management with critical advice on a wide variety of technical issues, e.g., information technology infrastructure, adherence to international standards, database management system selection and use, library automation systems and document delivery systems.  

Specifically, the OCCS/NLM requires the specialized services of an individual with an expert knowledge and understanding of strategic planning for information technology, and the implementation models for new technology innovations between computer systems, primarily library and information related systems.  

The OCCS determined that Mr. Joseph Hutchins possesses the unique combination of  knowledge, skills and information technology expertise that is necessary to accomplish the following tasks for dissemination of biomedical information :  1) the design and implementation of software to support the Digital Archive project; 2) abstract creation and maintenance project;  3) HSTAT reinvention project; 4) bioethics support project and the Encompass project which supports the NLM's History of Medicine Division's finding aids and the index catalogue.  

Mr.  Hutchins has over  30 years of Federal employment.  NLM's legacy systems were custom developed for the NLM.  Virtually all of NLM's legacy systems have been replaced by more modern open systems.  Mr. Hutchins recognized the advantages of appropriate commercially available products and NLM's reinvented systems are comprised of a combination of custom and commercially available products.  He was instrumental in co-opting existing technologies in dealing with electronic information and resources to eliminate inefficiency and duplication of effort.    He effectively utilized emerging technologies to use the Web as a delivery mechanism for index, abstract and full text databases.  His leadership in deploying emerging technology has enabled his strategies to be utilized across a wide range of library settings.  His efforts has enabled the widespread distribution of library resources to more people than ever before and blurring the lines between audiences, i.e., from the consumer to the biomedical researcher.  His expertise is becoming more exceedingly important to us as the demand ramps up for information libraries to store and deliver more and more images, digitized texts, and video.  

The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web site http://www.arnet.gov/far/:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items; FAR 212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; and FAR Clause 52-212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes.
