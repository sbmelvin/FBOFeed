<CONTACT>Sharon Teger Business Specialist 7037871263     sharon.teger@mms.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service intends to competitively award a contract to investigate age relationships of paleo-landforms in shallow water (less than 20 meters) on the Beaufort shelf using existing data and HEREBY SOLICITS CAPABILITY STATEMENTS from parties interested in proposing on this requirement.  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY. INTRODUCTION: The Government intends to award a cost reimbursable-type contract for service.  The period of performance for this project is estimated to be 16 months from the effective date of the contract, with an estimated cost range of $80,000 to $100,000.  The title of this study is Determining Archaeological Potential of Buried Terrestrial Landforms in the Beaufort Sea:  Review of Existing Geologic and Geophysical Data and Analysis of Existing Cores. BACKGROUND:  The MMS is required under the National Historic Preservation Act to evaluate the potential effects of our permitted activities on significant archaeological resources.  Recent geophysical data collected from OCS lease areas in the Beaufort Sea indicate the presence of relic landforms at and just beneath the seafloor shoreward of the 20-meter isobath where winter shorefast floating ice protects the seafloor from large pack ice incursions and ice gouging.  If these features are determined through this study to predate the late Wisconsinan (roughly ca. 19,000-3000 B.P.), the MMS may not need to require prehistoric archaeological analyses, avoidance, or further investigation of these areas prior to permitting activities in the Beaufort Sea. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY is to evaluate the prehistoric archaeological potential in the shallow shelf of the Beaufort Sea by investigating whether the relic terrestrial landforms observed at, and just beneath the seafloor, in the Beaufort Sea date from the late Wisconsinan or from an earlier time period.  THE STUDY CONSISTS OF SEVEN (7) MAIN TASKS: In Task 1, the contractor shall conduct a thorough review of existing geologic and geophysical data contained in published studies and reports for the Beaufort Sea including reports and data from industry drill site and pipeline clearance surveys, and the data in OCS Study MMS 2002-017 Evaluation of Sub-Sea Physical Environmental Data for the Beaufort Sea OCS.  In Task 2, using OCS Study MMS 2002-017, the contractor shall determine areas containing drowned terrestrial landforms and determine whether cores were taken in these areas. In Task 3, the contractor shall determine if cores from these surveys still exist, where they are stored, their general condition, and how they may be acquired or sampled. In Task 4, the contractor shall acquire previously drilled cores or core samples from existing Beaufort Sea industry surveys and the 1979 USGS Beaufort Sea core program in areas identified as having potential drowned terrestrial landforms. In Task 5, the contractor shall conduct laboratory analysis of samples taken from the cores associated with terrestrial landforms to extract samples for: a) radiocarbon or other isotopic dating techniques b) paleoenvironmental analyses c) archaeological analyses (if macroscopic indicators of a site such as charcoal; charred vegetal material, bone or shell; or lithic material are present) In Task 6, the contractor shall use previously acquired industry surveys and relevant USGS high-resolution seismic survey data to identify areas of potential terrestrial landforms for which sediment cores do not exist. In Task 7, if the existing data analyzed in the study are insufficient to categorically determine the age of the terrestrial landforms identified in existing seismic data, the contractor shall outline the following; a) locations where additional high-resolution seismic lines are needed to correlate terrestrial features observed in existing seismic data, b) locations where additional sediment cores are needed to evaluate terrestrial features seen in existing seismic data or where they are needed to otherwise validate seismic interpretations. HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this requirement, you MUST demonstrate that you are qualified to perform the work by providing, by June 27, 2003, 3:00 pm EST an original and seven (7) copies of a Capabilities Statement detailing (1) your key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and /or managing the study) with their qualifications and specific experience; (2) your organizational experience and facilities; and (3) specific references including contract number and project identifier & description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with the point of contact & telephone number and Email address for previous work of this nature that your key personnel or organization has performed within the last four years.

Develops, supports and interfaces with highly specialized real-time field data acquisition software.  Participates in the monitoring and maintenance of applications and systems software to ensure maximum up time of existing and newly developed software in an active operational environment.  Provides limited system support including hardware fault recovery and the installation of new layered systems software packages.  All work will be performed on Compaq Alpha computers running under the Open VMS operating system, DEC LSI-11 computers running under the RT-11 operating system, Motorola 68000 VME Bus based systems running under the OS-9 operating system, Sun computers running under the Solaris (UNIX) operating system, and Intel based PCs running under the Windows NT and Windows 2000 operating systems.  All work will be done at the NEIC within 100-150 hours per month, beginning at the date of award (est. to be o/a September 15, 2003), and shall continue through twelve months with two one-year option periods.  The solicitation can be found at the following web address:  http://ideasec.nbc.gov/.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be available.  Telephone requests for the RFP will not be accepted.

<DESC>NA The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations and Environment, has a requirement to establish a long-term business relationship for the purpose of improving and sustaining military family housing communities at the following installations:  Fort Dr um, New York, Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey, and Fort Monmouth, New Jersey.  Collectively, these projects are known as the Northeast II Group.  This requirement will be satisfied through the Army Housing privatization progr am known as the Residential Communities Initiative (RCI).  RCI operates as part of the Congressionally authorized Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI).  RCI employs best commercial practices in management, development, construction, maintenance  and operation to meet the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s long-term needs for military family housing.  The Army will award one contract for Fort Drum, and one for Carlisle Barracks/Picatinny Arsenal/Fort Monmouth project.  The selected offerors will work with the Army to cr eate a Community Development and Management Plan (CDMP) that will describe a 50-year plan to develop, re-develop, construct, maintain and operate the housing assets at each of the particular Northeast II Group projects.  The Army will solicit this requirem ent on an unrestricted basis using a Request for Qualifications (RFQ).  The Army intends to publish the first portion of the Northeast II Group RFQ on or about June 17, 2003.  The first portion of the RFQ will seek, from interested offerors, a five-page su bmission addressing three Minimum Experience Requirements (MERs).  The closing date for receipt of MER submissions will be on or about July 1, 2003.  Upon conclusion of the evaluation of the MERs, the balance of the RFQ will be issued to those offerors who  have satisfied the MERs and hence are eligible to further compete for the Northeast II Group.  Offerors will then have 30 calendar days to provide their submissions in response to the balance of the RFQ.  The Northeast II Group RFQ and amendments will be available at the Army RCI web page at http://rci.army.mil.  Selecting the Northeast II RFQ button from the Army RCI web page will allow offerors to view and download the RFQ and amendments.  Prospective offerors will be requested to register.  Registered o fferors will receive electronic notification when amendments are posted to the web page.  The Army will only respond to questions about the RFQ if they are received by electronic or facsimile medium.  The Army will not reply to any question submitted later  than 10 days prior to a submission deadline.  All comments or questions by e-mail should be directed to tracy.fetchik@usace.army.mil.  If by facsimile, comments or questions should be directed to Tracy Fetchik at (301) 677-3005.  Army responses to questio ns will be issued in the form of an amendment to the RFQ and can be found at http://rci.army.mil.

Cambridge University will perform literature review and durability of cement-bentonite and soft clay cement bentonite mixtures.  Additionally, Cambridge will perform laboratory strength testing on mixed samples, walls of overlapping soil-mixed columns, compression tests on cored samples and laboratory-scale auger mix will be developed.  Cambridge will provide a report on the results of the organic contamination on the mechanical properties of soil stabilized with wet soil mixing methods.  Cambridge has developed special scaled augers to stimulate field soil mixing in their laboratory.   They will be providing the facilities, staff and resources for the testing.  Therefore, there is no other source that will be able to provide the unique and critical success of the experimental testing program.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is June 18, 2003.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Elizabeth Durkin, Contract Specialist, (617) 494-2979
<DESC>NA The John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center intends to negotiate, on a non-competitive basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) and AR Subpart 6.302-1, with ProSensing, Inc., located in Amherst, Massachusetts.  This effort is to support the Federal Aviation Administration’s program to investigate the major principles associated with the multistatic radar concept as applied to the Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE)-3 radar system for the purpose of improving airport surveillance.  These principles include: system architecture; geometrical considerations relative to multipath target location; dependence of system performance on the number of multistatic receivers; radar cross-section behavior; antenna requirements; surface and rainfall clutter effects; bistatic  gain; resolution cell size; time synchronization; and polarimetry.  The proposed effort is a follow-on to a successful proof of concept (POC) effort that was performed by the Government with support from ProSensing, Inc., for the design and implementation of a prototype bistatic receiver and recorder system utilizing the multistatic radar principles for improving ASDE-3 performance.  Due to ProSensing, Inc.'s experience on the POC phase of this multistatic radar project, their continued effort will be both time and cost effective as it relates to bistatic receivers.  The proposed effort will entail developing an in-depth design of an ASDE-3 multistatic receiver network suitable for integration into an airport environment, including the effective combining of data from the ASDE-3 radar wit h measurements from bistatic receivers.  The design shall be to the level where a prototype can be built and tested primarily through the integration of commercial off-the-shelf components. The work shall include performing a detailed design of the prototype multistatic radar receiver, data fusion and display system that would operate in conjunction with an existing ASDE-3 radar; designing a digital receiver/signal processor card which supports the processing of the received bistatic signals; exploring implementation options for the data fusion engine; analyzing the benefits and utility of fully-polarimetric/dual polarization versus single polarization operation; developing a test plan for a field test of a prototype system; performing a study of methods for time synchronization and data l inks for bistatic sites remote to the Air Traffic Control Tower facility and the main airport terminal; and, compiling and submitting a final report.  The project shall be completed within 12 months after award of a contract.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 517910 and the small business size standard is $12.5 million.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Interested firms have fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis, to submit in writing, to the identified point of contact, clear and convincing evidence of their qualifications and/or capabilities relevant to this specific project, such as Past Performance Reports demonstrating work on comparable projects.  Such qualifications an d/or capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses received after fifteen (15) calendar days, or without the required information, will be considered non-responsive to this synopsis and will not be considered. The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this synopsis and submittals will not be returned to the sender.  Based upon the responses received to this notice, a determination may be made by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis that is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. See Note 22.  For future information about the Volpe Center refer  to the website at http://www.volpe.dot.gov.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NUMBER F34601-03-R-0354, OC-ALC/PKXDA TINKER AFB OK 73145-3015, For additional information contact Kelli Jones/LPKBB/[405] 734-8779. This requirement is for the repair/overhaul of # 1 – # 5 Carbon Seal Assembly.  MATERIAL:  Fabricated of AMS 56-13 Stainless Steel; SIZE/DIM:  # 1:  6.020 X 1.430, # 2:  P/N-4033283, 6.760 X 1.300 and P/N-4072839, 6.060 X 1.080, # 3:  8.740 X 1.355, # 4:  1.530 X 9.015, # 5:  7.050 X 1.670; FORM, FIT and FUNCTION:  The carbon seals prevent oil leakage from the bearing compartments.  The pressure of compressor bleed air surrounding bearing compartments is higher than pressure within the compartments that are being scavenged.  This pressure allows bleed air to continually flow into the compartment between the carbon seal and seal seat, allowing bleed air to become breather air.  The in-flow of air prevents oil from leaking out of the compartment.  A spring applies force to the stationary carbon seal and presses it against the rotating seal seat to seal the bearing compartment.  Oil passages in the seal seat cools the carbon seal during engine operation. The government contemplates awarding a firm fixed price requirements type contract for a three (3) year basic contract period with two one (1) year option periods. The line items are as follows: 

0001, # 1 Carbon Seal, Input/Output: 2840-00-352-2148NZ, P/N 404031515(IC), 4031516, 4031517, 37 each per month, BEQ of 415 each per year;

<DESC>Air Force Space and Missiles System Center, Global Positioning System (GPS) Joint Program Office (SMC/CZK) solicits research and development proposals for Modernized GPS User Equipment.  This is a research and development effort being acquired under the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 35.016, Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as modified for the Air Force's Program Research & Development Announcement (PRDA) Process.  Any MUE PRDA contract(s) awarded as a result of this announcement are intended to reduce risk and advance technology required for the future development of modernized military GPS User Equipment. The desired outcome at the conclusion of the PRDA contracts is a more complete understanding by the Government and industry of the technical and implementation requirements and associated risk regarding: 1) Implementation, certification, integration, and operation of the MUE Security Architecture, 2) Ability to design, develop, and produce MUE that can effectively detect, acquire, track, and process M-Code and M-Code Navigation Data (MNAV) under nominal and stressed conditions, and 3) The feasibility and advisability of implementing Y-Code signal in MUE.  The Statements of Objectives (SOOs) for each of these three efforts are posted on the GPS JPO Bidder's Library at http://gps.losangeles.af.mil/. All interested Offerors are highly encouraged to address all three SOOs in a single integrated proposal. Proposals will be accepted that do not address all three SOOs, based on the Government acceptance of justification for omissions and Government evaluation of exceptional merit in furthering a particular MUE program objective. The Government feels that there are significant synergies and interdependences among the SOOs and will closely evaluate proposed technical solution strategies that address these interdependencies and/or synergies.  Proposals should be structured to explicitly capitalize on synergies between the three study subjects and how these interdependencies and synergies are to be exploited.  Interested offerors are highly encouraged to view and/or download the full MUE PRDA solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) homepage at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Direct questions to the Contracting Point of Contact identified in the announcement.  A Pre-proposal Conference will be held on Tuesday 4 March 2003 from 8:00 am to 10:00 with one-on-one meetings to follow at the Aerospace Corporation, Building A-1, Room 1062, 2350 E. El Segundo Blvd., El Segundo, CA  90245. Attendance is limited to a maximum of ten (10) people from each company/division.  Follow-on one-on-one sessions and facility access information should be coordinated with Lt Richard Kniseley, (310) 363-5390, richard.kniseley@losangeles.af.mil by 3 Mar 2003. Time allotted per contractor will depend on the number of one-on-one requests received.  Small businesses are highly encouraged to participate.  The Government reserves the right to award contract(s) to small business(es) that satisfactorily demonstrate required capability. The NAICS code is 541710 and the size standard is 1000 employees.

<CONTACT>LCDR John H. Windom (202) 781-4965 LtCol Kelvin Nathaniel at nathanielkr@navsea.navy.mil Mr. Joe Ryan at  ryanjp@navsea.navy.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) for SINGLE INTEGRATED AIR PICTURE (SIAP) “MODEL DRIVEN ARCHECTURE” COST ESTIMATING PROCESS  1. OVERVIEW:  The Single Integrated Air Picture System Engineering (SIAP SE) Task Force is building an Integrated Architecture Behavior Model, “Platform-Independent Model (PIM),” that when implemented produces a Single Integrated Air Picture.  The PIM is a dynamic behavior model written in executable Unified Modeling Language (UML) that the Services (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines) will then be able to use to design and code a platform-specific SIAP solution.  This approach provides the SIAP capability to the Services in an expeditious and economical manner.  This Request for Information (RFI) solicits industry’s views on the cost elements, models, and assumptions that the task force should consider when calculating the costs and risks associated wit h the development, implementation, and testing of the SIAP solution into specific Tactical Battle Management command and control (C2) systems.  Consultation services may ultimately be acquired to support the PIM development and evolution of SIAP.  Therefore expert, innovative and timely responses are strongly encouraged.   2. BACKGROUND:  The SIAP SE Task Force is charged with implementing a disciplined system engineering process to identify and recommend the most effective and efficient means to achieve a SIAP capability that satisfies warfighter needs.  The product of the SIAP SE recommendations will be combat-ready, operationally certified equipment and computer programs that enable the warfighter to build and maintain a SIAP, as well as inputs to tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) necessary to operate the components of the integrated system.  The respective servi ce shall perform specific engineering tasks to support the SIAP SE in executing its chartered responsibilities.  3.  Responses are requested by 10:00 am (EST), on 13 June 2003 to support our milestone objectives. However, submissions will be accepted after this date but feedback may not be as timely.  Information should be e-mailed to Lt Col Kelvin Nathaniel at nathanielkr@navsea.navy.mil, Mr. Joe Ryan at ryanjp@navsea.navy.mil and LCDR John H. Windom at windomjh@navsea.navy.mil.  General questions concerning this RFI may be directed to LCDR Windom at the aforementioned e-mail address or at 202.781.4965.  Technical questions should be directed to LtCol Nathaniel and/or Mr. Ryan. Information provided will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies without the permission of the provider and shall be provided free of charge to the Government. 4.  See solicit ation for complete details.

<SOLNBR>N44255-03-R-3001
<RESPDATE>121503
<CONTACT>Patrick Donnelly, Contracting Officer, Phone 360-396-0326, Fax 360-396-0954, Email donnellypj@efanw.navfac.navy.mil
<DESC>Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Engineering Field Activity, Northwest (EFANW), in conjunction with the Commander, Navy Region Northwest, plans to offer for privatization, the existing water distribution systems at the following six locations in the Pacific Northwest:  Naval Air Station Whidbey Island (NASWI) Ault Field, NASWI Seaplane Base, NASWI Outlying Field Coupeville, NUWC Keyport, Camp Wesley Harris, and Jim Creek Naval Radio Station.  Privatization is a process that (1) conveys a utility system or a part of a utility system under the jurisdiction of the Secretary concerned to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity and (2) obtains a utility service contract from the entity to whom the system is conveyed or their agents and assignees. As a result of this solicitation, a firm will be selected to assume ownership of the utility system. The successful firm will be required to purchase the existing system from the Government and may be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the Government. The successful firm may or may not be the supplier of the commodity procured by the Government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system. The Contractor shall manage the upgrades, maintenance, repairs, and replacement of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service connection within the service area in accordance with industry standards. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, upgrade, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. The Contractor's proposals and plans may become a part of the contract upon the decision to award. Past Performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. No Offeror will be denied the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to the RFP. Proposal due dates will be identified in the solicitation.  The utility systems being privatized are described as follows:  1. WHIDBEY (Ault Field and Seaplane Base).  Ault Field is the point of delivery for potable water from the City of Oak Harbor. Ault Field then supplies water to Seaplane Base.  There are three standby wells with a total capacity of 224 gallons per minute  (2 located  on Ault Field and 1 on Seaplane Base).  There are two active wells (1@15gpm and 1@20gpm)  on Seaplane Base. The total storage for Ault Field and Seaplane Base is 4.4 million gallons. Average water consumption for NAS Whidbey Island  is 1 million gallons per day. Peak summer consumption is twice the winter consumption. The Sea Plane Base, primarily housing, is one half the total use. Distribution piping on Ault Field and the Sea Plane Base consists of 50 miles of cement asbestos, cast iron, ductile iron, steel, galvanized iron, and PVC from four inches to eighteen inches in diameter. Most common  is cement asbestos installed from about the mid 1950s up to the mid 1970s.   2.  WHIDBEY (Outlying Field).  There are two active wells at OLF Coupeville. One well (15gpm) with a 1300 gallon storage tank  is for the field firefighting and the caretaker’s house. The other well (10gpm) serves the Combat Trainer building.  3.  NUWC KEYPORT.  The water system at NUWC Keyport  water system utilizes a 650gpm production well, 600K gallons of storage reservoirs, a booster pump station, distribution pipelines and two pressure zones. The water distribution piping system consists of approximately 45,000 lineal feet of 4-inch, 6-inch, 10-inch, and 12-inch  diameter ductile iron main pipelines.  4.  CAMP WESLEY HARRIS.  Potable water is produced and delivered to the station from one 10gpm primary well. There is one chlorinating station (hypo chlorinator is not in use) and a 500 gallon potable water day tank which supplies approximately 4,000 lineal feet of water lines. There is a 20K gallon non-potable fire reservoir with a booster pump and three fire hydrants.  5.  JIM CREEK.  At Jim Creek, water is obtained directly from a 150-foot drilled well at a  rate of 175 gallons per minute. The water pumped from the well is processed through an ozone treatment unit, located in the pump house (Building 85). The water is then transferred through a sand filter, which reduces the levels of iron and manganese and pumped into a 250K gallon tank and gravity-fed to the users through approximately 16,000 lineal feet of pipe. In-house service and maintenance are provided, including the dumping and cleaning of tanks, checking pulleys and cables, floats, and filtering systems, ozonerator and its compressors. Water is tested monthly for impurities and certified by the State of Washington.  The solicitation will be provided for download free of charge via the Internet at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil/. Amendments and notices will be posted on the web site http://esol.navfac.navy.mil/ for downloading. This will be the only method of distributing the solicitation.

The official plan holders list will be maintained on and can be printed from the web site. All prospective Offerors and plan centers are encouraged to register as plan holders on the web site.

<DESC>NASA/HQ plans to extend Contract No. NASW-98010 entitled "NASA Student Involvement Program (NSIP) Support" for NASA Headquarters, Code JE, Washington, DC, with TERC, Inc., for twelve months from the period July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2004.  It is anticipated that a follow-on Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) will be in place by April 15, 2004.  This extension will provide continued performance during the interim period until the new Cooperative Agreement can be awarded.  TERC is uniquely qualified to perform this requirement without substantial duplication of cost to the Government, due to its current involvement in this project.  The statutory authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Agency's requirements. Only TERC, the current incumbent, has the required expertise and infrastructure in place to provide these services on short notice for the 2003/2004 school year.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), has a requirement for Federal Monitoring and Oversight in Long Term Care Facilities.  An award resulting from this solicitation will be made on the basis of a cascading evaluation preference approach.  It is CMSs intent to award one five (5) year contract under NAICS Code 541618 in fiscal year 2003, on a negotiated competitive basis to an eligible business concern included in one of the following three (3) cascading preference tiers, provided that adequate competition is received and award can be made a fair market price.  Adequate competition is defined as: the receipt of at least two (2) competitive proposals in a tier that are qualified, technically acceptable, cost reasonable and responsible business concerns.   The solicitation will be available on or about June 18, 2003.  The closing date for receipt of offers will be addressed therein.  Interest parties shall obtain a copy of the solicitation by accessing the following webpage: www.fedbizopps.gov.   This process will be completed in an electronic media only through this fedbizopp publication.  Interested parties will need to register in order to be notified of the RPF release and the release of any subsequent amendments.

The cascading evaluation preference is to be applied in the following manner:

First Tier Competition:

This tier is defined by competition among 8(a) (including Hubzone 8(a))  business concerns.  It is the desire of CMS to award a contract to an eligible 8(a) or Hubzone business concern provided that adequate competition is received (2 or more eligible entities) and award can be made at a fair market price (see definition at FAR Part 19).  Offerors submitting proposals under the First Tier or Second Tier Competitions must be providing 51% or more of the direct labor dollars proposed for the required contract effort.


In the event that competitive and price requirements cannot be met under the First Tier Competition and there is only one technically qualified firm offering a fair market price, then the competition for this Tier will stop.  However, the one qualified firm from this Tier will become eligible to compete in the Second Tier Competition, as defined below.  

Second Tier Competition:

This Tier is defined by competition among eligible small business concerns that are not included in the First Tier and only becomes effective in the event that the First Tier Competition does not result in an award.    Offerors submitting proposals under the First Tier or Second Tier Competitions must be providing 51% or more of the direct labor dollars proposed for the required contract effort.

Again, in the event that the First Tier Competition results in only one 8(a) concern determined to be technically qualified and offering a fair market price, then that firm will be considered in the Second Tier Competition.

In the event that there are no eligible firms in the Second Tier Competition, then the competition for this Tier will stop.  At this point, the one qualified firm from First Tier becomes eligible to compete in the Third Tier Competition, as defined below.  Furthermore, if no proposal received for the First Tier Competition is deemed acceptable (technically qualified, reasonable cost), and only one proposal received for the Second Tier Competition is determined to be acceptable, then CMS may consider that the Second Tier proposal for award under the Third Tier Competition.  

Third Tier Competition:

This Tier is defined as an unrestricted, full and open competition with selection of an awardee based upon a best value determination pursuant to FAR 15.3.  For evaluation purposes of First Tier and/or Second Tier entitites that are being considered for award with the Third Tier offerors, a price evaluation adjustment for small disadvantaged business concerns and for Hubzone small disadvantaged business concerns may be applied in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.11 and Section 19.1307.

Provided below is a brief description of the requirements for this effort:

Description:  Strengthening federal oversight and monitoring across the 16,800+ long term care facilities that currently exist in the country while taking aggressive action steps to protect individuals who live in long term care facilities through the use of comparative surveys, complaint investigations and special surveys of compliance.

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics believes that the Journal of Commerce Port Import Export Reporting Service (PIERS) has the unique capability to provide particular research services with representatives in the field collecting and encoding ships manifests from Customs Houses in every US port.  Other trade data sources either rely on the reprocessing of the Census forms, which does not contain information on the shipper, carrier or containers, or are based on the Customs Services Automated Broker Interface which only captures information on Imports.  The Journal of Commerce has an established netwrok of data collection, processing and distribution that make it the only qualified vendor of this type of import export data. This is not a request for proposal.  Comments on this notification may be e-mailed as indicated below.

<DESC>The Washington Circle (WC) is a ad hoc group of national experts in substance use disorders, managed care, and performance measurement in both the public and private sectors, who seek to improve the quality and effectiveness of substance use treatment services through the use of performance measurement systems.  This group was convened by the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in March 1998, and has set forth two major goals to (1) develop and pilot test a core set of performance measures for substance abuse treatment for public and private sector health plans and (2) collaborate with a broad range of stakeholders to ensure widespread adoption of substance abuse performance measures by private employers, public payers and accrediting organizations.

The development, testing, and implementation of public/private performance measures is a complex task for a number of reasons and has and will take a number of years to be effective.  Adult performance measurement is new to the substance abuse field.  Both addictions and mental health lag behind other areas of health care in developing performance measures and incorporating them into evaluation and monitoring systems.  Performance measurement for children and adolescents shows even more significant gaps.

<DESC>CERTs is an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) program whose mission is to conduct research and provide education that will advance the best use of therapeutics (drugs, medical devices, and biological products).  The evaluation of medical devices poses challenges that are different from those encountered in the evaluation of drugs.  In the evaluation of diagnostic imaging technologies many added complexities are raised.   

A two-day Conference is needed to develop a research agenda for the CERTs that will extend their current focus to two areas of special interest to the Medicare program:  evaluation of medical devices and the evaluation of diagnostic imaging technologies.  These two areas account for large portions of new medical innovations as well as large portions of the current and future health care budget.  
 
This workshop would bring together a select group of experts knowledgeable about a particular topic from a variety of perspectives (such as academia, consumer, government, health care practitioner, medical products industry) to answer important questions related to the study and use of medical devices.  The goal of the proposed conference is to develop specific short and long term research agendas in these areas that can form the basis for initial work of one or more CERTS.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to procure, on a sole source basis, with Google, Inc., the Google Search Appliance hardware and software combination.  The Google Search Appliance (model GB-1001) can index up to 150,000 documents and can handle 60 queries per minute, providing adequate resources to support the search needs of cms.hhs.gov users.  The Google Search Appliance is a self-contained package completely configured to support search (and no other features).  Once the initial configuration of the server is complete, future administration of the server is done through a web-based interface.  No special expertise on the hardware or operating system is required.  Because this is a self-contained hardware, it will not affect the rest of the AT&T hosting environment.  No other servers will have to be changed to support this new hardware.  And, it will effectively index our website content as is, without the need to recode pages or develop standardized metadata repositories.  As CMS has advanced, the technical sophistication of our websites over the past years, the traffic to our websites has significantly increased.  As a result, CMS has outgrown the Google hosted search solution as a cost-effective option.  Based on a market analysis and a review of competitive search services, we find that the Google Search Appliance is the only available search software-hardware combination that can effectively meet the Agency’s current business and financial need.  If no written response is received within 45 calendar days from the published date of this notice, a purchase order shall be awarded to Google, Inc., 2400 Bayshore Parkway, Mountain View, CA  94043.  An RFQ package is not available.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13. The NAICS code is 541512 with a small business size standard of $21.0 million.  It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis with Redwing Satellite Solutions, England, for a continuation of their existing services in coordinating and managing an electronic research communications network which enables medical researchers working in Africa to have full access to the Internet and the WorldWide Web.  NLM has determined that Redwing Satellite Solutions (RSS) Ltd. has the unique expertise and experience in working in remote African sites that are necessary to continue to provide these researchers with successful turnkey support -- from equipment purchase and installation to a single carrier per channel satellite solution that offers Internet point-to-point connectivity between research sites in Africa (often in remote locations) and an Internet access point in the UK.  RSS has been involved with all of the above stated activities since the inception of the project four years ago and is currently providing turnkey service to 11 research centers in Africa where full access to the Internet and Worldwide Web had not been possible previously.  RSS provides VSAT services to the following areas:  (1)  Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)/ US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - Kisian, Kenya; (2)  KEMRI/UK Wellcome Trust - Kilifi, Kenya; (3) KEMRI/US Walter Reed Army Institute for Research (WRAIR) - Nairobi, Kenya; (4) KEMRI/CDC - Nairobi, Kenya; (5) International Center of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) - Mbita Center, Kenya; (6)  Noguchi Memorial Institute - Accra, Ghana; (7) Navrongo Health Resaerch Center - Navrongo, Ghana; (8) National Institute for Medical Research - Amani, Tanzania; (9) Ifakara Centre - Ifakara, Tanzania; (10) Uganda Viral Research Institute/CDC - Entebbe, Uganda; (11)  Malaria Research Centre, Albert Schweitzer Hospital - Lambarene, Gabon. RSS also provides Internet access to African areas.  

RSS's experience in working with research centers in remote areas of Africa, under a variety of African conditions and its successful collaboration with various African agencies involved, have been integral to the early success of this important Federal project in disseminating biomedical information to underserved African nations.  Redwing has worked with NLM and other Federal agencies to create a solution not previously available or affordable.  RSS's solution simplifies the network design and minimizes the amount of bandwidth required to support the work at the research sites.  RSS also handles project documentation, administration and billing, strategic planning and support, workshops and special projects.  RSS has provided these services for the past year.  This requirement is for a base year and the option of four (4) one-year option period(s).   RESPONSES ARE DUE BY 12:00 PM JUNE 10, 2003, AND SHALL BE SENT VIA EMAIL TO: KR33V@NIH.GOV. The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web site http://www.arnet.gov/far/: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items; FAR 212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; and FAR Clause 52-212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Notice of Contract Action.  This is not a solicitation; this is a follow-on announcement to a previously issued request for information.  On 3 Apr 2003, ESC/DIG issued a request for information to identify possible sources for a transportable/deployable Hub Satellite Communications (SATCOM) terminal that operates in multiple SHF bands over commercial, national, and military satellites and that would be available for an operational demonstration to and evaluation by Air Force personnel in the summer of 2003. The purpose of this announcement is to publish the details of the previously announced demonstration/evaluation. The demonstration/evaluation will take place between 14 Jul 2003 and 29 Aug 2003 at Langley AFB, VA.  Each vendor will have one week (Monday through Friday) for its demonstration/evaluation.  Only one terminal will be evaluated at a time. The tentative schedule for each demonstration/evaluation is as follows: Monday - setup and technical evaluation; Tuesday - user familiarization; Wednesday/Thursday - usability/suitability evaluation; and Friday - tear down and pack up. The Air Force will provide space, power, tents or other cover, and any required satellite access. The Air Force will not pay for any costs associated with participation in the demonstration/evaluation to include shipping, travel, per diem or other related expenses. Detailed technical requirements and the evaluation criteria are available on the Internet at the Hanscom Air Force Base Electronic Request for Proposals Bulletin Board (HERBB) website: http://herbb.hanscom.af.mil/rfp_list.asp by selecting the link Theater Deployable Communications Hub Satellite Terminal. Interested participants should respond no later than 15 business days after publication of this announcement.  Responses must include applicable DSCS certifications (if available) and INTELSAT identification numbers. Responses should also identify any preference for demonstration week. Note that our intent is to complete the evaluations as quickly as possible - we have allocated time for seven (7) terminals; if there are fewer responses, we will compress the schedule accordingly.  Specific date or order preferences will be accommodated on a first come, first served basis.  Interested participants who did not respond to the previous RFI must also include product specifications and details on how the product meets the requirements stated in the Technical Requirements Document as well as information as to whether equipment is available through GSA or other government agency contracts, with appropriate pricing information.  Provide one (1) copy of the response to ESC/DIGK, 5 Eglin St., Attn: John Sorgini, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-2100 (use 3 Eglin St. for Fed Ex packages). This is not a solicitation.  This is a market survey.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requested.  In addition, the Government will not pay for any costs associated with participation in the demonstration. Contact Joan Wandrei (781) 377-7965 or joan.wandrei@hanscom.af.mil with questions regarding this notice.

<DESC>The Government intends to conduct an economic feasibility study for utilities privatization to determine whether it is economically feasible to negotiate and award a contract to privatize the water utility distribution system at F.E. Warren AFB, Wyoming, which would include granting access and transferring ownership to the system.  If the study results in a favorable economic determination, a contract will be awarded for up to fifty (50) years for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the utility distribution system, with access granted through execution of a Right of Way, and with transfer of title occurring through execution of a Bill of Sale.  The O&M contract will be governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. The transfer of property and granting of access is authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2688.  The water utility distribution system at F.E. Warren AFB, WY supports 6,500 people, 5,866 acres, and 800 buildings comprised of 4.41 million square feet.  The successful offeror will be required to comply with all service distribution requirements outlined in the solicitation, to obtain all applicable permits, licenses and certifications necessary for performance, and to possess the financial resources necessary to provide utility distribution system operation and maintenance, as well as required capital improvements.  In order to be considered for contract award, non-regulated utilities will be required to obtain performance bonds.  The Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate for Replacement Cost New Less Depreciation of the system is $7,127,674 and the fifty year estimated budget for Operation and Maintenance (O&M) is $47,852,488.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to respond to questions received in reference to the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) for the Human Resources Services and Information Center (HRSIC) Travel (TVL) Branch in Topeka, Kansas released 25 February 2003.  A copy of the Questions and Answers are as follows:  1) Question:  Can monthly workload totals be provided for a minimum of 12 consecutive months (preferably 24 consecutive month) for 5.4.1.1. "Process TDY travel claims", and 5.4.1.2. "Process PCS Military claims"?  Answer: Previously, information was requested from the MEO team on monthly totals to validate peak periods. These monthly totals were provided as an answer to MEO question #7 (Historical data for peak periods, April through October, shows fluctuations during this time period with peaks and valleys.  Historical data reflects total claims processed as:  April 12,402, May 13,411, June 13,628, July 12,574, August 13,342, September 12,940, and October 14,526.  These totals only include supplemental and final military TDY and PCS claims.). The workload output tables contain necessary information to provide travel settlements in all areas of the travel process.  2) Question:  Currently, HRSIC Travel Branch staff states that the HRSIC Customer Servioce Division is performing training in 5.3 to external customers.  Can this work requirement be verified?  Answer: The requirement of the SP to develop and maintain a training curriculum for the purpose of training and familiarizing external customers in the travel settlement process has not changed. The Customer Service Division informally began in March 2003 and no empirical data or direction has been formulated to affect this PWS.  The modification of responsibilities and duties were included under C-5.6 of the PWS.  3) Question:  Currently, the Travel Branch staff states that they DO NOT update the Quick Reference Guide (QRG) in 5.3.1, but the PWS states that the SP will update these guides.  Can this work requirement be verified?  Answer: The requirement of the SP to provide, maintain and continually update training aids to include the QRG is a PWS requirement. Historically this has been an annual change and Travel Branch is responsible for the update.

*****Questions & Answers****** 

1)	Is there a recommended power output requirement for the transmitter?

Answer:  No specific power is recommended or required.  Base station shall typically be located outside of a structure and monitor system shall be located within the structure.  The structure shall vary from steel sided warehouse with windows to a single story ranch style house. 

2) What is the maximum temperature that the monitor must withstand?

Answer: Because the monitors shall be attached to fire fighters, and because prolonged exposure to temperatures above 140 degrees Fahrenheit tends to injure fire fighters, the maximum temperature shall not exceed 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

3) Does the monitor need any specific type of attachment mechanism to the firefighter?

Answer:  The monitor does not have to have any specific type of attachment mechanism.  However, it should have some type of reasonable mechanism appropriate for use by fire fighters such as button, lip-on, belt, strap, vest or pocket versions are all acceptable.

4) Has this product been purchased in the past? If so, when and for how much?

Answer:  Yes, NIST purchased this product in 2002 for $19,999.

5) What is the anticipated cost for this project?  

Answer:  The anticipated cost of this project shall be within the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.

6) Do you anticipate any need for more monitors in the future?

Answer:	 If monitor systems provide satisfactory service, NIST may choose to purchase up to 12 additional units in the future.

<CONTACT>Ken Kaseforth, (612) 713-5219 Contract Specialist 6127135219 Ken_Kaseforth@fws.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposes to noncompetitively issue a purchase order, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.106-1(b)(1),  to Coast Machinery, Inc., 10012 Umbehagen Lane, Baton Rouge, LA 70817, a small business manufacturer under NAICS 336999's size standard of 500 or less employees.  The Service proposes to purchase of a single Marsh Master II.  It is a tracked, fully amphibious vehicle configured for firefighting. This machine can carry a payload of 1,500 lbs (consisting of at least two persons and their firefighting equipment plus 110 gallons of water contained in twin 55-gallon water tanks mounted within the unit's pontoons) through marshes and swamps in order to contain and extinguish wildland fires within those terrains. Its drive system, composed of a rubber-belt track encircling each of the two pontoons and run via sealed bogey wheels, is patented and results in very low ground pressure on land as well as minimal track maintenance. The track is corrosion-resistant and requires no lubrication. The MarshMaster II is designed to provide a low, stable center of gravity but high ground clearance. It operates simply and reliably through dual fingertip levers for one-handed control of the pontoon tracks via twin hydrostatic transmissions coupled to a water-cooled diesel engine. Top speeds are 10 mph on land and 2 mph on water. The body is made of high-strength aluminum, which minimizes weight and thus improves operational capacities. Aluminum construction also avoids the serious issue of rust corrosion common in wet environs, and all seams are welded to improve strength and ensure watertight operation. This unit is 14'6" long by 8' wide, a sufficient size to be useable for its intended purpose while being transportable without special permits. It comes with a heavy-duty trailer made specifically for hauling this particular type of machine. The manufacturer rented a new MarshMaster II (fitted with the company's fire suppression option) and new trailer to the Government for a two-month period, and has offered to sell these particular units to the Government for a price discounted by 80% of the rental cost. Other companies that manufacture or supply comparable amphibious firefighting vehicles should submit their qualifications in writing and specifically address their product's effectiveness in conducting amphibious firefighting to the Contracting Officer. Include standard brochures and specification sheets.  Information received will be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See Note 1.

<DESC>NA This is a sources sought notice for planning purposes only.  The Army Research Office (ARO) intends to award a grant to support the Research and Engineering Apprenticeship Program (REAP) during the period of September 2003 through September 2008.  In 1980,  the ARO established the REAP for high school students to help ensure the availability of personnel with a high degree of orientation towards science and engineering.  The immediate objectives of the program are to provide socially and economically disadva ntaged high school students the opportunity to attend US colleges and universities in their localities during the summer months, to spend time in the research laboratories and to obtain hands-on experience in science and engineering.  The long range object ives of the REAP are to encourage the students to continue their education beyond the high school level by attending US colleges and universities, to obtain degrees in science and engineering and to  seek careers in the science and engineering fields.  The  REAP grant provides funds for (i) the grantee to conduct and administer the program (ii) guidance and instruction to the students by the participating college and university faculty members (mentors) and (iii) financial assistance to the selected students  during the summer months.  Based on history, the REAP grantee awards approximately 110-112 sub-grants annually to various pre-approved universities that have agreed to participate in the REAP and provide mentors for the selected students.  Approximately 7 8% of the REAP funds are allocated by the grantee directly to the colleges and universities (sub-grantees).  In excess of 50% of the sub-grant funds are payments directly to the students primarily to reimburse them for travel and living expenses and for ne eded text books and study materials.  The sub-grantees use the remaining funds for laboratory supplies, instructional books, etc. to support the student research.  The sub-grantees are responsible for providing the administrative management, facilities, su pport effort and mentors for the selected students who conduct the research efforts.  Indirect costs will not be allowed to be charged by the sub-grantees.  The REAP grantee will be required to prepare and to provide the ARO an annual report of accomplishm ents.  The Academy of Applied Science is currently conducting the program.  Any organization that is qualified and interested in performing this effort for the anticipated five-year period may provide its organization's capability statement and relevant ex perience with similar programs by 17 June 2003 to Mrs. Kathryn Terry, Contracting Officer, via e-mail at terry@aro.arl.army.mil or via fax at 919-549-4388.  The technical point of contact is Ms Peggy Lacewell (lacewell@aro.arl.army.mil).

PCB’s, cabling, connectors, and necessary strain relief will all be in accordance with mil-spec, or as required to achieve reliability necessary to support workload production.
  
Documentation development or support
Contractor may be required to make minor or major modifications to existing technical orders, test requirements documents, or other pertinent publications. These same documents may require establishment or re-development in their totality. 
Engineering services
Contractor may be required to assess any test or series of tests for test adequacy or necessity. This may include establishing test requirements where test voids are discovered during the re-host process.  
Contractor may be required to establish test requirements from available engineering or other documentation such as acceptance test procedures, diagrams, schematics, and technical orders.   
Equipment acquisition
Additional test platforms of a model and configuration that will support in-progress re-host efforts will be procurable under the provisions of this contract as well as peripheral additions necessary to adapt the station to accept new workload.

<SUBJECT>99 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services. The Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled has been asked to consider adding to its Procurement List the United States Department of Agriculture/Farm Service Agency requirement for processed dry Pinto Beans (NSN 8915-00-NSH-0119), Yellow Dry Split Peas (NSN 8915-00-NSH-0120), Green Dry Split Peas (NSN 8915-00-NSH-0121), and Lentils (NSN 8915-00-NSH-0668) which are currently being provided under contract to the Federal Government. This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.  In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm's sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<SUBJECT>A -- Durable Silver Diffraction Gratings
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY LICENSEE TO PRODUCE DURABLE SILVER DIFFRACTION GRATINGS


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking an industrial partner who is willing to fund cooperative research and license the technology to build Durable Silver Diffraction Gratings.  The final goal of this process is the commercialization of this technology by the industrial partner who would produce and sell durable silver diffraction gratings.

Many optical applications use diffraction gratings, such as spectroscopic devices and lasers.  In many of these applications, the efficiency and power handling of the diffraction grating is very important to the overall system performance.  Systems that require broadband reflectivity currently use gold-coated diffraction gratings.  Silver metal offers higher reflectivity and lower absorption than gold, but it tarnishes easily.  

Researchers at LLNL have developed durable silver, which does not tarnish and can operate in harsh environments, and the researchers have successfully produced diffraction gratings which use this durable silver technology.  These durable silver diffraction gratings offer improved diffraction efficiency compared to current diffraction gratings.  Further R&D is required to determine power handling ability and the ability to withstand oxidizing environments such as plasma discharges and UV-ozone cleaning.

The new durable silver diffraction gratings use a vacuum process to apply the following layers onto the corrugations of the diffraction grating:  an adhesion layer, a layer of silver and a layer of protective overcoat.  The performance of the diffraction grating is the result of the index of refraction of the metal layer, the absorption of the metal layer, the characteristics of the grating profile, the details of the deposition method, and the amount of materials deposited in the layers.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Durable Silver Diffraction Gratings should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing the this technology.





Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO000019-03

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Durable Silver Diffraction Gratings.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION

In order to assist its disaster support mission, Federal Emergency Management Agency* (FEMA) agents in a number of dedicated response centers receive calls on a general 800 number from the disaster stricken public.  The agent takes information from the disaster victim, then transcribes the information required to apply for disaster assistance.  If an agent services a caller who speaks a language that the agent is not directly capable of understanding, the agent must have immediate access to an interpretation support service.  The FEMA agent can then establish a three-way conference, including a representative from the support service able to interactively translate the conversation.   One of the most specialized and high priority aspects of this requirement is the ability to handle calls made by the linguistically diverse residents and potential disaster victims of the United States and its territories.  Since the birth of FEMA’s 800-disaster response system, the agency has encountered more than 83 languages (Appendix A of the Performance Work Statement).  

FEMA must have a reliable source of contract language services support.  The historical usage patterns of FEMA disaster relief hotlines (Appendix B of the Performance Work Statement) are subject to both high volumes and extreme fluctuations.  The contractor providing translation support must be capable of providing service subject to these demands on a continuous twenty-four hour a day basis.  The successful contractor shall have the capability to handle a minimum of 700 calls per day.

Offerors shall submit pricing on a per minute basis.  For a useful method of comparison, 545,000-minutes per year will be used in the price analysis of proposals received.  This is only an estimate – it is not a guarantee that this many minutes per year will actually be required.  The minimum guarantee for this contract is 30,000 minutes.  The maximum for this contract is 4,500,000 minutes.

SCOPE OF SERVICES

The U.S. Agency for International Development in Washington D.C. (USAID) is an independent Federal Government agency that provides foreign assistance and humanitarian aid to underdeveloped and developing countries. The agency awards approximately $4 billion dollars in federal contracts and grants each fiscal year. About one half of the contract and grant awards made by USAID are negotiated, issued and administered by the Office of Procurement in Washington D.C. The other half are negotiated, issued and administered by Contracting and Grant staff located at USAID Missions worldwide. Contracts are awarded primarily for technical assistance. Grants and Cooperative Agreements are awarded for a variety of programs. The primary program which the contractor(s) will support will be HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS transcends almost every instrument in the Global Health portfolio. HIV/AIDS funding has been placed in awards in the following areas: Child Survival; Family Planning and Reproductive Health; Population Policy; Health Sector Reform; Communication, Management and Training; Research; Contraceptive Logistics Management; and Maternal Health. The full extent of procurement needs includes not only HIV/AIDS and Infectious Disease (ID), but other specific areas identified in the authorizing legislation, such as, Mother to child Transmissions, Faith based Organization and Orphans.


The Contractor(s) will be expected to successfully perform a full range of preaward and post-award duties. The Contractor must be familiar with a wide range of contractual vehicles including fixed price and cost type contracts, purchase orders, task orders, grants, cooperative agreements, Participating Agency Service Agreements (PASAs) and Resource Support Service Agreements (RSSAs). Actions will be highly complex and represent critical Agency objectives with short lead times. The Contractor will be expected to provide guidance to client offices on program objectives, budgetary issues, and procurement policy interpretation.

A. Analyzing requests and assisting the client office in the proper preparation of support documentation, when necessary; identify significant components of the program to be acquired; develop program objectives; terms-of-competition; price range; pricing arrangements and

D. Preparing award documentation including the preparation of the contract, file documentation and the Memorandum of Negotiation and any other pertinent file documentation;

E. Ensuring that all necessary certifications for given actions are requested and obtained;

F. Ensuring proper distribution of executed award documents;

G. Performing procurement administration functions such as modifications, investigation and resolution of a contractor delay, preparing contract performance reports, researching and developing information to resolve audit findings, responding to contractor correspondence and request for administrative award approvals and clarifying award terms and provisions to awardees and CTOs; 

H. The Contractor shall be knowledgeable and competent in the use of USAID reference sources, making determinations concerning the appropriateness of subcontracting, and assisting in the resolution of outstanding issues under acquisition and assistance instruments; and

I. Meet regularly with client offices to remain current on pending actions and issues. Work closely with client offices in developing responses to contract/grant implementation and administrative issues.


SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP: 

The successful candidate(s) will report to the Branch Chief in the branch to which he/she is assigned.
 

QUALIFICATIONS 

The successful candidate will have the following qualifications: 

1. A four year degree in the field of Business Administration or a related field. Experience may be substituted for the educational requirement if the candidate has substantial direct experience.

ADD PART V. CLAUSE (G): 
The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C Terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the vessel's  INMARSAT C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received, MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.
