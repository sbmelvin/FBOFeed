This RFI is for planning purposes only. This RFI is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. No solicitation document exists and formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI.

To enable the development of this plan, RDECOM must project what possible Cyber technologies are likely to be available over the next 30 years (either as capability enablers or threats to our armed forces). <br>  <br> Description <br> The U.S. Army Communications-Electronic Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) and associated S&T partners are conducting this RFI to solicit subject matter expertise from government partners, industry, and academia for any information or forecasts they may provide on technology trends, concept, and basic research that may shape how the world will be using Cyberspace and its multitude of associated technologies in the next 25 - 35 years. <br>  <br> Technologies of interest span all areas of Cyber, to include, but not limited to: <br>  <br> -	Advances in wired/wireless communications, protocols and associated devices, to include new standards, protocols, and communication mechanisms (i.e. 5G systems and beyond, millimeter wave technologies, etc.)  <br> -	Advances in computing Hardware & Software (i.e. massive multiprocessing chips, natural language programming, etc.) <br> -	Advances in Internet application and usage (i.e. Web 3.0, etc.) <br> -	Advances in human/machine interface (i.e. Haptics, Augmented reality, brain-machine interface)   <br> -	Advances in robotics and automation (autonomous vehicles, home of the future, etc.) <br> -	Advances in artificial intelligence & machine learning (beyond  quote mark Watson quote mark , near-intelligent agents/robots, etc.) <br> -	Advances in consumer electronics and available personal technologies (Virtual Reality TV, 3D printing, etc.) <br> -	Advances in large scale data processing and analytics (i.e. next generation database paradigms, etc.)  <br> -	Advances in global Cyberspace infrastructures and architectures (Cloud Computing & beyond, Next Generation Networks, etc.) <br>  <br>  <br> Objectives of the RFI:		 <br>  <br> 1)	Obtain awareness of promising research efforts that have the potential of impacting the future Cyber landscape. Desired information includes a basic description of the technology (including reference if available) as well as a description of how it may be used in the future and what benefits it would provide. If possible, also include expert opinion on when this technology will reach a significant level of maturity or commercialization. <br>  <br> 2)	Obtain awareness of emerging technologies that may provide orders of magnitude improvements or complete paradigm shifts in the technological landscape. Focus should be on technologies that may have application to the military, either as capability enablers and/or as potential future threats.   <br>  <br> 3)	Obtain awareness of likely technology trends spanning the next 5, 15, and 25+ years that will continue to shape the way humans (and machines) will interact with Cyberspace.  <br>  <br>  <br> Reference <br> N/A <br>  <br>  <br> Response <br> Responses to this RFI are to be received no later than 1700 Eastern Time 10 March 2013.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date.

The Coast Guard intends to conduct this procurement in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.<br /><br /><strong>As a result of the change of location of work performance from possibly three locations to one location and the change in vendor interest, this requirement is now being conducted as a small business set aside.</strong> <strong>The location of work performance will be the Industrial Support Facility, Portsmouth, VA pier.<br /><br /></strong>The NAICS code will be 336611 and the small business size standard will be less than 1000 employees.
<p>The solicitation will be issued as a best value request for proposal (RFP) approximately <strong>11 February 2013</strong> with proposals due approximately&nbsp;<strong>11 March 2013.</strong> Proposals will be evaluated using price and past performance as evaluation factors with past performance being considered more important than price. The solicitation/RFP will be issued via the Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fbo.gov/. A hard copy solicitation will not be issued. Contractors will need to monitor the FedBizOpps website for RFQ/solicitation release and any subsequent amendments.</p>
