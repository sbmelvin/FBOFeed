<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-33.  

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is being procured using full and open competition.  

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/Analytical Chemistry Division/Gas Metrology Group is responsible for developing, critically evaluating, and applying techniques for the identification and measurement of gaseous species in atmospheres and process streams. The group applies this research to certification of gas standards in support of industries responding to U.S. and state regulations, environmental concerns, fairness in trade issues, and global climate change. The primary concern is to provide the infrastructure for high-quality, traceable gas measurements on which better decisions may be made by industry, regulators, government officials, research scientists, and the public.

As part of the groups research, the detection and quantization of trace gases in the presence of a balance gas is critical.  There are many instruments that can achieve this for a subset of the gases the group are interested in.  However only the mass spectrometer is capable of analyzing all of the gases the group is interested in simultaneously.  

The Atmospheric Pressure Ionization Mass Spectrometer System (APIMS) is capable of sampling from a flowing stream of gas at atmospheric pressure, ionizing it without destroying the gas, and measuring the mass of the resultant gas.  With the mass spectrometer/mass spectrometer (MS/MS) feature, a particular gas that has been preliminarily identified by parent mass, can be further analyzed by injecting the ionized gas through another mass filter and positively identified through the fragmentation pattern.  These APIMS instruments are extremely sensitive, and can analyze gases to the parts-per-trillion level.
		
LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each Atmospheric Pressure Ionization Mass Spectrometer System.  The system must meet all of the required specifications identified herein.  All equipment must be new.  Used or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award.

1.   The instrument must be capable of measuring trace gases in the presence of balance gases of Nitrogen, Helium, Hydrogen, Air, and Argon in the parts per trillion (ppt) and parts per billion (ppb) ranges.  The instrument must be versatile enough so that it can be user tuned to analyze for impurities in a different balance gas from one day to the next.

2.  The instrument must be capable of a detection limit of 5 ppt for oxygen, water, and carbon dioxide in nitrogen; must be able to identify and quantify (signal a minimum of 10 times above detection limits) Nitrous Oxide (N2O), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) freon 11 and freon 12 in a real air sample (along with all other major constituents);  must be able to identify and quantify nominal 50 ppb Sulfur Dioxide (SO2).  The nominal 50 ppb SO2 signal from a stable and reliable source must give a standard deviation of less than 5 % relative from 5 minute averaging.   Day to Day variability of the signal from a 50 ppm SO2 source (standard deviation of 4 daily measurements) shall be less than 5 % relative.

<DESC><p>RFI/TARGETED MARKET RESEARCH AND<br />ANSWERS TO INDUSTRY QUESTIONS
<p><br />The ISSW SE&amp;I source selection team is seeking to maximize communication and request input from industry throughout the entire process before final RFP release. Our approach is to incrementally solicit your input on our draft solicitation documents in advance of a complete draft/final package. We have chosen to accomplish this in two ways: 1) to release the draft documents with a set of questions on which we are requesting your input, and 2) to respond on a regular basis to specific contractor questions that have been generalized for the entire community. We look forward to your candid input to ensure that we are delivering the clearest solicitation package to meet the ISSW Enterprise's requirements. This week we are publishing our draft Performance Work Statement and seek your comments and feedback on it. We also have the following questions:<br /><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FROM ISSW/TARGETED MARKET RESEARCH</p>
<p>1) Is the PWS an adequate description of the ISSW enterprise's SE&amp;I requirements? If not, what else do you need?</p>
<p>2) What questions would you like our Space, Ground, or EN groups to answer at the next Industry Day?</p>
<p>3) Would you prefer to bid to organizational structure or to bid a "proposed structure?"</p>
<p>4) We plan to have an objective incentive plan. What do you think the milestones/objectives for payment should be?</p>
<p>5) Our intention is to require a demonstration or fulfillment of some requirement as a key discriminator in the source selection. What do you think that the wing should select to request for a demonstration?</p>
<p>6) If you intend to bid as a prime contractor on this effort, we are requesting OCI mitigation plans be sent to us as soon as possible, ideally by July 24, but not later than July 31.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QUESTIONS FROM INDUSTRY AND ANSWERS FROM ISSW - What follows are answers to questions we have received from industry.</p>
<p>Q: What kind of processes will be changed? Stated otherwise, are there NEW processes that need to be created? If so, what?</p>
<p>A. The SBIRS Wing does not have a current SE&amp;I capability and relies on non optimized processes. Therefore the SE&amp;I contractor will have to document and manage SE&amp;I classic processes e.g. DM and CM in order to meet or provide baseline architecture information and documents.</p>
<p><br />Q: What is the work structure breakdown for the new SE&amp;I contract? (i.e. who is doing which tasks?)</p>
<p>A. The PWS will define and contain these functions for the SE&amp;I contract. Broadly stated, the current prime System Contractors will maintain their product engineering role. The Aerospace Corporation will continue to provide specialized technical expertise and assessment along with mission assurance oversight. The <br />Government will retain decision authority for all Enterprise engineering actions.</p>
<p>Q: Who will chair the review boards under the SE&amp;I contract? Is it the Wing Commander or the SE&amp;I? What level of authority will the new SE&amp;I contractor have?</p>
<p>A. The Engineering Review Boards will be chaired by the EN functional staff with cross functional input from the Government segment leads based on SE&amp;I and Aerospace assessment of the Prime Contractors' proposed changes. As stated in the PWS, the new SE&amp;I contractor, will document, manage, and assess the current Enterprise Architecture and provide to the government appropriate input for future system planning.</p>
<p>Q. How is accountability going to be measured on the SE&amp;I contract?</p>
<p>A. The PWS will require the contractor to meet objectives of all deliverable documents; quality, schedule, customer relations, internal and external interface and communications and personnel staffing/retention and cost control.</p>
<p>Q. Can we have one-on-one sessions with Program Office and Center Leadership? <br /><br />A. . Unfortunately, no, the Leadership elements do not believe it would be fair to meet with some potential SE&amp;I contractors individually, but not all. While Program Office personnel routinely meet with contractors who do business with the Wing on program matters, we recognize that some of them may be potential offerors on the SE&amp;I solicitation. In all such cases, Program Office and Center Leadership will not discuss the SE&amp;I source selection or the desired SE&amp;I contractor capabilities. In addition, during our next Industry Day, there will be another opportunity for contractors to meet one on one with members of the government team.</p>
<p><br />Q. When will the contract be awarded? Is there a time limit?</p>
<p>A. The ISSW needs SE&amp;I capabilities that only a qualified contractor can provide as soon as possible. There is some overlap between the work currently provided by the SETA contractor on a labor hours basis and the work that will be done by the SE&amp;I contractor, so a transition period is anticipated. The current SETA contract expires on December 31, 2009.</p>
<p><br />_______________________________________________________________________________<br />Please email your responses within 2 weeks if possible to Elizabeth Chirdon in a word document. (elizabeth.chirdon@losangeles.af.mil)</p>
<p>Also feel free to email questions at any time before the source selection begins and the government will answer questions to the greatest degree possible on FedBizOps.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source due to a unique capability provided, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>The US Army CECOM Contracting Center  Army Contracting Command, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5000, intends to issue a sole source award for spare parts for the AN/TPQ-36(V) AND AN/TWP-37(V) Operations Control Group of the Firefinder Radar System, to GarrettCom, Inc. of Fremont, CA.  The Government does not possess all of the detailed design information or specifications that any source, other than GarrettCom, would need in order to produce spare parts for the Firefinder System that meet the Governments form, fit, and function requirements. GarretComs proprietary data, to include drawings, software, source codes, and test and calibration procedures, is needed to assure interoperability and interchangeability with Firefinder components that have been previously procured. Only GarrettCom possesses the unique knowledge of the Switch Electronic (NSN: 5865-01-565-3816) design and is the only source that can provide the required spare parts.  The intended resulting modification to contract W15P7T-09-P-W001 will be a purchase order of 95 Switch Electronics.  This action has an estimated value of $249,185.00.  This sole source procurement is authorized under FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and 10USC2304(c)(1).<BR><BR>The US Army, CECOM Contracting Center has established the IBOP website as part of the Armys Single Face to Industry.
