<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE.  Expeditionary Electrical Test Shop for the U.S. Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM).  This test set will include computerized test equipment, tools, adaptors, and any other necessary supplies to fully test and verify the operational condition of electrical system components from a wide variety of USMC tactical and non-tactical ground vehicles and equipment. The electrical system components that require testing include alternators, starters, generators, and regulators. Currently, it is anticipated that the set will take advantage of commercially available testers to simultaneously load test both alternators and starters. The set is anticipated to include separate load testers for alternators and starters. Generator testing is anticipated to take place on the alternator test machine. Regulator testing is anticipated to take place by exchanging the regulator under test for a known good regulator and re-testing the alternator.  To meet deployment and transportation requirements, this test set will be fully integrated into a one-side hard-skinned expandable steel shelter meeting ISO 1C standards (8 width x 8 height x 20 length). No canvas or other soft-sided expansions will be allowed. This shelter will also have an integral bale-arm and flatrack that will allow the shelter to be loaded and unloaded using the Load Handling System of the LVSR. The shelter will be certified safe to ship by the Coast Guard or an authorized approval entity. Additionally, the shelter will have integrated spreader bars and forklift pockets in order to take full advantage of all material handling equipment in use by the USMC. It is an objective for the gross mass of the set to be below 15,000 pounds.<BR>The test set will include input connections for Mobile Electric Power (MEP) units and Environmental Control Units (ECU) found in the USMC inventory. All other systems/connections required for the operation of the test equipment (e.g. pneumatic, water/cooling, venting, etc.) will be included as part of the set and self-contained. The test set will also include work benches, cabinets with drawers, and shelving for the storage of tools, adaptors, etc. during transport with securing provisions. Where applicable, drawers will include foam with color contrasting cutouts for the inventory control of stored items, including the tool load and test adaptors. All components of the test set will be supplied by the contractor. All components will be new and unused. It is also required that a full Pro/Engineer native 3D model of the test set and a commercial Technical Manual with a provisioning parts list be delivered to the government. In addition to the expeditionary test set, the government desires the ability to purchase the test set without the shelter, for installation into a garrison facility. <BR>Solicitation is for a 5-year requirements type contract.  Full and open competition.  ESTIMATED ISSUE DATE OF SOLICITATION IS 23 NOV 2009.  This solicitation will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.501 and 5.102, therefore hardcopies will not be provided.  Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the internet:<BR>https://aais.ria.army.mil/AAIS/Solinfo/index.htm. CAUTION: This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto. Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is in fact unable to maintain a bidders mailing list. It is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the above internet address in order to obtain any said amendments which may be issued. Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for bid opening/receipt of proposals may render your bid or proposal non-responsive and result in the rejection of the same.<BR>

<a href="mailto:Lizette.M.Kummer@nasa.gov">Lizette M Kummer</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>Background and RFI Summary:The mission of NASA is to achieve the U.S. Space Exploration Policy by implementing asustained and affordable human and robotic space program; extending human presence acrossthe solar system and beyond; and developing supporting innovative technologies,knowledge, and infrastructures.  The Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS)initially defined a transportation system and the study is available at:http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/exploration/news/ESAS_report.html	.The Propulsion and Cryogenics Advanced Development Project (PCAD) within the ExplorationTechnology Development Program (ETDP) is evaluating, assessing, and advancing propulsiontechnologies for the Constellation Program.  The PCAD web link is:http://spaceflightsystems.grc.nasa.gov/Advanced/Capabilities/PCAD/     .This Request for Information (RFI) seeks market information for planning purposes onavailable technologies for cryogenic valves capable of long duration exposure to spaceenvironments. As NASA prepares to move beyond low earth orbit and return to a mission ofexploration, cryogenic valves need to become more robust, durable, and hardened. Themajority of space craft that are exposed to the space environments for a long durationutilize storable propellant systems. These systems typically use elastomeric materialssuch as Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM), Viton, or Kelrez. However, thesematerials do not work in cryogenic applications. Previous missions were limited to a fewdays and those also utilized storable propellants. NASA's experience with theInternational Space Station (ISS) shows us some of the issues resulting from long termspace exposure, and long product life cycles, while still maintaining lightweightcomponents.  However, ISS components are generally not cryogenic nor propulsion related. All standard cryogenic fluid controls utilized in propulsion systems today are focused onlaunch vehicles with minutes of life, unmanned scientific satellites with longer life butnot man-rated, and a few space station applications where crew rescue or resupply ispossible within days, or weeks. Once humans settle on the moon, Mars, or other planets,such rescues or resupplies may be difficult or impossible.  The crew must have robust andreliable propulsion systems that can work, and work when needed. Space craft used forthese exploration missions need the highest level of reliability, and systems that offerredundancy, without adding grossly to their weight.Specific Information Requested: The RFI seeks technologies that are at a low (2-4) Technology Readiness Level (TRL - SeeAppendix B attached) and could be applied to the standard cryogenic fluid controlsutilized in propulsion systems today to improve their performance over existingtechnologies. NASA is seeking information on candidate cryogenic valve systems that could potentiallybe used on Advanced Propulsion and Space Systems. An advanced valve development effort ison-going and this RFI will be used to identify valve technologies that may be used inflight as well as on the ground to improve the reliability, mass, and packaging of thesesystems and to provide synergies between vehicle and propulsion elements, therebyimproving the vehicle's overall performance.Specific Information on the Mission:This RFI assumes that the propulsion system will be launched in an inert state to lowearth orbit, stay on orbit for up to a month, be transported to another orbit over a fourday period, and finally enter  that orbit. The system must be activated in orbit toprovide landing abort as the vehicle descends to the surface for a 6 month stay. At theend of that time the system must be activated and used to propel the crew off the surfaceand rendezvous with the orbiting vehicle. While in low earth orbit, exposure to long thermal cycles from -250 Deg F to + 250 Deg Fis typical at time frequencies of once every 90 minutes. So a total thermal cycle countof over 4000 cycles is planned and components will need to be qualified to 4 times thatduration or 16,000 thermal cycles. In transient environments there will be thermal soak temperatures as low as minus 388 DegF (-234 Deg C, no illumination) to as high as 302 Deg F (150 Deg C, direct illumination)for 4 days. On average, surface temperature cycles will vary from minus 238 Deg F (-150 Deg C) to 302Deg F (150 Deg C) over the course of 30 earth days for the 6 month stay time.  Thistranslates into approximately 6 thermal cycles for a nominal mission.  However, dependingon the landing location, temperature can be as low as minus 388 Deg F and remain therefor the entire duration of mission.  During this whole period radiation from solarflares, exposure to unfiltered sunlight and cosmic rays are typical. Valve assemblieswill require hardening from this environment and ability to survive and provide reliableoperation. Appendix A (attached) contains a top level specification for a typical ascentmotor engine valve.The typical propellants may include cryogenic liquid oxygen and methane, but othercryogenic fuels could be utilized. Typical systems would operate in the 200 to 500 psigrange, and will require valves in the approximate 1.5 to 3 inch equivalent orifice size. Actuation should provide rapid and repeatable response in the 100 to 200 msec time frame.Actuator configuration is not defined, but position control is not typically needed.Mass, reliability, and total system impacts are prime areas of concern. The need toprovide robust designs at the minimum of weight, control, power, and maintain thatrobustness until launch at the end of this mission is critical. Preliminary Test Data and RFI Goals:NASA has undertaken a project to take a typical propulsion system valve and expose thatvalve to the environments above. The valve is a pneumatically operated ball valvedesigned for an air launched vehicle with a suborbital flight path. It was chosen as itsheritage was to the Centaur program, a well known cryogenic in-space propulsion system.The testing showed several issues. 1)	The seals in the actuator leaked at over 100 SCCM as temperatures were loweredfor long periods of time (less than a day). The goal is to achieve rotary seal leakagesas low as 5-10 SCCM over this mission profile.2)	The actuator and pilot valve response times increased to the point that the valvewas not operating reliably and would have adversely affected an engines ability to start.The goal is to provide at least 30% force margin to actuation loads at the end of thismission. Actuator minimum required torque is 2000 in-lbs at minimum motive power (lowestvoltage, lowest pressure, etc.) With 30% margin required at low end so 2600 in-lbsminimum required. 3)	Seal friction increased and the breakaway torque requirements exceeded theactuators capability as the temperature dropped. The goal is to reduce seal frictions by25%. This can be included in actuator margin or directly as in improvement of staticfriction compared to Teflon on bare stainless steel.4)	The pilot valve leakage became unacceptable (blowing leaks) as the temperaturedropped to -160 Deg F. The goal is to achieve seat and static seal leakages as low as5-10 SCCM over this mission profile.Continued testing is ongoing and data will be provided to the vendors as it becomesavailable.Vendor Information Required:NASA requests that industry provide information on potential valve designs, seals,actuators, materials, or any other relevant technologies that can be utilized to meet orimprove propulsion valve reliability, mass, and power requirements. The information provided should provide technical description of the technology, outlinethe basic assumed problem being resolved, and define how this approach will resolve theissue. Ideas for new valve technologies to be tested resulting from this RFI fall into twocategories: 1.	Technologies that could be tested in the existing NASA valve must be able to beintegrated onto the existing test fixture or test valve and proven through the sametesting series currently being performed for the existing cryogenic valve. Information onthe valve and test conditions can be provided upon request. 2.	For technologies that could not be easily tested in or are not applicable to theexisting NASA valve, the vendor must suggest testing that will allow NASA to provide anindependent assessment of the technology performance.Response Instructions:It is emphasized that this RFI is for information and planning purposes only. Release ofthis RFI is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into acontractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.

<p>The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334510 and the business size standard is 500 employees. This is a firm fixed price acquisition. The period of performance is twelve months and place of performance is in Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
<p>The NINDS Clinical Neurocardiology Section (CNS) develops and applies methods for assessing functions of central and peripheral catecholamine systems and coordination of these systems with other homeostatic systems in health, stress, and disease. The current research focus of the Section is on biomarkers and mechanisms of loss of catecholaminergic neurons in Parkinson disease and related disorders. The research includes clinical diagnostic evaluations of patients with known or suspected disorders of the sympathetic nervous system, adrenomedullary hormonal system, or synthesis, release, reuptake, metabolism, or turnover of catecholamines. Our Section also carries out collaborative studies about catecholamine systems and clinical diagnostic testing under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA). Such research and clinical assessments require means to measure levels of catecholamines and related chemicals in body fluids such as plasma. To develop high throughput sensitive means to carry out these assays the NINDS-CNS uses a Waters Aquity/Quattro Premier LCMS system. The NINDS-CNS is in the process of developing novel and potentially important methods using this system.<br /><br />The Waters Aquity / Quattro Premier LCMS system absolutely requires scheduled as well as unscheduled service visits, equipment repair and replacements, software and hardware upgrades, and online technical support. Therefore the NINDS-CNS needs to have a Waters Total Assurance Plan to obtain the services to the existing system in the NINDS-CNS laboratory. The Waters Aquity / Quattro Premier LCMS system is a proprietary product from Waters Corp. The required services as listed are provided by Waters Corp engineers and are not available from any other sources.</p>

<DESC>The National Park Service, Isle Royale National Park, intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract for Memcor XP-6  water treatment plant in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(C) (1) to Siemens Water Technologies Corp. The National Park Service follows US Environmental Protection Agency (USPEA) requirements for its drinking water systems.  The USPEA has delegated the drinking water certification jurisdiction to the State of Michigan.
Siemens Water Technologies Corp. is the only company that holds a certificate for drinking water treatment membrane for the state of Michigan. 
THE FOLLOWING JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION IS PROVIDED IAW FAR:
JUSTIFICATION FOR NON-COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT FORWINDIGO MEMBRANE DRINKING WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM
Upon the basis of the following justification for non-competitive procurement, theproject described below may be negotiated without providing for full and opencompetition pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), as implemented by the FederalAcquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (2), when the supplies are available fromonly one responsible source.
JUSTIFICATION
1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:Contracting Office, National Park Service,, Ohio Major Acquisition Buying Office, 15610 Vaughn Rd Brecksville, Ohio 44141; for Isle Royale National Park, 800 East Lakeshore Drive, Houghton, Michigan, 49931-1895.
2. STATUTORY AUTHORITY:
Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), as implemented by Federal AcquisitionRegulation (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source will satisfy requirements.
3. NATURE AND DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED:
This justification seeks approval using other than full and open competition toaward a sole source, firm fixed price contract to Siemens Water Technologies,ATTN: Russ Davis, 1812 Fargo Blvd, Geneva, IL, 60134, for the procurement ofone (1) Memcor XP-6 Water Treatment Plant and appurtenances.
4. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES AND SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEETTHE AGENCY'S NEED:  
The Park must obtain this membrane water treatment system to replace the existing outdated water treatment system currently in use at Windigo. The estimated costs for this project is $210,000.00.  The existing system is unable to meet the treatment requirements of the State of Michigan. The proposed membrane water treatment system is a complete, factory designed and tested, skid mounted, membrane water treatment system with more than 10 years of operation and production including a backwashing system using air, chlorine, and acid membrane cleaning system to routinely restore the membrane treatment capacity. The system has been in productionfor more than 10 years and is manufactured by a company with more than 10 years of production experience of similar systems.
5. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITIONREQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED: 
No other company manufactures a system having all of the followingrequirements;
1. The National Park Service follows US Environmental ProtectionAgency (USEPA) requirements for it drinking water systems. Systemupgrades and modifications are required to be reviewed and approvedby the appropriate USEPA office having jurisdiction over the specificwater system. In most cases, USEPA has delegated this responsibilityto the states through a process that gives the states "primacy" inenforcing USEPA drinking water requirements. Michigan has beengiven primacy by the USEPA. This means that the drinking watersystem modifications at Windigo, will require approval from the state ofMichigan.
2. Only two membrane treatment units are approved by the state ofMichigan for drinking water treatment-Siemens' Memcor systems andGeneral Electric's Homespring Central Water Purifier individualmembrane units. Obtaining approval from the state of Michigan for adrinking water membrane treatment system involves obtaining NationalSanitation Foundation (NSF) approval. Once this approval is obtainedthe system needs to document the performance of the treatment plantitself through either a pilot test or from documented use elsewhere oncold surface water similar to Lake Superior surface water. ChuckThomas, Michigan Department of Environmental Quality explained thatthe city of Marquette, MI went through this process for the SiemensMemcor system and they were required to run the pilot study for sixmonths. Chuck mentioned that there are additional approvalrequirements for the rest of the system, in addition to the membraneportion and its demonstrated effectiveness, such as integrity testing.To run a pilot test, it is necessary to rent or purchase the treatmentequipment, install it somewhere, and run it for the required time frame.There is no guarantee that the tested equipment will be approved atthe conclusion of the pilot test.
NOTE ON OTHER GE PRODUCTS: GE does make packagemembrane filtration plants for surface water. These are their Zenon ZBoxsystems. These systems are rated for smaller flow rates up tovery larger flow rates. Their literature indicates that the smallestavailable might just be small enough to work at Windigo. HOWEVER,THESE SYSTEMS ARE NOT APPROVED FOR SURFACE WATERUSE IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. Since they are not approved,they cannot be installed and used at Windigo.  
3. Of the two Michigan approved systems, only the Memcor systemincludes the complete skid mounted system designed and tested bythe manufacturer. The Memcor system is a completely engineered, designed, and tested system that includes the membrane units, plus;
a. bachwashing equipment that includes multiple backwashing modes/chemical systems
b. electronic controls and operating software that automatically
i. adjusts flowrates, backwash modes, membrane operatingpressures
i. monitors influent and effluent turbidity (i.e. water quality)iii. logs the operating data on the computer for futurereference, trend analysis, and trouble shooting
c. pumps to pump raw water through system at correct rate basedon controls and to backwash the system at the correct rates
d. air compressor that provides correct air amounts during certainbackwashing process as called for by the system controls
e. flowrate, pressure, and turbidity sensors
f..properly sized automatic valves and flow controls.  Memcor systems are preconfigured based on required system flow rates and water quality.The preconfigured Memcor systems are available for flow rates as low as20 gallons per minute or so, up to many hundreds of gallons per minute.Homespring systems are standalone membrane modules with limitedbackwash flushing capability (no chemicals are used), are designed,primarily for home use, and operate at a rate of only 4.5 gallons perminute.  No provision is made for air surging, or the use of acid or chlorine use inthe backwash, as is provided by the Memcor system. (The moreadvanced Memcor backwashing helps to ensure longer membrane lifeand lower operating cost and is also generally provided by othermanufacturer's of larger membrane treatment systems.)
To utilize the Homespring system someone will need to engineer, designand test the various additional components already provided in theMemcor system, so that the Homespring can be utilized for our water plantat Windigo. Operating software would need to be written or adapted fromexisting software. The engineered Homespring system would require thatmultiple Homespring units be connected together somehow to provide thecapacity required for this project.
No engineering, design, or testing will be needed for the Memcor system,other than to select a flowrate and identify to the manufacturer that thewater source will be Lake Superior surface water.Since the Memcor system is a standard and complete package rather thanbeing custom designed (as required for Homespring) the variouscomponents can be expected to work properly together.  Also, since the Memcor system has been designed and manufactured by one company, Siemens, ongoing technical support in the way of training,troubleshooting, and software updates is readily available from a single experienced and comprehensive source
4. A very similar Memcor membrane system has been operatingsatisfactorily for more than 3 years at the ISRO Mott Island watertreatment plant, while continuing to meet Michigan State finished watertreatment requirements.
5. Siemens Water Technologies is one of the few membrane systemmanufacturers that make systems for smaller water systems. A slightlylarger system is likely to be used at MORU in the near future. Designof that system is currently being done by HDR. During the valueanalysis portion of the MORU project, the Memcor system wasidentified as the least cost membrane treatment option.
6. Purchase of a Memcor system for the Windigo water treatment plantwill reduce maintenance costs by;
a. allowing many of the Mott Island in stock spare parts to be usedfor the new Windigo membrane treatment plant, since many ofthe parts will be interchangeable.  
b. reducing operator training costs by allowing the existing MottIsland water system operator to train the Windigo water systemoperator.
c. allowing the Windigo and Mott Island water system operators towork on the other system should one of them be unavailabledue to illness, leave, vacation, etc.
6. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARESOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS PRACTICABLE:
As required by FAR Subpart 5.202 a synopsis and the justification for this action will be published on the Federal Business Opportunities website.
7. OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL ANDOPEN COMPETITION:
Due to the remote nature of ISRO and its limited accessibility that can be madeworse at any time due to bad weather, purchasing a membrane treatment systemsimilar to the existing Mott Island system will help to ensure sustained, reliable,and safe drinking water is available for the park staff and visitors.
8. DETERMINATION THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THEGOVERNMENT BE FAIR AND REASONABLE:
The Contracting Officer, with the expertise of technical personnel will determinethat the cost to the Government is fair and reasonable. The estimated cost is$210,000.00.
9. REMOVAL OF COMPETITION BARRIERS FROM SUBSEQUENTACQUISITION:
Public utilities, to include drinking water, are regulated by the state government; no alternatives exist to remove these barriers.
10. CONCLUSION:
Based on the foregoing, it is determined to be in the best interest of theGovernment to procure the membrane water treatment system from SiemensWater Technologies.
I certify all support data, which forms the basis for this justification, is completeand accurate.
Signed original document on file at the Ohio Major Acquisition Buying Office.

Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract with Honeywell International Inc. - DBA Phoenix Support Center 21640 North 12th Avenue, Phoenix, AZ  85027.  The FFP contract will cover a 60-month period of performance for an effort to provide repairs for the K/H/C-130J Flight Management System (FMS) components to include the V9507907 Communication, Navigation Identification Management Unit (CNIMU), V9513910 Integrated Control Display Unit (ICDU), 8503419-921 Communication, Navigation Identification Signal Processor (CNISP), and 8519600-923 Automatic Flight Control Processor (AFCP)/ Digital Auto Flight Director (DAFD) in support of the C-130J type/ Model/ Series (T/M/S) and derivative aircraft (i.e. KC - 130J and HC - 130J) programs.  This requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY: The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design and Construction Excellence in Public Buildings, GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project.
<p>Project Summary: GSA announces an opportunity for Design and Construction Excellence in public architecture, engineering and construction through a Design-Build contract. The project shall be performed in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements for a New Tier III Data Center (Data Center) at the Denver Federal Center (DFC), Lakewood, Colorado. The Data Center is classified as a Tier III facility as defined by the Uptime Institute Tier Level Classification System. The work will be performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The Data Center will be two stories high with a mechanical basement and will be built in phases using the Performance Optimized Datacenter (POD) concept. Phase One is the current building project, including core and shell and infrastructure to support the first POD Phase. When complete, the project will contain its own perimeter security system and parking for 2 cars on-site and 20 existing off-site, adjacent to the site. The completed two-story building with mechanical basement will encompass approximately 140,000 Gross Square Feet. As required by law, the facility will meet federal energy goals and all federal accessibility requirements and standards. The project goal will meet LEED-Silver rating requirements. The GSA is the lead agency for the delivery of this facility</p>
<p>As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA's P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). All GSA projects must achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating with specific credits required.</p>
<p>The New Data Center will be located in a prominent position on the DFC at the corner of First Street and North Center Avenue, Lakewood, Colorado.</p>
<p>Prospective Offerors' experience must include, but is not limited to, work performed on data centers or projects of similar complexity.</p>
<p>The estimated cost for the design-build delivery of the Data Center and related infrastructure upgrades is between $65,000,000 and $80,000,000.</p>
<p>The design-build scope of work includes architectural, engineering, construction, security, commissioning and other related services necessary to construct the new Data Center. Related services include but are not limited to, site planning and infrastructure, geotechnical evaluation and monitoring, permitting, testing and inspection during construction, commissioning and potential additional requirements.</p>
<p>Procurement Strategy: GSA intends to award a firm-fixed price Design-Build Contract for the Tier III Data Center at the DFC based upon 35% bridging documents and Program of Requirements which will be provided with the Request for Proposal during Phase Two of the acquisition process for this procurement pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The five most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. For this RFP, technical evaluation factors, when combined, will be significantly more important than price. The importance of price will increase if Offerors' non-pricing proposal factors are considered essentially equal in terms of quality or if price is so high or low as to significantly diminish the value of a proposal's technical superiority to the government. The award may be made without negotiation of proposals. Therefore, offerors will be requested to initially submit proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.</p>
<p>The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about September 23, 2009 on the internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.</p>
<p>Opportunities for other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable. In this procurement, GSA intends to promote contractors' and subcontractors' use of registered Apprenticeship Programs.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. The Governments decision regarding whether or not to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.

In the event that a potential offeror fails to provide specific rental rate or other required information as part of its response to this advertisement, the Government reserves the right to assume that the potential building in question cannot meet the Governments requirements.  With specific respect to expected rental rate information, the Government will assume the maximum rental rate authorized in the applicable lease prospectus related to this requirement in the event the respondent fails to include such information.

Occupancy Date:  Space must be ready for occupancy and delivered to the Government no later than February 24, 2010.

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): OCCI, INC. W912DQ-09-C-1035<br><br>Due to the location of the additional weld repair work to be completed on the Intake Gates of the Hydraulic Steel Structure within the Stockton Dam Power Plant, there is no way to get another contractor into the area while the current Contractor completes the work without severely impacting safety and the schedule.  Safety concerns are related to having several contractors in a confined space, wearing hose-supplied air breathing apparatus that may get tangled with other equipment. The schedule concerns are related to the sequential implementation of the weld repairs prior to painting within each gate.  The current contract calls for painting of the Hydraulic Steel Structure, this modification would require removal of additional paint, welding work on the Intake Gate and additional painting.

<p>***Please do not contact contracts office***</p>
<p>Proposal Submission Place:<br />Mr. Berik Z. Tolumbayev, Acting General Director<br />KMG Transcaspian LLP, 6 Saryarka Ave.<br />Business Center "Arnan", 7th Floor, Office 735<br />Astana 010000, Kazakhstan, +7 (7172) 79 30 99</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to perform technical assistance to</p>
<p>a) assist KMG Transcaspian LLP in defining the International Treaty Accessions, Maritime laws and Regulations that Kazakhstan has to implement and to, <br />b) establish a definition of how these requirements should be implemented.</p>
<p>Kazakh crude oil is currently shipped in limited amounts of approximately 150,000 barrels per day across the Caspian Sea from the Port of Aktau, currently the only major seaport in Kazakhstan to Azerbaijan. Over the next 10 years however, Kazakhstan is expected to dramatically increase oil production, from its current capacity of approximately 70 million tons per year to an estimated 120 million tons per year by 2019. Most of this oil will be exported, necessitating an expansion of Kazakhstan's oil export infrastructure. The Republic of Kazakhstan (RK) has prioritized the development of KCTS (Kazakhstan Caspian Transportation System) and in particular the part of KCTS - Transcaspian project (TCP), to ensure that Kazakhstan's oil export infrastructure can accommodate rising production levels. Initially, the Trans Caspian System (TCS) is expected to allow Kazakhstan to deliver approximately 500,000 barrels of oil per day directly to Azerbaijan via surface shipments across the Caspian Sea for onward transmission through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, other pipelines are also allowed but beyond the frame of Agreement. This volume is expected to increase to approximately 750,000 to 1.2 million barrels per day when KCTS is fully operational. Improving the safety and environmental management of Caspian Sea ship traffic through improved maritime laws and regulations inspire confidence in TCP. In addition to Aktau, the RK plans to develop the Port of Kuryk as a marine oil loading and transport terminal. Eventually, the RK believes that the majority of oil exported from Kazakhstan via the Caspian will pass through Kuryk rather than Aktau. <br />The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $327,844 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM (GMT +6) will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM (GMT+6) will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.

<DESC>Sources Sought/Request for InformationTHIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL/QUOTETITLE: Parts and Repair Ordering System Services (PROS) IVSources Sought Parts and Repair Ordering System IV (PROS IV) NOTE: 1. INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) at Wright-Patterson AFB OH,  is responsible for providing comprehensive logistic support to approximately 100 foreign partners.  Eligible countries own and operate over 11,000 aging aircraft of various configurations and associated support equipment of U.S. origin. This support includes acquiring non-standard and hard-to-support standard supplies, maintenance support and technical services for these partners through the DOD Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process and determining price fair and reasonable on all procurements IAW the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR 15.403).  Contractor will be responsible for meeting requirements in the Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) (DOD 5105.38-M), and Air Force Manual 23-110, International Traffic and Arms Regulation (ITAR) and the Arms Export Control Act (AECA).   The PROS contract is a Tri-Se! rvice program designed to acquire procurement services to meet the needs of our FMS Air Force, Navy and Army partners.  North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code of 541614, (Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services) governs this acquisition with a size standard of $7M for small business.Contract Effort Description: This contract effort provides a means for our FMS partners to receive sustainment support for the procurement and maintenance of non-standard and hard-to-support standard items and associated services.  The PROS program office currently uses an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to procure non-standard and, to a lesser extent, hard-to-support standard commodities in support of foreign military partners.  Some of these material purchases have included installation and familiarization training and if required, individual Task Orders (TO) have been negotiated and awarded to accomplish these efforts.  The PROS contractor is also responsible for procuring repair capabilities of military items owned by foreign partners. The PROS contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC.  This PROS office oversees contractor performance through continuous oversight and quarterly reviews of the contractor's files and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor.  The program office is considering either an incentive fee or fixed fee to reward exceptional procurement performance based on criteria negotiated with the PROS contractor and annotated during these quarterly reviews. The majority of the current contract value is based on sub-contractors actual material costs passed-through to the PROS contractor for the acquisition of goods and services. The contractor earns a fill fee for each acquisition performed.  It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDR) submitted by the foreign partners for discrepancies noted in receipt of goods or services throughout the contract period and will include SDRs filed up to one year after the last requisition shipment.  We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution weighing cost and risk. Capability or Performance: PROS supply and maintenance requirements correspond to functions currently performed by DOD depots.  Responsibilities/services include but are not limited to: 
Item identification for program eligibility Past procurement reviewTech data reviewVendor base analysisPrice and availability informationDetermination of price fair and reasonableness IAW FARItem acquisition and/or maintenance including vendor selectionInvoicing and payment processingConfiguration coordination and controlInspection and acceptanceSupply Deficiency Reporting (SDR) interfaceVendor qualificationWarranties and warranty administration Packaging and handlingTransportationSAMIS interfaceResearch Catalogs (Haystack, Fedlog, D043 etc)
The PROS IV contract will provide the flexibility needed to allow the contractor to acquire logistical and technical support services meeting the country's demand for cost effective, timely, and quality support.   
These contract/contracts will consist of a two-year (2) basic with three (3) one-year options.  The estimated total contract value for the basic and option years, if exercised are $1 billion dollars.  
This sources sought synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the US Government.
Capabilities Package:  All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines the firm's capabilities in providing the required services.  Contractor is required to provide a high level explanation for the operation and management of the required services.  The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements.  RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 17 DEC 2009.

<CONTACT>Lloyd S. Blackwell, Phone 202-366-9564, Email lloyd.blackwell@nhtsa.dot.gov
<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  The purpose of this Notice is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.  The NHTSA welcomes Corporate Capability Statements from all individuals and organizations.  The NHTSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NHTSAs use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of NHTSAs evaluation of the information received.  As a result of this Notice, the NHTSA may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP).  However, should such a requirement fail to materialize, no basis for claims against the NHTSA shall arise as a result of a response to this Notice.  
Scope:
The purpose of this procurement is to conduct cost studies of motor vehicle equipment and perform detailed engineering teardown analyses to provide definitive cost and weight estimates of this equipment.  The results will serve as the basis for NHTSAS evaluation of the costs, weights, and lead time impacts of proposed initiatives, and compliance with the performance requirements of existing regulations.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor shall be required to dismantle the systems and subsystems of the motor vehicle equipment under study for cost and weight analysis.

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

As general guidance, requirements shall include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:

Conduct Initial Project Briefing.  The Contractor shall be required to meet with the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) and other interested NHTSA personnel in Washington, DC at the Headquarters of the Department of Transportation/NHTSA within fourteen (14) calendar days.  This meeting will ensure the Contractor and the COTR have a common understanding of the project.  In addition, they will discuss the projects objectives, planned course of action, milestones/deliverables and resolve any differences between the Governments technical approach and the Contractors approach.

Conduct Vehicle Systems Analysis.  The Contractor shall be required to research and select the make-model vehicles that may be addressed in task orders could include passenger cars, light truck vehicles (pickup trucks, sports utility vehicles, and minivans) medium and heavy trucks, truck tractors, track trailers, motorcycles or low speed vehicles) that represent high volume models within each market class.  
 
Determine Sampling Plan for Teardown Cost Analysis.  The Contractor shall be required to develop a sampling plan of motor vehicles that have equipment related to the motor vehicle regulation being studied in order to determine the cost and weight attributed to that regulation.  The sample shall be developed based on task order specifications but will generally provide a variety of designs, manufacturers (both foreign and domestic), vehicle market classes, and vehicle sizes. In addition, instances may occur where a regulation affects more than one vehicle type; therefore, a separate sampling plan shall be developed for each vehicle type.  Furthermore, where motor vehicle models have equipment in place before the establishment of a regulatory requirement and are then modified in subsequent model years to meet the requirements, the sampling plan shall be made up of matched pre- and post-regulation models.  The sampling plan shall include also motor vehicle models that may be used as substitutes.  

The COTR shall review the recommended sample of motor vehicles and proposed substitutes and shall notify the Contractor in writing as to the sample selected for study.  The sample must be approved by the COTR before the Contractor can proceed.

The Contractor shall acquire the motor vehicle equipment from a variety of sources:  vehicles being tested by NHTSA or one of its Contractors, motor vehicle dealers, OEM manufacturers, Tier-1, 2, and 3 level suppliers, testing labs, salvage yards, or other sources.  In all instances, the equipment must be in the same condition as the original equipment at the time the motor vehicles were manufactured.

Conduct Motor Vehicle Equipment Teardown Cost and Weight Analysis.  The Contractor shall be required to acquire and perform a physical teardown of the motor vehicle equipment under study in the sampling plan into its most elemental parts.  This is necessary so that the Contractor can identify the process operation by which each elemental part is made in terms of:

	Labor minutes
	Direct materials and scrap
	Machine occupancy hours or stations times
	Machinery, equipment, and tooling utilized.

Using prevailing labor and material costs, the Contractor shall be required to determine the variable manufacturing costs and total manufacturing costs for each elemental part, component, subassembly, and complete assemblies that constitute each system under study.  The Activity Based Costing methodology shall be used to assign variable and fixed burden costs to each unit of an end product.  Specific cost elements that the Contractor shall be required to isolate and identify include the following:

	Direct labor dollars per unit (rates, union shops)
	Direct material costs and scrap allowance per unit
	Variable burden cost per unit, including indirect labor and other costs that vary with production volume
	Fixed burden per unit
	Capital investments required at prevailing annual sales volumes  property, plant, equipment, and tooling
	Depreciation schedules for property, plant, and equipment
	Amortization schedules for special tooling  

The Contractor shall be required to accumulate and reconcile variable manufacturing costs, fixed burden, capital investment, and weight data on the motor vehicle equipment under study.  For those components provided by outside suppliers, the Contractor shall be required to determine the price paid by the manufacturer where possible.  In the absence of supplier pricing data, the Contractor shall be required to determine the variable manufacturing cost for each purchased part by manufacturing process analysis and assume internal sourcing in the establishment of the manufacturers variable manufacturing costs.  The Contractor shall be required to determine the markup on variable manufacturing costs to supplier selling price.

The Contractor shall be required to provide detailed manufacturing process operation worksheets and/or computer printouts which clearly show how variable manufacturing costs, fixed burden, and weights are accumulated and reconciled from each part to its parts group and from parts group to the total system.

The Contractor shall be required to weigh and tag each component after teardown.  After determining material content and the manufacturing process and costs, the Contractor shall be required to appropriately identify and lay out the components and photograph them in such a manner that the component size in inches and/or centimeters can be determined from the photograph.    

Conduct Midterm Review.  The Contractor shall be required to conduct a briefing for NHTSA personnel describing the progress of the project.  The systems and subsystems dismantled for cost and weight analysis will be reviewed, along with the manufacturing processes developed for these units.  In support of the briefing, the Contractor shall be required to provide visual aids such as photographs, transparencies, display boards, and videos.  Therefore, the Contractor should have access to these capabilities, either in house or through a subcontractor/consultant.  

Prepare Monthly Progress Report.  The Contractor shall be required to furnish monthly progress reports electronically to the NHTSA COTR and/or TOM.  In addition, the Contractor shall be required to provide one original (hard copy) to the NHTSA Contract Specialist.  The monthly progress report shall be in Microsoft word format and may be delivered by regular mail.  At a minimum, the progress report shall include a narrative description of the following items:

	Accomplishments made during the reporting period.
	Funds status by major cost element, months obligations, cumulative obligations, estimated cost to complete, and percent of cost expended versus percent of completion.
	Plans for accomplishments in next reporting period.

<SUBJECT>RECOVERY-NEXT-GENERATION METAL-FORMABILITY TEST FACILITY 
<SOLNBR>AMD-09-SS28-1 
<RESPDATE>111609
<CONTACT>Janet M. Lamb, Phone 3019756205, Email janet.lamb@nist.gov - Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a next-generation metal-formability test facility to support the operations and research of the NIST Center for Metal Forming of the Metallurgy Division. The machine test facility will be used to characterize the stress-strain behavior of sheet metals subject to complicated strain paths. It will use innovative techniques to measure both stress and strain in the sheet. Stresses will be measured using x-ray diffraction, while local strains will be measured using digital image correlation. 

After NIST obtains and analyzes the results of this market research and develops specifications for a system that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If NIST identifies at least two qualified small businesses during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.

This contemplated procurement is anticipated to use Recovery Act Funding if it is determined that responsible sources can satisfy the requirements.

NIST has a need for a next-generation metal-formability test facility with four major capabilities:

(1) A geometry consisting of two sets of orthogonal, independently controlled servohydraulic actuators of 250 kN capacity capable of deforming a cruciform sheet specimen in plane without introducing torques. The sheet samples will be at least 51 cm in diameter. The specimen grips that connect the specimen to the actuators shall be capable of gripping a 15.25 cm wide specimen arm without wrinkling the sheet. 
(2) A biaxial extensometer system for measuring sheet specimen strain mechanically. 
(3) A residual-stress measurement system, based on x-ray diffraction, and associated control and analysis software for measuring the sheet specimen stress during the test, without removing the specimen from the test frame. The residual-stress measurement system shall be capable of measuring stresses in sheets during the of unspecified metals with 0.5 mm minimum thickness with acquisition times for each stress measurement less than 60 s.
(4) A strain-measurement system that employs stereoscopic digital-image correlation with accompanying software for measuring and analyzing specimen strains. The strain measurement system shall be capable of acquiring and saving a minimum of 10 stereoscopic image pairs at full resolution per second for a minimum of 50 s. Its spatial resolution shall be sufficient to make a minimum of 50 strain measurements evenly spaced over an area 6.5 mm by 25 mm and a minimum of 100 strain measurements evenly spaced over an area with 150 mm diameter, for each stereoscopic image pair.

NIST seeks responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334519, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or fewer. Please include your companys size classification in any response to this notice.

Companies that manufacture such systems are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to janet.lamb@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, please provide as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 
1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided.
2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).
3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems.
4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to todd.hill@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s).
5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above that the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

<DESC>SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
<p><br />Notice Number: HHS-NIH-NCI-SBSS-TSB-07009-65</p>
<p>Title: RECOVERY - Networks of Tissue Source Sites (TSS) Supporting NCI's The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Program</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this Notice and the draft Statement of Work to familiarize themselves with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a comprehensive, collaborative effort led by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of genome analysis technologies. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) launched TCGA as a 3-year pilot. The second phase of the project is to study at least 20 additional cancers over five (5) years. This project aims to systematically explore the entire spectrum of genomic changes involved in human cancer. This project is designed to comprehensively analyze DNA copy number changes, including large and small scale rearrangements, transcription profiles, epigenetic modifications, sequence variation, and sequence in both tumor tissue and case-matched germline DNA. To successfully generate comprehensive data, TCGA will acquire in excess of 40,000 biospecimens over the course of this project.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The purpose of this Small Business Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small business concerns including HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.

<DESC>Industry Day Announcement
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) in collaboration with the US Army will conduct a Competition (with a cash prizes for the winner/s) in order to foster the ability to clear training ranges of debris and unexploded ordnance (UXO) using robotic technologies. Experience to date with robotic range clearance suggests a significant potential for time and cost savings as well as increases in the safety for the personnel conducting this activity. The ultimate aim is to return to productive use the millions of acres currently encumbered with spent training rounds and debris. The Department of Defense (DoD) intends for this Competition to result in viable systems that can be procured and placed into service clearing ranges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the expressed industry interest and capability, the Competition event will be preceded by a qualification requirement. Competitors looking to compete for the cash prize must first demonstrate a viable robotic system capable of safely executing tasks inherent in clearing UXO ranges. Assuming a sufficient quantity of competitors qualify to participate in the Competition, the DoD will award $2M in cash prizes against the various competition categories and pursue a separate procurement contract to purchase robotic range clearance systems or services. Both the qualification trials and the Competition will be held at Camp Guernsey, WY.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Industry Day for the Competition will be held on Thursday, 10 December in Building 9706 at Tyndall AFB, FL. Information will be provided by DoD relating to the conduct of the Competition to include the provisional Rules and Metrics of the Competition, the follow on IDIQ contract, and robotic demonstrations related to UXO clearance. The agenda will include a Competition Overview, plans for the follow on IDIQ contract, a range clearance process overview, logistics information about Camp Guernsey, a review of the provisional Rules and Scoring Criteria associated with the Competition, robotic demonstrations related to UXO clearance, and a tour of AFRL Robotics Range Clearance systems. Space will also be provided if attendees would like to distribute information on their company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pre-registration is required by Thursday, 3 December, and can be done through the following website: www.roboticrangeclearance.com. Additional information including directions shall be provided through the website. Any questions should be directed through the website. Letters of Intent to compete in the Robotic Range Clearance Competition will be available at Industry Day and on the website. Letters of Intent are required in order to compete and must be submitted no later than close of business January 4th,2010."</p>

<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source contract under the authority of&nbsp;FAR 6.302-1. &nbsp;The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to award a sole source contract to Galisteo Consulting Group Incorporated, Albuquerque, New Mexico to conduct a follow-on study, grounded in a social sciences perspective, to explore methods and means to assess the "goodness" of computational social models and the limits and potentials of applying these methods and means in national security environments. The Galisteo Consulting Group's September 2008 study on the limits and potentials of computational social modeling will serve as the foundation from which to build. The objective of the study is to consider the limits, potentials, and best practices for those who fund and/or use computational social models in national security communities to assess the "goodness" of the models. Based on prior experience and a previous DTRA study in this area, Galisteo Consulting Group Incorporated will apply the required expert level social sciences-based integrated knowledge of computational social science models (to include their underlying qualitative social science theoretical bases); knowledge of national security decision making environments and how computational social models are currently used and assessed; and a demonstrated understanding of the issues surrounding the assessment of these models to meet the objective. The primary purpose of the effort is to objectively assist DTRA and others within the U.S. defense community in making informed decisions about future paths in investing additional resources into funding computational social science model development and/or using them to support decisions through a focused analysis of means and challenges to determine the "goodness" of a model. The delivery date is 18 months from the award of contract.&nbsp; All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

North- County Road 140/32nd Street

2. Rentable Square feet offered and rate per rentable square foot (specifying services and utilities included)

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, DELIVERY ORDER AGAINST GSA FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE GS23F0120P FOR ARCHITECT AND ENGINEERING FIRM TO DEVELOP A ARCHITECTURAL AND ENGINEERING CONCEPT DESIGN, DESIGN NARRATIVE, CONCEPT SPECIFICATION, CONCEPT COST ESTIMATE AND UPDATED PROGRAM OF REQUREMENTS FOR THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATOMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (NOAA), ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY COMPUTING CENTER (NESCC), A LARGE SCALE SUPERCOMPUTER DATA CENTER FACILITY.<br /><br />DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (ARRA), PUBLIC LAW 111-5. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO X-NTH INCORPORATED, 2601 WESTHALL LANE, MAITLAND, FL 32751, UNDER GSA SCHEDULE GS23F0120P.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, posts this notice of intent to issue a delivery order to X-NTH Incorporated, of Maitland, FL against GSA Schedule GS23F0120P for the development of an Architectural and Engineering Concept Design, Design Narrative, Concept Specifications, Concept Cost Estimate and to update the Program of Requirements for the NOAA Environmental Security Computing Center (NESCC), a large scale supercomputer data center facility. NOAA's goal is to commence operation in the NESCC in 2011.</p>
<p>In May 2009, NOAA awarded a delivery order, number WC1330-09-NC-1177, through competitive process, to X-NTH Incorporated against GSA Schedule GS23F120P. X-NTH Incorporated was tasked to develop an architectural and engineering Program of Requirements and cost estimate for the NESCC. X-NTH Incorporated delivered the Program of Requirements dated September 30, 2009. The current requirement for the development of the conceptual design and updating of the Program of Requirements is essentially follow-on work to that X-NTH Incorporated performed on delivery order WC1330-09-NC-1177. The information X-NTH Incorporated gathered from the research they conducted to produce the Program of Requirements is an essential component for expediting the development of the conceptual design package, updating the Program of Requirements and meeting the schedule for operation deployment in 2011. To consider sources other than X-NTH Incorporated would be inefficient and could compromise the Government's ability to meet the operation deployment schedule. A Contractor other than X-NTH Incorporated would need additional time to acquire the knowledge necessary to fully understand the Government's requirements to the point that they could begin work on developing the conceptual design and updating the Program of Requirements. Thus it is in the Government's best interest to acquire the follow-on work from X-NTH Incorporated.<br /><br />This Concept Design is required to provide an entry level design for the purposes of procuring a Developer/Contractor to build out a facility to meet NOAA's High Performance Computing needs. The estimated value of this action is approximately $400,000.00. The scope of this delivery order falls into two phases, Concept Design and Supplemental Engineering Services. The description of task objectives will be conducted in two phases as follows:</p>
<p>Phase One: Concept Design</p>
<p>The Contractor shall develop a Concept Design to include Concept Drawings, Concept Specifications, a Design Narrative, Concept Cost Estimate, and update the Program of Requirements dated 09/30/2009.</p>
<p>Phase Two: Supplemental Professional Engineering Services</p>
<p>In addition to providing Concept Design, NOAA requires the Contractor to provide Architect/Engineering (AE) and specialized technical services on an as needed basis over a period of six months. The Contractor shall provide professional engineering services to assist the Government in resolving any technical issues and in performing special design analysis.</p>
<p>This notice is for full disclosure compliance and announcement of potential subcontracting opportunities only. No competitive solicitation package is available, and no offers will be accepted from any source other than X-NTH Incorporated, 2601 Westhall Lane, Maitland, FL 32751, Telephone: (407) 660-0088.</p>

<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is undertaking a public data dissemination initiative to provide increased transparency of government operations and information by making data available directly to the public on an expedited basis.  Under this initiative the USPTO intends to award a no cost, sole source contract to Google, Inc using the authority set forth in the Patent and Trademark Office Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/ptag.pdf.  

The PTAG authorized the UPSTO to acquire products and services using maximum reasonable competition instead of full and open competition when possible on all acquisitions.   However, the USPTO will use competition as a principal tool in achieving results and intends to adopt means of affording competition that it determines will effectually serve the performance goals established for particular acquisitions.  Under PTAG the USPTO is exempt from the requirement to meet the test of ''full and open competition'' as defined in FAR Part 6, and may also utilize a streamlined contract approach to solicit and award contracts to the most highly qualified contractor.  In addition, the PTAG provides greater flexibility in the identification of sources and exempts the USPTO from portions of FAR part 15.

Accordingly, this synopsis serves as notice of the intent of the USPTO to award a no cost, sole source contract to Google, Inc. for public data dissemination services.  Google possesses the proven technology, ease of use, and an existing public repository for patents information without incurring any cost to the public.  This no cost, sole source contract award will serve as a bridge to provide immediate capability and availability to enable compliance with all governmental mandates and directives for transparency of governmental data. 

The USPTO will continue to develop an acquisition strategy under the previously posted RFI (SS-PAPT-09-10008) using competition to the maximum extent possible for establishing a long-term no cost solution to public data dissemination and transparency of governmental data.

<SOLNBR>S10-072
<RESPDATE>120409
<ARCHDATE>12312009
<CONTACT>Howard R. Souder, Jr., Subcontracts Specialist, Phone 301-846-5096, Fax 301-228-4037, Email souderhr@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>Project: Production of a Chimeric Monoclonal Antibody IgG1&kappa; in a Hollow Fiber Bioreactor
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>A monoclonal antibody has been developed as an immunotherapy treatment of primary amyloidosis in humans. This antibody is directed against the fibrillar deposits formed from the disease in vital tissues as the disease progresses. This antibody is a chimeric IgG1&kappa;. The requirement for the antibody is development and production to support toxicology studies and Phase I clinical trials. The specified production technology for clinical grade material would be at a GMP biopharmaceutical production facility that can produce this antibody in a hollow fiber bioreactor.</p>
<p>2. PROJECT SUMMARY</p>
<p>An adherent dhfr- CHO cell line from a MCB supplied by the BDP will be scaled up in cell culture vessels to obtain enough cells to inoculate 1 or more cultureware sets for a hollow fiber bioreactor. More then 1 bioreactor may be needed to produce a required 140 grams of bulk bioreactor harvest. The crude harvest will be packaged in bottles and frozen for storage until delivered to SAIC-F. An End of Production cell bank will be required.</p>
<p><br />3. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>A. Project Management Plan</p>
<p>The Subcontractor will be required to submit a Project Management Plan (PMP) describing the means of accomplishing the project tasks. The PMP will include milestones to meet the project deliverables and timelines. Milestones will include but are not limited to 1) acceptable cell growth with respect to cell number and viability during scale up, 2) successful bioreactor start up and inoculation, 3) harvesting with sufficient antibody titer and 4) recovery of viable cells to make an End of Production cell bank. <br /><br />B. Risk Management Plan</p>
<p>The PMP will include a risk management plan (RMP) to identify potential technical problems that might arise during the course of work. The Subcontractor shall suggest solutions or alternative back up plans to address these potential problems.</p>
<p>C. Reports and Meetings</p>
<p>1. Project meetings will occur bi-weekly or as required by the Project Scientist<br />2. Monthly technical and financial status reports <br />3. Reports will include assay profiles, technology transfer report, certificates of analysis and a manufacturing report.</p>
<p>D. Production Tasks</p>
<p>A technology transfer package and vials of the MCB will be supplied to the Subcontractor. An Assay Profile of acceptance criteria for the harvest and End of Production bank will be supplied.</p>
<p>1. The cells are scaled up in cell factories or roller bottles until ample cells are obtained to inoculate a hollow fiber bioreactor. The cells have a doubling time of between 50 and 66 hours using CHO-S-SFM II serum free medium (contains glutamine, Invitrogen catalog number 31033), 10% dialyzed Fetal Bovine Serum and 1&micro;M methotrexate. The peak cell density range at 3 days is 8 X104 to 1 X105 per cm2 and the viability remains in the mid 90% range.</p>
<p>2. The bioreactor is run for 60 calendar days. Approximately ten 850cm2 roller bottles are required to inoculate a single 2.1m2 hollow fiber cartridge at 1X109 cells. A bioreactor feasibility run performed at SAIC-F located at the NCI-Frederick at this scale produced 11 grams of unprocessed crude antibody in 10 liters. The bioreactor ran for 53 days.</p>
<p>The medium for the bioreactor is:<br /><br />Intracapillary Side - Modified DMEM/F12 without phenol red, HEPES, Glutamine, 4.5grams glucose/liter <br />L-Glutamine, 4mM final <br />Methotrexate, 1&micro;M final</p>
<p>Extracapillary Side - CHO-S-SFM II (Invitrogen catalog number 31033)<br />10% dialyzed Fetal Bovine Serum Day 0 to day 23 <br />5% dialyzed Fetal Bovine Serum Day 24 to day 60</p>
<p>3. Harvest is collected at +20C to +80C in volumes up to 2 liters or no longer then every 4 days and frozen in aliquots at &le; -70C.</p>
<p>4. A 60 vial End of Production Cell Bank will be required from the longest run (if more then one bioreactor run is needed). Each vial will contain at least 4 X 106 cells</p>
<p>4. Deliverables and Acceptance Criteria</p>
<p>a) 140 &plusmn; 10 grams of bulk sterile harvest frozen at &le; -70C<br />b) 60 vial EOP bank<br />c) Batch Production Records for all bioreactor runs and the EOP bank<br />d) Monthly technical and financial status reports and a comprehensive final report due within 60 days of completion of the project.</p>
<p>Final inspection and acceptance of all work performed, reports and other deliverables will be approved by the SAIC-F Contracting Officer's Technical Representative.<br />All deliverables are also subject to the final review of documentation and release by the SAIC-F Quality Assurance department.</p>
<p>5. Period of Performance</p>
<p>The period of performance is 10 months beginning upon the award of the Subcontract.</p>
<p>6. Other Requirements</p>
<p>1. Facility audit for Subcontractor's technical capability and cGMP compliance</p>
<p>2. Execution of a Quality Agreement prior to or at subcontract award.</p>

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure microarray testing services form Miltenyi Biotec. This is to examine the differences in the manner in which CD8 T cells of progressors and LTNP respond to HIV infected autologous CD4 T cells. This approach allows the interrogation of expression of genes in low number of cells. The need to stimulate cells and sort them requires that arrays to be performed on cell numbers in the 1000-5000 range. This is important for the development of high throughput assays for HIV vaccine trials. The testing results will assist in regarding what aspects of cell cycle are disrupted and how cells may be re-stimulated.

<p>1352.201-71 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE (COTR) (FEB 2005)<br /><br />a. Jamie LaCompte is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). The COTR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the Contractor by a unilateral modification to the Contract. The COTR is located at: 1050 Register Street, Charleston, NC 98102.<br />b. The responsibilities and limitations of the COTR are as follows:<br />(1) The COTR is responsible for the technical aspects of the project and serves as technical liaison with the Contractor. The COTR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all reports, and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract.<br />(2) The COTR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the Contract price, terms or conditions. Any Contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COTR. No such changes shall be made without the expressed prior authorization of the Contracting Officer (CO). The CO may designate assistant or alternate COTR(s) to act for the COTR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the Contractor. <br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>NOAA/ERAD METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR<br />SHIP REPAIR (AUGUST 2005)</p>
<p>The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage or stage of completion. The contractor may invoice each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule, as follows:</p>
<p>A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar work items.)</p>
<p>Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR clause, 52.232-25 will be returned. Invoices shall include (see the clause for a full summation of invoice requirements):</p>
<p>Name and Address of the contractor;<br />Invoice date<br />Contract Number/Modification No.<br />CLIN/Work Item No., Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price;<br />Shipping and Payment Terms;<br />Name and Address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent;<br />Name, title, phone number, and mailing address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice.</p>
<p>The invoice must include:</p>
<p>a) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />b) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />c) Ship name; and,<br />d) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.</p>
<p>Note: When invoicing for growth work, the contractor shall identify it as Growth and shall identify the modification number to which authorization was given and the CLIN/work item that the growth is associated.</p>
<p>The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is the primary identifier in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), (see FAR 52.232-33). Contractors are located and identified in CCR by their DUNS number. Therefore, to facilitate payment, it is in the contractor's best interest to ensure that the DUNS number is recorded on every invoice submitted against this contract.</p>
<p>All payments based on percentage or stage of completion rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the prime contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend percentage or stage of completion payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subcontract agreement.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office.</p>
<p>Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration provided all supporting documentation is submitted and validated.</p>
<p>Additional work verbally agreed to by the parties that has not yet been incorporated into the contract by modification shall not be included in an invoice. Payments will not be made for any work to which a modification has not been properly executed. Invoices submitted for payment that includes such a request will be reduced by the unmodified amount.</p>
<p>Invoices shall be mailed to the designated billing office, as follows:</p>
<p>Department of Commerce/NOAA<br />Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD)<br />Attn: Robin Resweber<br />200 Granby Street, 8th Floor<br />Norfolk, VA 23510<br />Robin.Resweber@noaa.gov</p>
<p>The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER EA133M-09-SU-XXXX (to be assigned upon contract award). &#61618;</p>
<p>NOAA/ERAD ADDITIONAL ITEM REQUESTS LABOR RATE (MARCH 2005)<br /><br />The Additional Item Requests (AIRs) labor rate (CLIN 0006) offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>a. The rate for all man-hours of labor, to be used for emergent work if ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the "Changes - Ship Repair" or mutually agreed upon by the parties by supplemental agreement to accomplish additional work not required elsewhere in the work items, shall be established using this labor rate. The estimated man-hours for this Dockside Availability are listed in Section B. <br /><br />b. This rate shall be a flat rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include:</p>
<p>1 . Production man-hours shall be for skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in <br />direct production as exemplified by the following functions: Abrasive Cleaning/Blasting, Blacksmithing, Boilermaking, Carpentry, Crane Operation, Electrical/Electronics Work, Engineering (Production), Insulating/Lagging, Machining (inside and outside), Painting, Pipe Fitting, Rigging, Sheet-metal Work, Shipfitting, Shipwrights, Staging/Scaffolding, Tank Cleaning, and Welding/Burning/Brazing.<br /><br />2 . Non-production man-hours (whether charged as direct labor or indirect labor by the contractors accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production man-hours. Examples of support functions include: Engineering (support), Estimating, General Labor, Firewatch, Material Handling, Planning, Quality Assurance, Security (General), Supervision, Surveying, Testing, and Transportation.</p>
<p>3 . Other indirect charges including but not limited to the following: overhead, general and administrative, support functions, facilities, and capital cost of money and profit for the contractor and any subcontractors selected by the prime contractor. The hourly rate will not be used to price work which may be directed to a subcontractor by name in the work specifications.</p>
<p>c. All material costs shall be paid based on the contractor's return cost plus the markup identified in Section B (CLIN 0006). The estimated worth of additional material for this item is also listed in Section B.</p>
<p>d. The contractor shall take into account full award of estimated AIRs hours during the development of the Production Schedule. Award of any portion of this item does not in its self justify an extension to the original contract completion date.<br /><br />e. The quantities of AIRs labor hours (CLIN 0006) and additional material (CLIN 0007) indicated in Section B are only estimates and are Growth Items pursuant to this solicitation. The provided burdened man-hour rates and material cost rate shall remain in effect for the entire life of the contract. The estimated quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours/material that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule at its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusions of these items do not obligate the Government to exercise the item(s) nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items <em>Alternate II</em> (MAY 2009) applies and the following additional FAR clauses cited in the clause at paragraph (b) are applicable to this acquisition, as such consider the following clauses checked, (3), (4), (8), (18), (19), (20), (21), (22) (31), (34) and (39).</p>

USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM - STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (NOV 2004) (NAVSUP) 
(1)   The offeror's past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System - Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier's performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier's past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier's overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
	1.  Dark Blue:	Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group*	2.  Purple:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*	3.  Green:	Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group*	4.  Yellow:	Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group*	5.  Red:		Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier's percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating.

Request for drawings must be made by close of business November 10th, 2009 through  Michael R. Jackson who can be reached at email: Michael.r.jackson3@navy.mil

<p>Any questions may be submitted via e-mail to the above individual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A site visit was held on 14 Sept 2009. The following is a list of the companies that attended:</p>
<p>1. High Tech Services - Richardson, TX<br />2. Reimers Systems-Lorton, VA<br />3. SAIC-Midwest City, OK<br />4. Virtual Technology Services-Midwest City, OK</p>
<p><br /><strong>Q &amp; A</strong></p>
<p>1. Can any of the existing electrical disconnect boxes be relocated or deleted?</p>
<p>ANS. The disconnect labeled "Breaker Box for The Circulation Pump" has power running to it however it is no longer connected to a load so it can be removed along with the feed running to it.</p>
<p>ANS. The disconnect labeled for the Vibration System is located just north of the Circulation Pump Disconnect. This disconnect is in use but it will be moved approximately 6 ft north along the west wall and reinstalled there.</p>
<p>ANS. The disconnect which powered the chiller and is now the source of power for the blower/sucker fan will require reinstallation to the north approximately 8 feet.</p>
<p>2. If the large air duct can be relocated?</p>
<p>ANS. The large air duct can be relocated to the north and reconnected to the blower/sucker fan in its present location provided C.E. grants permission for the additional penetration of the wall and the old vacant hole is properly sealed to their standards.</p>
<p>3. Can the chilled water lines be relocated to the south wall?</p>
<p>ANS. In room 119 the chill water lines can be located to the south wall if they are then run north into the trench as they provide cooling for the shaker and the environmental chamber via their path through the trench.</p>
<p>4. Will there be a requirement for any pass-thru conduit to the outside?</p>
<p>ANS. I see the possible necessity for two conduits. One would be for transducer wiring from the accumulator tank, air duct, and vacuum pumps to the control system located in room 119. The other would be for a compressed air line if the design calls for pneumatic actuators to be used on the system.</p>
<p>5. Can we either come out and take some photo's or if Mr. Fleenor has already taken some can he send them to us?</p>
<p>ANS.I have provided the photos which I took and annotated to Michelle Syth. She will make copies available in accordance with their procedures. If she or her supervisors have no objections I am agreeable to someone coming to take additional photos, measurements, or asking questions whenever I am present.<br />**The photos are posted as an attachment to this notice**</p>
<p>6. How accurate does the pressure profile have to be?<br />ANS. +/- 5/3% (1.6) percent of the value or +/- 200/3 Pa, whichever is greater. Per Mil-Std-810F Part One 5.2 Tolerances for test conditions and Part One 5.3.2 Calibration</p>
<p>7. Does the profile have to be linear or parabolic?</p>
<p>ANS. For the purpose of our testing a linear time history showing the change in engineering units (EUs) of pressure per unit of time in milliseconds is all that is needed.</p>
<p>8. What software is preferred for data acquisition system of EDTF?</p>
<p>ANS. No preference, Labview is ok as it is being used in some of the other systems in the lab, but it is not a requirement.</p>
<p>9. Can the bid documents be submitted by email by 5th of October? If paper documents are requested, how many copies are required?</p>
<p>ANS. As of 24 Sep 2009, the documents are due by 5 Oct 2009 (see solicitation for exact response time). One completed copy of both the original solicitation and any amendments are required to be submitted. E-mailed documents are preferred, however they may also be submitted via facsimile.</p>
<p>10. Will the vacuum pump on the EDTF be used for other purposes in addition to the EDTF or is it dedicated only to the EDTF?</p>
<p>ANS. The vacuum pump on the EDTF is for one purpose only, the EDTF.<br /><br />11. Are there any quality standards in addition to those listed in the SOW?</p>
<p>ANS. The accuracy and performance of the test system controls and data acquisition must meet or exceed the associated requirements of MIL-STD-810F. Construction and fabrication of the facility shall be in compliance with prevailing Tinker AFB, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma County, and State of Oklahoma applicable laws and regulations as well as national rules, regulations, laws, and codes as they may apply. As an example would be National Electrical code.</p>
<p><br />12. Will user training be required?</p>
<p>ANS. Training Requirements will be limited by the delivery of Operation Manuals covering maintenance of the Vacuum Pump, Actuators, and Other Moving Components as well as an Operation Manual detailing the functions of the Graphical Interface Icons of the Control Software used to manage test parameters and Data Acquisition.</p>
<p>The EDTF Control Software shall enable Data Acquisition parameter selection such as Sampling Rates up to 50k Samples per Second.</p>
<p>Accumulator Pressure shall be expressed in kPa, psia, torrs, or Inches of Mercury.<br />Chamber Pressure/Altitude and Change of Rate, both positive and negative, shall both be expressed in selectable units of Meters (Altitude) - psia - kPa per Second or Minute for Change of Rate. Pressure is to be expressed in Meters (Altitude)-psia &amp; kPa.</p>
<p>The units listed above are in accordance with MIL-STD-810F.</p>
<p>13. Would it be acceptible for us to propose the following? A system that is in every way and to the best of our ability designed to meet the required decompression profile but in the end may only depressurize at (for example) 0.4 seconds.</p>
<p>ANS. MIL-STD-810 F REQUIRES 0.1 SECONDS FOR EXPLOSIVE DECOMPRESSION TESTS (EDT)</p>
<p>14. Does your group know of any facility that can meet the desired decompression rate that we could see or otherwise learn from?</p>
<p>ANS. Such a test was conducted in 2008 at Brooks AFB, TX; A graph is attached to this notice (Brooks AFB Graph.pdf)</p>
<p><br />15. Will the contractor be required to have the soil analyzed for contaminates?</p>
<p>ANS. NO</p>
<p>16. If the soil is not contaminated can it be disposed of at any local landfill or dirt/rock only dump location?</p>
<p>ANS. YES<br /><br />17. If the soil is contaminated, Will the contractor be responsible for disposing of the soil at the East Oak Landfill?</p>
<p>ANS. YES and require coordination through 72ABW/CEPR or CER (this office would be the generator and would sign manifests before disposal)</p>
<p>18. Can the concrete and asphalt be disposed of at any local landfill or dirt/rock only dump location?</p>
<p>ANS. YES Rock disposal can be anywhere, common location is Campbell's recycling on nearby 59th St as it's free and we usually specify recycling</p>
<p>19. Does the pressure vessel (Vacuum Accumulator) have to be ASME stamped or meet some other pressure vessel design standard?</p>
<p>ANS. See attached statement of work revised on 6 Nov 2009</p>
<p><br />20. The facility shall include a test chamber with minimum working interior dimensions of 48" wide, 48" high and 36" deep. Maximum interior dimensions shall not exceed 60" wide, 60" high and 48" deep. Maximum exterior dimensions shall not exceed 62" wide, 62" high and 50" deep. My question is concerning the outer dimensions of the vessel. A cylindrical vessel would be cheaper to manufacture however, to meet the specific of the interior dimensions, the vessel would need to have a outer diameter of approximately 29" including wall thickness. Is cost more import or is it paramount to meet the dimensions given in section 1.4.3?</p>
<p>ANS. See attached statement of work revised on 6 Nov 2009</p>
<p><br />21. Alternative materials to stainless steel?</p>
<p>ANS. See attached statement of work revised on 6 Nov 2009</p>

<DESC>2nd Set of Questions:<br />I would like to submit a quote on your waste disposal. We inventory, pack, label and ship waste but our disposal pricing is based on container, not weight. Is it possible to submit a price sheet by size of container instead of weight. Freight and labor is fixed. Do you have any explosive materials that would require special handling? Most government quotes require specific information according to Form SF33, will this quote require anything of that nature?
<p>Answers are:<br />Container size varies from 5 lb for small containers to 30gal barrels for lab packs.<br />Yes, we ship small amounts (1-1000grams) of explosives.<br />We also ship 'Universal Waste' (fluorescent bulbs and waste oil, paint, etc). We provide our own boxes for the fluorescent bulbs.<br />SF33 is not required.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
 


Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the "bullpen", serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed. As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&amp;id=59&amp;fam=0 .</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Intermittent, Washington, DC - based</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the "bullpen", serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Program Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed. As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Program Advisor position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations oversight and management in the field to provide ad hoc support for assessments, new country start-ups, and program implementation support, as well as training and mentoring of staff both in the field and in Washington. The Personal Services Contractor (PSC) employee will also be involved in strategic design of various OTI country programs and the development of management products for OTI based on lessons learned. The incumbent is considered an expert in the field of political transition programming overseas.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Chief, Field Programs Division (FPD), the Senior Transition Advisor will:</p>

<p>&bull; Conduct, in collaboration with the relevant OTI regional team, assessments for possible new country programs, and visits to field sites in areas where OTI has projects;</p>
<p>&bull; Act as OTI's in-country Start-Up Manager for limited periods of time for new country start-ups, or provide support while an OTI Country Representative is on leave, or when OTI has not determined the length of a new country program, but is required to have a presence on the ground;</p>
<p>&bull; Execute, if required, closeout activities related to OTI programs, and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;</p>
<p>&bull; Negotiate, within the guidelines provided by the OTI Chief, FPD, or his/her designee, program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts;</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Conceptualize and design country program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy. When necessary, assist in refining strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in-country, possibly linked to neighboring country programs if considered appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the development of information management products and improved business practices for OTI based on research and personal field experience lessons learned;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff both in Washington and the field as required;</p>
<p>&bull; Represent and articulate OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials.</p>
<p>&bull; Identify or seek out NGOs, international donors, USG agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;</p>
<p>&bull; Advise and/or assist in drafting documents outlining future planning and vision in the development and implementation of OTI programs, and assist in developing and improving country program monitoring and evaluation systems, providing guidance on designing and managing final evaluations;</p>
<p>&bull; Advise Senior Management and Team Leaders on budget processes and reviews, preparing justification documentation when necessary;</p>
<p>&bull; Update and revise, as needed, program management guides, including strategic planning and field operations materials;</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as a liaison with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions and the State Department on program and policy direction;</p>
<p>&bull; Help ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners.</p>
<p><br />SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Advisor will be supervised by the OTI Chief, Field Programs Division, and will also work under the general guidance and direction of the OTI Country Representative when in the field.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:</p>
<p>The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.

The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&amp;id=59&amp;fam=0 .</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Intermittent, Washington, DC - based</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&amp;id=59&amp;fam=0 .</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Intermittent, Worldwide</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts referred in OTI as the "bullpen", serving on intermittent contracts to provide surge capacity for OTI in Washington and the field. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Transition Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed. As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&amp;id=59&amp;fam=0 .</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>This purpose of this modification is to add an additional topic area as follows. <br /><br />Mixed-Initiative Course of Action (COA) Critics/Advisors: A plan critiquing and advising capability is needed to augment an existing analogical reasoning system for distributed, mixed initiative operational-level planning. Known as the Distributed Episodic Exploratory Planning (DEEP) architecture, this architecture harnesses experience to rapidly recognize and characterize a situation, plan quickly recalling prior successes and/or failures, and then explore what that plan may accomplish. This research prototype system utilizes an extended plan representation schema based on the ARPI Core Plan Representation, a blackboard-based architecture to support multi-agent non-deterministic opportunistic reasoning, case-based reasoning (CBR) to capture experiences (successes and/or failures), critic engines for mixed initiative plan refinement, and constructive simulation for exploration of plausible future states. The DEEP project is further detailed in AFRL Interim Technical Report AFRL-RI-RS-TR-2008-279, "Distributed Episodic Exploratory Planning", by Carozzoni, J., Lawton, J., DeStefano, C., Ford, A., Hudack, J., Lachevet, K. &amp; Staskevich, G. (2008).
<p>This plan critiquing and advising capability component will be used to refine rough, higher-order plans, based on the output of a multiple case-based plan retrieval process, into more detailed, cohesive plans by analyzing such aspects as quality, critical dependencies, possible omissions, undesirable effects, resource constraints, etc. Review and assessment of specific aspects of the plan at lower levels of detail is desired over a single assessment of the plan as a whole. Coherent plans and context need to be mapped to a set of critic engines which, in turn, provide their domain expertise back as validation and/or improvements to the plan, making the plan complete and consistent at these lower levels.</p>
<p>Issues to be addressed under this amendment include, but are not limited to: activation of specific critics, de-confliction of critic output, collaboration between critics, plan modification by critics; trust, pedigree and, authority of critics to act; assembly and integration of critics, control and oversight of activated critics, and the necessary run-time support environment, including interfacing and integration of the critics to both the underlying DEEP architecture and human operators. The research is envisioned as having three components: (a) Development of individual critics - addressing scenario interaction, scope of application, initial assessment and categories of expertise; (b) Multi-critic framework - addressing critic interaction and communication, critic control and collaboration, and negotiation and division of labor between human and machine critics; and (c) Enhanced performance - addressing metric identification, explanation and information assurance issues. Execution of the critics should be independent of the larger case-based reasoning framework, allowing dynamic assembly of a critic community, distributed implementations and sourcing of plans and plan fragments from multiple case-bases.</p>
<p>The recommended date for white papers for this topic is by 4 December 2009. DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer. For this topic area, all white papers must be addressed to ATTN: Dale Richards, Reference BAA-05-06-IFKA, AFRL/RISC, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505. Respondents are required to provide their Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number with their submittal and reference BAA-05-06-IFKA. Electronic submissions to: dale.richards@rl.af.mil will also be accepted.<br /><br />No other changes have been made.</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about November 30, 2009 for an anticipated five-year Cost plus Fixed-Fee contract, for Mission-wide Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) services. The primary objective of the contract is the development of an M&amp;E activity to provide continued performance monitoring, verification and evaluation of the impact, output results and environmental compliance of the various USAID programs and activities as well as other programs and activities as required by USAID.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The goal of the M&amp;E Activity will be to enable USAID/Colombia to meet management information needs in order to make informed management decisions, as well as to shape the longer-term strategic direction and decision-making. This M&amp;E activity will not replace the M&amp;E systems that other USAID partners use in their programs. Rather, it is intended to standardize, collect and disseminate the results (indicators) as a means to centralize and assess progress towards achieving USAID's Assistance Objectives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The M&amp;E program will provide activity-level monitoring and evaluation services designed to provide qualitative and/or quantitative analyses and reviews of specific Mission activities and programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of these M&amp;E services could include, but are not limited to: field verification exercises of the indicator results provided by USAID implementing partners, targeted activity-level 'impact audits' (showing the changes in the quality of live and/or standard of living of beneficiaries due to USAID program inputs), verification of activities' environmental compliance, generation of success stories, and/or rapid economic assessments of regions and localities. The USAID Clearinghouse is another component of this program and will serve as the USAID/Colombia country-wide reporting platform to all implementing partners. In addition, the USAID M&amp;E Program will be available to give guidance in the preparation of indicators, Performance Management Plans (PMPs) and other performance management tools for other USAID implementers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regarding the Colombia Strategic Development Initiative (CSDI) -the U.S. Embassy's strategy developed in order to complement the Government of Colombia's National Consolidation Plan- the M&amp;E Program will be tasked to develop a USAID CSDI PMP, including common quantitative and qualitative measures to be collected at the CSDI regions, and to conduct an evaluation of the CSDI impact results at the level of the beneficiaries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to these requirements and the need of this M&amp;E Program to conduct field surveys of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>beneficiaries, communities and local organizations, as well as random field verifications of the activities conducted by other USAID implementers, a close collaboration will be required between the implementers' M&amp;E systems and the overall USAID M&amp;E Program.</p>

<DESC><p>RECOVERY: The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design and Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project.</p>
<p>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design and Construction Excellence Programs seeks to commission our nation's most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give form and meaning to our democratic values.</p>
<p>In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA's P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). All GSA projects must achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating with specific credits required.</p>
<p><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to construct a new Tier III Data Center at the Denver Federal Center in Lakewood, Colorado. The Data Center will be located in the Northeast corner of the DFC campus on the corner of {East} First Street and North Center Avenue. The Tier III Data Center is based on the Uptime Institute Tier Level Classification System which will contain redundancy for failure and maintenance and shall be built utilizing the Performance Optimized Datacenter (POD) concept.</p>
<p>The building will include 2 stories with a mechanical basement, for 110,000 gross square feet (GSF). The new Data Center will be located in a prominent position on the DFC at the corner of first Street and North Center Avenue, Lakewood, Colorado. The project will be built in phases. Phase 1 is the current building project, including core, shell and infrastructure to support the first POD Phase. When complete the project will contain its own perimeter security system and parking for 20 vehicles.</p>
<p>The project will include the performance of architectural, engineering, construction, security, commissioning and other related services necessary to construct the new Data Center. Related services include but are not limited to, site planning and infrastructure, geotechnical evaluation and monitoring, permitting, testing and inspection during construction, commissioning and potential additional requirements. The project will be based on 20% Bridging Documents and Program of Requirements, which will be provided with the Request for Proposal during Phase II of the acquisition process for this procurement pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The project shall be performed in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements for a new Tier III Data Center (Data Center) at the Denver Federal Center (DFC), Lakewood, Colorado. The Data Center is classified as a Tier III facility as defined by the Uptime Institute Tier Level Classification System. The work will be performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The Data Center will be two stories high with a mechanical basement and will be built in phases using the Performance Optimized Datacenter (POD) concept. Phase 1 is the current building project, including core and shell and infrastructure to support the first POD Phase. When complete, the project will contain its own perimeter security system and parking for 2 cars on-site and 20 existing off-site, adjacent to the site. The completed two-story building with mechanical basement will encompass approximately 110,000 Gross Square Feet. As required by law, the facility will meet federal energy goals and all federal accessibility requirements and standards. The project goal will meet LEED-Silver rating requirements. The GSA is the lead agency for the delivery of this facility</p>
<p>The scope of professional services will require the minimum services as follows: architectural, engineering, construction, security, commissioning. This list is not all-inclusive.</p>
<p>GSA will contract separately for Construction Management as Agent (CMa) services. The CMa will be involved in the design process to provide construction expertise, estimating and cost information, and functionality and constructability reviews. There will be a formal partnering process throughout the design and construction phases to promote successful project development and execution through voluntary commitments to accomplish established agreed-upon project objectives by all involved parties.</p>
<p>The estimated cost for the design-build delivery of the new Data Center is between $65,000,000 and $80,000,000.</p>
<p>Opportunities for other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses to the maximum extent practicable. In this procurement, GSA intends to promote contractors' and subcontractors' use of registered Apprenticeship Programs.</p>
<p>NOTICE TO OFFERORS<br />GSA intends to award a firm-fixed price Design-Build Contract based upon 20% bridging documents and Program of Requirements which will be provided with the Request for Proposal during Phase II of the acquisition process for this procurement pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. A maximum of up to five (5) firms will be short listed unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than five (5) is in the Government's best interest. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).<br /><br />A best value concept will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement. The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked. GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being weighed more heavily than price. Therefore, the Offeror's proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms.</p>
<p>This procurement will be conducted as a Two-Phase Deisgn-build process. Phase One will evaluate the technical qualifications and experience of the design and construction teams formed by each potential offeror for this procurement. Phase Two will interview the key Design-Build team members, evaluate the proposed technical solution and Project Management Plan of each design and construction team.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions or negotiations.</p>
<p>GSA IS HEREBY REQUESTING PHASE ONE PROPOSALS. This Phase One Solicitation provides Offerors with instructions regarding the submission of their complete Proposals and the evaluation thereof.

<p>The building will include 2 stories with a mechanical basement, for 110,000 gross square feet (GSF). The new Data Center will be located in a prominent position on the DFC at the corner of first Street and North Center Avenue, Lakewood, Colorado. The project will be built in phases. Phase 1 is the current building project, including core, shell and infrastructure to support the first POD Phase. When complete the project will contain its own perimeter security system and parking for 20 vehicles.</p>
<p>The project will include the performance of architectural, engineering, construction, security, commissioning and other related services necessary to construct the new Data Center. Related services include but are not limited to, site planning and infrastructure, geotechnical evaluation and monitoring, permitting, testing and inspection during construction, commissioning and potential additional requirements. The project will be based on 20% Bridging Documents and Program of Requirements, which will be provided with the Request for Proposal during Phase II of the acquisition process for this procurement pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The project shall be performed in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements for a new Tier III Data Center (Data Center) at the Denver Federal Center (DFC), Lakewood, Colorado. The Data Center is classified as a Tier III facility as defined by the Uptime Institute Tier Level Classification System. The work will be performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The Data Center will be two stories high with a mechanical basement and will be built in phases using the Performance Optimized Datacenter (POD) concept. Phase 1 is the current building project, including core and shell and infrastructure to support the first POD Phase. When complete, the project will contain its own perimeter security system and parking for 2 cars on-site and 20 existing off-site, adjacent to the site. The completed two-story building with mechanical basement will encompass approximately 110,000 Gross Square Feet. As required by law, the facility will meet federal energy goals and all federal accessibility requirements and standards. The project goal will meet LEED-Silver rating requirements. The GSA is the lead agency for the delivery of this facility</p>
<p>The scope of professional services will require the minimum services as follows: architectural, engineering, construction, security, commissioning. This list is not all-inclusive.</p>
<p>GSA will contract separately for Construction Management as Agent (CMa) services. The CMa will be involved in the design process to provide construction expertise, estimating and cost information, and functionality and constructability reviews. There will be a formal partnering process throughout the design and construction phases to promote successful project development and execution through voluntary commitments to accomplish established agreed-upon project objectives by all involved parties.</p>
<p>The estimated cost for the design-build delivery of the new Data Center is between $65,000,000 and $80,000,000.</p>
<p>Opportunities for other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses to the maximum extent practicable. In this procurement, GSA intends to promote contractors' and subcontractors' use of registered Apprenticeship Programs.</p>
<p>NOTICE TO OFFERORS<br />GSA intends to award a firm-fixed price Design-Build Contract based upon 20% bridging documents and Program of Requirements which will be provided with the Request for Proposal during Phase II of the acquisition process for this procurement pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. A maximum of up to five (5) firms will be short listed unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than five (5) is in the Government's best interest. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).<br /><br />A best value concept will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement. The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked. GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being weighed more heavily than price. Therefore, the Offeror's proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms.</p>
<p>This procurement will be conducted as a Two-Phase Deisgn-build process. Phase One will evaluate the technical qualifications and experience of the design and construction teams formed by each potential offeror for this procurement. Phase Two will interview the key Design-Build team members, evaluate the proposed technical solution and Project Management Plan of each design and construction team.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions or negotiations.</p>

<DESC><p>RECOVERY: The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design and Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project.</p>
<p>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design and Construction Excellence Programs seeks to commission our nation's most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give form and meaning to our democratic values.</p>
<p>In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA's P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). All GSA projects must achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating with specific credits required.</p>
<p><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to construct a new Tier III Data Center at the Denver Federal Center in Lakewood, Colorado. The Data Center will be located in the Northeast corner of the DFC campus on the corner of {East} First Street and North Center Avenue. The Tier III Data Center is based on the Uptime Institute Tier Level Classification System which will contain redundancy for failure and maintenance and shall be built utilizing the Performance Optimized Datacenter (POD) concept.</p>
<p>The building will include 2 stories with a mechanical basement, for 110,000 gross square feet (GSF). The new Data Center will be located in a prominent position on the DFC at the corner of first Street and North Center Avenue, Lakewood, Colorado. The project will be built in phases. Phase 1 is the current building project, including core, shell and infrastructure to support the first POD Phase. When complete the project will contain its own perimeter security system and parking for 20 vehicles.</p>
<p>The project will include the performance of architectural, engineering, construction, security, commissioning and other related services necessary to construct the new Data Center. Related services include but are not limited to, site planning and infrastructure, geotechnical evaluation and monitoring, permitting, testing and inspection during construction, commissioning and potential additional requirements. The project will be based on 20% Bridging Documents and Program of Requirements, which will be provided with the Request for Proposal during Phase II of the acquisition process for this procurement pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The project shall be performed in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements for a new Tier III Data Center (Data Center) at the Denver Federal Center (DFC), Lakewood, Colorado. The Data Center is classified as a Tier III facility as defined by the Uptime Institute Tier Level Classification System. The work will be performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The Data Center will be two stories high with a mechanical basement and will be built in phases using the Performance Optimized Datacenter (POD) concept. Phase 1 is the current building project, including core and shell and infrastructure to support the first POD Phase. When complete, the project will contain its own perimeter security system and parking for 2 cars on-site and 20 existing off-site, adjacent to the site. The completed two-story building with mechanical basement will encompass approximately 110,000 Gross Square Feet. As required by law, the facility will meet federal energy goals and all federal accessibility requirements and standards. The project goal will meet LEED-Silver rating requirements. The GSA is the lead agency for the delivery of this facility</p>
<p>The scope of professional services will require the minimum services as follows: architectural, engineering, construction, security, commissioning. This list is not all-inclusive.</p>
<p>GSA will contract separately for Construction Management as Agent (CMa) services. The CMa will be involved in the design process to provide construction expertise, estimating and cost information, and functionality and constructability reviews. There will be a formal partnering process throughout the design and construction phases to promote successful project development and execution through voluntary commitments to accomplish established agreed-upon project objectives by all involved parties.</p>
<p>The estimated cost for the design-build delivery of the new Data Center is between $65,000,000 and $80,000,000.</p>
<p>Opportunities for other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses to the maximum extent practicable. In this procurement, GSA intends to promote contractors' and subcontractors' use of registered Apprenticeship Programs.</p>
<p>NOTICE TO OFFERORS<br />GSA intends to award a firm-fixed price Design-Build Contract based upon 20% bridging documents and Program of Requirements which will be provided with the Request for Proposal during Phase II of the acquisition process for this procurement pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. A maximum of up to five (5) firms will be short listed unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than five (5) is in the Government's best interest. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).<br /><br />A best value concept will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement. The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked. GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being weighed more heavily than price. Therefore, the Offeror's proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms.</p>
<p>This procurement will be conducted as a Two-Phase Deisgn-build process. Phase One will evaluate the technical qualifications and experience of the design and construction teams formed by each potential offeror for this procurement. Phase Two will interview the key Design-Build team members, evaluate the proposed technical solution and Project Management Plan of each design and construction team.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions or negotiations.</p>

<p><br />F. SUMMARY OF THE PHASE TWO SOLICITATION PROCESS</p>
<p>The following information is provided in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 36.303-1(a)(3). DO NOT SUBMIT A RESPONSE TO PHASE TWO EVALUATION FACTORS AT THIS TIME. Only firms selected during the Phase One evaluation process will be requested to submit a response to Phase Two.<br />The most highly qualified Offerors selected in Phase One will be provided the opportunity to submit competitive technical and price Proposals as detailed in the Phase Two Solicitation. Phase Two will require an acknowledgment by each Offeror that the selected Offeror will comply with all the mandatory performance criteria, technical specifications, and space program requirements within a pre-established maximum cost for the complete Project. Phase Two shall be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15 (Contracting by Negotiation); one Contract will be awarded using competitive negotiation.</p>
<p>The Evaluation Factors to be used in Phase Two are listed below in descending order of importance. While price is an important consideration, all non-price evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price. However, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit (as determined by the evaluation of the non-price evaluation factors set forth below), the evaluated price becomes more important and may become the determining factor for award. The non-price evaluation factors are set out below in descending order of importance.</p>
<p>Phase Two Evaluation Factors:</p>
<p>&bull; Proposed Technical Solutions <br />&bull; Project Management Plan</p>
<p>All submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number GS-08P-09-JA-C-0089. Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(c)(3). Facsimile proposals will not be accepted. Be advised that, due to heightened security measures, individuals entering a Federal facility must have photo identification and may be delayed. Firms planning to hand-deliver submissions should take this into consideration.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): OCCI INC, W912DQ-09-C-1035<br><br>This Modification will be issued pursuant to American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  This will be a firm fixed price modification to an existing contract.  The Government intends to issue a sole source procurement to the existing contractor for the following additional work: additional weld repair and re-painting services to Intake Gates 1, 2 and 3 to ensure the complete structural repairs of the intake gates prior to award and completion of the In-Place Turbine Blade Repair contract.  Due to the location of the additional weld repair work to be completed on the Intake Gates of the Hydraulic Steel Structure within the Stockton Dam Power Plant, there is no way to get another contractor into the area while the current Contractor completes the work without severely impacting safety and the schedule.  Safety concerns are related to having several contractors in a confined space, wearing hose-supplied air breathing apparatus that may get tangled with other equipment. The schedule concerns are related to the sequential implementation of the weld repairs prior to painting within each gate.  The current contract calls for painting of the Hydraulic Steel Structure, this modification would require removal of additional paint, welding work on the Intake Gate and additional painting.<BR><BR>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<BR><BR>If interested provide a proposal on company letter head with a complete detailed description how work will be accomplished in order to maintain safety, and prevent impact to schedule, and necessary skills and qualifications.  Documentation should be limited to 10 pages.  <BR>

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 03 is to answer Industry Questions.
Question:
1. Understand, my question is about section III.  The statement: "The duration of effect shall be sufficient to prevent the emergence of combative individuals from mouse holes"....this implies some type of gas, or concussion sufficient to provide this affect.  If so thisappears to rule out a single technology approach of visual disruption. Would this be a correct assumption?  
Answer:
No, it would not rule out a single technology approach.  If the proposed visual disruption technology has a sufficient duration of effect, and does not limit friendly forces from simultaneously accomplishing their clear a space mission, then it would be an appropriate technology consideration.
Question:
2.  Would techniques to improve the delivery of NLWs be considered or is this BAA (10-001) solely for RD&D of the NLWs themselves?  Specifically we have an improved means of utilizing NLWs on a UGV in tight quarters.  We do not know if this is within the scope of the BAA or not. 
Answer:  
Techniques to improve the delivery of NLWs would be considered as within the scope of the BAA.

<DESC>Earth covered storage magazines (igloos) have a two step differential between the pavement and igloo floor.  This 1942 design was intended for small packaged hand carried munitions which required no additional material handling equipment.  However, todays larger munitions require a forklift to move munitions in and out of the storage igloos through a four foot wide door.  A step differential from the apron to the door of the igloo requires ammunitions handlers to set up temporary metal ramps to allow forklifts to enter igloos.  Todays larger missile containers require two munitions handlers to straddle these large containers end to end through the four foot side doors in order to store and retrieve them.  The continued practice of manually setting temporary ramps creates inefficient operations, and if not corrected may result in safety hazards during icy conditions.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESCTP), project number ER-0933, is funded by the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009.  The full amount of the contract falls within the topic area of anaerobic digester.  The objective of this contract is to demonstrate and provide the DoD with a renewable energy source to meet the daily needs of DoD installations while limiting environmental impact, reducing demand on stressed energy systems, reducing overall operations and maintenance costs and increasing the reliability of the site specific power systems.  This is to be completed in accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT) and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2007 (NDAA).    <BR><BR>RATIONALE FOR CONTRACT AWARD THAT IS NOT FIXED PRICE:  This is a R&D type contract in support of the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) issued against BAA-08-0003.  Cost Reimbursement contracts are suitable for use when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit cost to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.  The nature of development work often requires a cost-reimbursement arrangement.  In addition, the contractor's accounting system has been deemed adequate for determining cost applicable to the contract and appropriate Government surveillance during performance will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and cost controls are used.

Nature of Acquisition Being Approved:  Sole source contractor shall provide an Immage 800 Analyzer and all related consumables to accomplish a cost-per-test contract for the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System.3. Description of Requirement: VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System is requesting sole source service contract from Beckman Coulter, 250 S. Kramer Blvd., P.O. Box 550, Brea, CA 92621 to provide a cost-per-test contract for the Immage 800 Analyzer.

The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: VAGLAHS requires the Beckman Coulter IMMAGE 800 Special Chemistry Instrument to provide the laboratory an instrument to run Immunology tests. There are three characteristics that differentiate the IMMAGE 800 from other Special Chemistry Analyzers; it is the Only True Rate Nephelometer, Performs Dynamic Blanking, and can handle Antigen Excess Checking. Finally, the Beckman Coulter IMMAGE 800 has been technically successful and the basis for established procedures in the Immunology lab since its introduction.The Immunology laboratory at VAGLAHS processes approximately 12,678 specimens per year that require application of the process of various types of Immunology tests. The specific laboratory purpose of the IMMAGE 800 is to provide for the automated and thus repeatable high quality testing. This volume of tests can only be produced via the IMMAGE 800 as staffing to manually produce this number of tests is prohibited and not cost effective. Path & Lab Service at GLAVA requests granting a sole source contract to Beckman Coulter for procurement of supplies to operate on IMMAGE 800.  This automated Special Chemistry system allows for specific testing of high quality tests while maximizing the amount of technical labor time in the laboratory. Additionally, current establish protocols for the testing as well as the interpretation of the tests are all based on the IMMAGE 800 and the proprietary Beckman Coulter IMMAGE 800 differentiating features. Thus, only the Beckman Coulter IMMAGE 800 Special Chemistry analyzer meets the requirements of Pathology & Laboratory Service at GLAVA6.
