<SUBJECT>P--Maintain Log Booms and Salvage Floating Debris from the Columbia River above FDR Lake
<SOLNBR>06SP101634
<ARCHDATE>09062007
<CONTACT>John Hedeen Contract Specialist 2083785105     jhedeen@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>Later in the Fall of this year, the Bureau of Reclamation will issue a solicitation for a five-year contract for the operation and maintenance of a series of log booms for the collection and disposal of floating debris on Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) Lake.  FDR Lake was formed by the impoundment of the Columbia River behind the Grand Coulee Dam.  The work sites are at the upper end of FDR Lake near the town of Kettle Falls, Washington, which is approximately 80 miles North/Northwest of Spokane, Washington.  Although the solicitation will not be ready until late September or October, the site visit for the work described below will be held on Thursday, September 14, 2006.  The NAICS Code for this action is 488390.  Reclamation has two debris collection sites and one debris removal site on the Columbia River near Kettle Falls, WA.  The two collection sites are located at China Bar (approximately River Mile 724) and at the mouth of the Kettle River (approximately River Mile 707).  The disposal site is at Boise Cove, downstream from the mouth of the Kettle River (approximately River Mile 702).  The collection sites use log booms to capture floating debris.  The floating debris consists of logs, snags, and slash from up-river logging, uprooted trees and brush from riverbank undercutting, miscellaneous debris, and garbage.     Historically, the debris has been constrained with log booms and towed by tug boat to Boise Cove for removal.     Depending on the lake level, a concrete boat ramp at Boise Cove allows a contractor easy access for removing debris.  Once out of the water the debris becomes the property of the contractor.  Reclamation does not have land locations for the permanent storage of debris. The China Bar debris collection site consists of a 2,070-foot main earthen dike, a 1,600-foot auxiliary earthen dike, and a number of log booms.  The North, Middle, and South log booms form a string of boom logs that remove debris from the current of the river in a shearing action and together are referred to as the shear boom.  The 2,500-foot North Main Boom consists of a double string of boom logs; each boom log is approximately 33 feet long.  The 950-foot Middle Main Boom consists of a double string of boom logs.  The 2,500-foot South Main Boom consists of a single string of boom logs.  There is a holding area log boom for storage of debris diverted by the main shear boom and a safety log boom to ensure that debris doesn't escape the collection facility.     Government-furnished facilities include storage buildings, a small work shop, basic sanitary facilities, and a small building for day-time use. The Kettle River debris collection boom is located in FDR Lake at the mouth of the Kettle River.  It consists of single-string log booms totaling about 4,500 feet in length and spanning the mouth of the Kettle River.  There is a permanent opening in the log boom for public navigation when the lake elevation is above 1255 feet.  An additional single string of boom logs, approximately 2,800 feet long, forms a liner along the main section of the collection area of the log boom for additional strength to hold collected debris.  It is used to encircle the debris to hold it in place after the collection period and to tow the debris to Boise Cove. The Boise Cove site is located on Lake Roosevelt and is adjacent to Boise Cascade Corporation's log storage yard.   It consists of a log boom of about 45 boom logs in a single string, enclosing a majority of the river cove.  This log boom is used to store bagged debris on the inside.  Government and Contractor flotilla is usually moored around the perimeter.  A concrete access ramp is used for debris removal.  The access ramp must have a lake elevation of approximately 1275 feet or above for equipment to reach the debris. The contractor will have to work with changing river level, current, and velocity in order to maintain and manipulate the log booms, anchors, and buoys for efficient debris collection, debris breach protection, and moorage of flotilla.  Hazardous operating conditions may be encountered on the upper Columbia River.  The contractor also must maintain a few navigational lights.  Preparation for the debris collection season and for the Spring runoff begins April 1st.  Collection, monitoring, and maintenance is ongoing from April 1st, culminating with the removal of debris in late summer or early fall.  Please contact me to register to attend the site visit, that way we know if you're coming or not.  We will convene for the site visit in Kettle Falls at 9:00am Thursday morning at the Chevron Gas and Go Minimart/Truck Stop at the intersection of Highways 25 and 395.  We anticipate that the site visit will take about 3 hours.  This site visit will give potential contractors the opportunity to view the work sites during the river conditions for debris removal.  Attendance at site visit is not mandatory but highly encouraged.  My phone number is 208-378-5105, our fax number is 208-378-5108, and my email address is jhedeen@pn.usbr.gov.

<DESC>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institute of Health (NIH), strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives.  The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics, which are funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.  In this context, the NIAID's mission includes the development of new medical countermeasures against the biological agents that are most likely to be used in a terror attack on civilian populations.  These biological agents have been prioritized as Category A, B, and C.  Through this solicitation the NIAID is seeking to advance the development of therapeutics against selected NIAID Category A, B, and C bacterial pathogens via a focused, staged approach. Specifically the goal of this solicitation is to develop new, safe, and effective therapeutics for:

* Bacillus anthracis
* Yersinia pestis
* Francisella tularensis
* Burkholderia pseudomallei
* Burkholderia mallei
* Rickettsia prowazekii

Pathogens, excluding sexually-transmitted organisms (see http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/anti_stis.htm for list of excluded organisms), resistant to antimicrobial agents were recently added to the NIAID Biodefense Category C priority pathogens list. This solicitation will also support the development of candidate therapeutics with broad spectrum activity against NIAID Category C antimicrobial resistant bacterial pathogen(s) and at least one of the selected Category A or B bacterial pathogens (B. anthracis, Y. pestis, F. tularensis, B. pseudomallei, B. mallei and R. prowazekii). 

The candidate therapeutic should be at a stage of development that is minimally within five (5) years of completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial.  This solicitation will support non-clinical studies, medicinal chemistry, manufacturing, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, and other Investigational New Drug (IND)-, New Drug Application (NDA)-, or Biologic License Application (BLA)-enabling studies.  The NIAID is particularly interested in candidate therapeutics that have broad spectrum activity and are within the regulatory purview of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Review (CDER) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

It is anticipated that multiple cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of up to five (5) years beginning on or about June 12, 2007.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 06-45 Sandblaster:  This BAA will be open only through October 16, 2006.  To be considered, full proposals must be received no later than 4:00 PM local Arlington, Virginia time on October 16, 2006.  Proposals received after 4:00PM local Arlington, Virginia time on October 16, 2006 will be deemed non-responsive and will not be considered.  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the performance of system research, development, design, and testing to support the DARPA Sandblaster program objective.  POC: Dr. Reggie Brothers, DARPA/STO; Email: BAA06-45@darpa.mil; Website: http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/Sandblaster/index.htm

 

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:  Sandblaster is a high priority effort to develop and demonstrate effective affordable solutions to the problem of helicopter landing in BROWNOUT as well as other Degraded Visual Environments (DVE).  Solutions are urgently needed for the brownout phenomenon, which causes deadly accidents during helicopter landing and take-off operations in arid desert terrain.  Intense, blinding dust clouds stirred up by the aircraft's main-rotor down-wash during near-ground flight can cause helicopter pilots to suddenly lose all visual cues.  This creates significant flight safety risks from aircraft and ground obstacle collisions, rollover due to sloped and uneven terrain, etc.  Sandblaster is focused on the rapid development and demonstration of sensor/visualization-display systems that will effectively provide an affordable, landing capability in brownout/DVE conditions where the visibility is temporarily as low as zero with zero landing-zone infrastructure and limited knowledge of the terrain comprising the landing area.  Sandblaster must be affordable and self-contained, and include necessary sensors, instruments and displays to provide robust effective landing guidance to the pilot.  Sandblaster must be compatible with upgrading existing military rotorcraft like the UH-60 Blackhawk.  System A-Kit must be configurable to integrate with MH/UH-60 A/L/M Blackhawk Helicopters.

 

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for Sandblaster.  The objective of the Sandblaster program is to enable rotary wing aircraft to land safely in brown-out conditions with a minimum of pilot and/or crew compensation.  The desired system will, at a minimum, provide brownout landing capability in zero/zero visibility conditions with warning of lateral, fore and aft drift, of ground obstacles and sloping/uneven terrain in the landing zone that could induce dynamic roll-over, and of potential collisions with other nearby aircraft and building structures.  The desired system will be applicable to other DVEs (Fog, Rain, Snow).  Landing guidance will come from conventional/modified instrumentation, new human-factored, cognitive Primary Functional Displays, or combination of both.  The system must be able to provide the following information: aircraft rate of descent; absolute height above the ground with accuracy goal of 1ft (when below 50ft altitude); and drift velocity with accuracy goal of 1 kt and drift direction accuracy goal of 1 degree.  The desired system will include sensing and display elements that will be able to be fully integrated in the MH/UH-60 Blackhawk platform.  It is highly desirable that methods for incorporating the Sandblaster capability into MH/UH-60A/L/M models and legacy military helicopters to be identified.  The contractor must provide suggested addendum inputs to the UH-60 Operators Manual (TM1-1520-237-10), along with suggested video training resources and instruction sets, as part the deliverables of this effort.  The desired system must be able to be developed quickly on a rapid success-oriented schedule.  The desired system must be affordable in volume production: the proposer must provide production cost analysis and estimates for the volume system cost for a UH-60M sized fleet buy. 

 

Full-scale test data on dust concentrations and particle size distributions of the brownout dust clouds for MH/UH-60 class helicopters (and other legacy helicopters) have been measured at the Yuma Test Center dust range.  This technical background information was made available to the proposers at the Proposers? Conference in briefings, and will also be provided in a Supplemental Information Package (Distribution Notice Code  X: Distribution authorized to US Government Agencies and private individuals or enterprises eligible to obtain export-controlled technical data in accordance with DoD Directive 5230.25).  All Conference attendees and Supplemental Information Package recipients are required to show eligibility to obtain such data.

 

The Government will fund and conduct range tests and Sandblaster system effectiveness evaluations at Government facilities, with appropriate test support from the Sandblaster system developers.  Initial assessments of system effectiveness will be evaluated in a Government specified and funded flight simulator (such as the NASA Ames Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS)) and in the US Army JUH-60A RASCAL testbed. These evaluations will be based on pilot-in-the-loop handling quality ratings (Cooper Harper rating scale) when performing brown-out approach and landing as well as other Army Design Standard 33 maneuvers (e.g. hover, lateral reposition).  Novel approaches to using cognitive and physiological assessment of pilot workload may be included in the system evaluation to increase our understanding of pilot reactions to the landing environment.  Task performance time, sink rate at touchdown, lateral velocity at touchdown (ideally zero), forward velocity at touchdown (ideally minimal) and course/altitude profile deviation during approach will be measured.  It is highly desirable that the system provide the desired situational awareness in degraded visual environments other than brownout as well.  Rather than using military helicopters and pilots, the Government may elect to conduct field evaluations of an installed Sandblaster system in a commercial helicopter under brownout conditions using contractor pilots at the US Army Yuma Test Center dust range.  

 

 The Government encourages responses to this BAA by non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for organizations of a specific business classification due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per PL 103-337 Section 217 and PL 105-261 Section 3136.  Any responsible and otherwise qualified offeror is encouraged to respond.

 

Under the Sandblaster BAA, DARPA prefers and is requesting proposals for the award of a procurement contract.  However other award instruments may be considered if they are found to be in the best interests of the Government. 

 

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government also reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received; in that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.

 

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this project are: (a) Technical Approach, including estimated system performance and schedule; (b) System Affordability; (c) Relevant Experience with development of integrated sensor and pilot display system development, and with helicopter system integration (particularly UH-60 aircraft); (d) Management Approach, including detailed schedule and risk management for rapid system prototyping; (e) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA mission; and (f) Cost Reasonableness and Realism for the system development and for recurring production. Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.

 

SECURITY:  The Government anticipates that proposals submitted under this BAA will be UNCLASSIFIED.

<DESC>Contract Extension SYNOPSIS: NOTICE OF INTENT The U. S. Department of Energy, Savannah River Operations Office, published a Sources Sought /Request for Information synopsis in June 2005, reference solicitation number DERI09-05SR22470.  The synopsis announced that the planning for a competitive solicitation and award of a contract for the management and operation of the Savannah River Site was under way.  On December 16, 2005, DOE issued its general Acquisition Strategy in which DOE indicated its intention to conduct two major contract competitions: (1) a full and open competition for a site management and operating (M&O) contract, including operation of the Savannah River National Laboratory but excluding operation of the liquid waste system; and, (2) a full and open competition for a contract for operation of the Liquid Waste system.  This announcement furthers the implementation of that Acquisition Strategy.  To enable the Department to continue its critical mission at Savannah River Operations Office during the solicitation and award phases of these competitive acquisitions, and in order to allow the acquisition cycle time required to adequately foster full and open competition and award successor contracts for these highly complex requirements, the Department intends to extend the existing contract with Washington Savannah River Company, LLC, (WSRC) for up to 18 months effective January 1, 2007.  This extension is required to provide uninterrupted site support while the competitive procurement is completed.  Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) the Department has determined that due to the critical need for uninterrupted support, only one responsible source exists to satisfy the agencyâ€™s immediate requirements for the limited period of time necessary to conduct the full and open competitions for the M&O and Liquid Waste services.  See Government-wide numbered note 22.

In accordance with AMS policy 3.2.2.4, the FAA is notifying the public of its intent to make a single source award to Environmental Tectonics Corporation, who conducted hardware and software development of a short arm centrifuge based simulator and developed generic upset recovery training procedures using the device.  In July 2005 the FAA conducted market research and as a result, the FAA determined that Environmental Tectonics Corporation, 125 James Way, Southampton, PA 18966-3877 is the only contactor with the current capabilities required to meet this requirement.  ETC was the only respondent that demonstrated capability in this area.  Due to the proprietary nature of the equipment, there is no alternative source for this requirement. This announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA.   No entitlement to payment or direct or indirect costs or charges to the FAA shall arise as a result of submission of responses to this announcement, and the FAA's use of such information.  A competitive solicitation will not be available for this procurement.  This announcement is for information purposes only.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price purchase order to AeroVironment, Inc., 900 Enchanted Way, Simi Valley, CA 93065 for the procurement of 6 RQ-11B Raven Small Unmanned Air Vehicle (SUAV) rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, part number 54677.  The purchase order will include an option for up to an additional 14 batteries of the same make and model. Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) interoperability has become of great interest to the UAS operator community and the Department of Defense.  The Marine Corps is pursuing procurement of the RQ-11B Raven through the U.S. Army’s contract W58RGZ-05-C-0338.  The Raven B Small Unmanned Air Vehicle (SUAV) is powered by a re-chargeable lithium-ion battery, part number 54677.  To maximize the full mission capability, the batteries intended for use in the SUAV must be authorized for Naval Shipboard interoperability.  To receive this authorization, the batteries intended for usage with the SUAV must pass Naval Ordnance Safety and Security Activity (NOSSA) safety certification testing conducted at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Carderock, Maryland.  AeroVironment is currently the only source producing batteries for the Raven B, therefore it is necessary they provide the batteries for certification testing.  If the AeroVironment batteries are not tested for NOSSA certification, they w!  ill not be eligible for transport aboard Naval vessels when the Raven B SUAV system is fielded by the Marine Corps.  No Request for Proposal (RFP) is available for competitive bidding, however, interested parties may submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement no later than close of business on 18 September 2006 to the contact person listed above.  Numbered Note 22 applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command Headquarters, Aircrew Systems Program Office (PMA202) intends to procure by full and open competition the flotation assembly portion of the Helicopter Egress System for Passengers (HESP).  HESP will be used for Marine Corps troops being transported over water in rotary wing aircraft.  HESP consists of a flotation ensemble that includes the flotation assembly, emergency air supply holster and survival item pouch.  The flotation ensemble incorporates performance improvements over the current in-service flotation device, the LPU-32/P.  HESP will provide increased buoyancy and will integrate with the currently fielded Outer Tactical Vest (OTV) and the new Modular Tactical Vest (MTV) and its single point release system.  The emergency air bottle and survival items are Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and will not be part of the procurement.  The Government intends to award a single contract which will cover a one-year base period plus four one-year option periods. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for the supplies and services anticipated herein is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing; the Federal Supply Code is 4220, Marine Lifesaving and Diving Equipment. The projected procurement quantity is 19,839 HESP units over the potential 5 year period, plus the associated documentation. The type of contract to be awarded shall be Firm Fixed Price, and the required delivery of these units shall be not greater than 4 months after award/exercise of option at an approximate average rate of 400 per month. Deliveries shall be received at designated government facilities throughout CONUS.

Interested sources who intend to compete for this solicitation must be able to demonstrate their ability to satisfy the form, fit, function, and interface requirements when worn by a fully outfitted combat ready Marine wearing either the OTV and MTV; meet operational and environmental requirements, demonstrate the ability to meet the production capacity and deliver sample units that do not require extensive modification or development.   Interested sources must also demonstrate their ability to provide spare parts and replacement systems through commercial sources as well as instructions on use, maintenance and repair.  Minimum capabilities should include the ability to provide 65 pounds of buoyancy; one size fits all; manual inflation of the flotation; a system that allows donning and doffing of the flotation, emergency air source (air bottle) and survival item pouch together as a unit.

Criteria for proposals received in response to this solicitation will be available in Section L of the forthcoming Request For Proposal (RFP). Evaluation criteria for the solicitation will be available in Section M of the forthcoming RFP. Offerors will be required to submit 5 production representative units with their proposal.  NAVAIR intends to conduct the evaluation of proposals utilizing the written proposals as well as the sample units. The Government will conduct testing on the 5 sample units.  Testing to be conducted will be listed in Section C of the forthcoming RFP.  After evaluations have been conducted, the Navy intends to down-select to one (1) responsible offeror who has best demonstrated the capability to produce the HESP in accordance with the performance specification and the stated evaluation criteria. A Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) quantity of 30 systems will be purchased and for a fleet assessment to evaluate use of the system in an aircraft fully loaded with troop passengers.  Upon successful completion of the fleet assessment the full rate production contract shall be awarded.  It is anticipated that the initial contact award shall take place in or around March 2007.

NAVAIR intends to use Non-Government personnel in the source selection for this effort. Non-Government personnel will have the need to access proposals in order to support evaluation and selection for the Government. Therefore, before an award, it may be necessary for the solicited company to enter into non-disclosure agreements with these individual companies. A prerequisite for receiving a contract award will be registration in DOD?s Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by this agency. Questions with regards to this forthcoming solicitation shall be addressed by electronic mail only to Stella Obayuwana at stella.obayuwana@.navy.mil; no phone calls or faxes please.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center(NSWCIH), Indian Head, MD. intends to award a Sole Source Purchase Order to Thermo Electron Corporation for a Bolometer Detector.  This detector will be used to monitor far-infrared signals using fourier-transform interferometric spectroscopy. The special range of interest is 700cm-1 to 50cm-1. The bolometer and optics, including a solid-substrate beamsplitter must be professionally installed. In the far-insfrared, water vapor aborption is deleterious to signal acquisition.  The detector should flush-mount to the existing Nicolet 870 FTIR spectrometer to allow for a continous nitrogen purge. Thermo Electron Corporation makes the Nicolet 870 FTIR spectrometer and reutinely adds far-IR detection capability to this type of system. Thermo Electron Corporation is the only source of bolometer that can integrate its detector in to an exissting Nicolet 870 FTIR spectrometer that NSWC Indian Head has. No other bolometer from other sources will wo!  rk properly in regards to software control, timing, gain, and detection setup. The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is 334413 with a size standard of 500 employees. The FSC code is 5865.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposal as being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   RFQ N00189-06-T-0337 is issued as a  Request for Quote.   This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12. The FSC is 41, the NAICS code for this requirement is 423730.  The Contracting Department at FISC Norfolk intends to purchase on a full and open competitive basis the following item:  0001, 1 each,  Brand Name or Equal to Trane, 100 Ton, Air Cooled Helical rotary Chiller, Model #RTAA-100.  Salient characteristics:    Replacement chiller that will interface with the existing Johnson Controls Metasys DDC System.  The replacement system   will require a conduit run for the LON wire from chiller to the DDC control panel.   The unit requires 460 volt/60 hertz/3 phase electrical connections.  The unit must comply with efficiency requirements of  ASHRAE Standard 90.1-1999 and CAN/CSA C743-02.   Because of the need for form and fit, the unit shall fit on the existing cement pad that measures 234? x 90? and work in conjunction with the existing 140 Ton Trane Chiller already installed at the facility.  Installation of the unit will include all necessary services to install and interface the unit.  Installation shall also include all materials for piping, wiring of new unit to existing building structures and interface as described, as well as demolition of the old chiller that is being replaced.   

Definition and specifications of LON:  LonWorks is a networking platform specifically created to address the unique performance, reliability, installation, and maintenance needs of control applications. The platform is built on a low bandwidth protocol created by Echelon Corporation for networking devices over media such as twisted pair, powerlines, fiber optics and RE. It is popular for the automation of various functions within buildings such as lightIng and HVAC.

Manufacturers in a variety of industries including building, home, transportation, utility, and industrial automation have adopted the platform as the basis for their product and service offerings. To date, thousands of companies have built products and applications on top of the platform, performing such diverse functions as embedded machine control, municipal and highway street lighting, heating and air conditioning systems, intelligent electricity metering, subway train control, stadium lighting and speaker control, security systems, fire detection and suppression, and newborn location monitoring and alarming.

The platform has its origins with chip designs, power line and twisted pair signaling technology, routers, network management software, and other products from Echelon Corporation. In 1999 the communications protocol (then known as LonTalk) was submitted to ANSI and accepted as a standard for control networking (ANSIJEIA7O9.1-B). Echelon?s power line and twisted pair signaling technology was also submitted to ANSI for standardization and accepted. Since then, ANSI/E1A709. I has been accepted as the basis for IEEE 1473 -L (in-train controls), AAR Electro-pneumatic braking systems for freight trains, IFSF (European petrol station control), SEMI (semiconductor equipment manufacturing), and in January 2005 as prENl49O8 (European building automation, preliminary standard). The protocol is also one of data link/physical layers of the BACnet ASHRAE/ANSJ standard for building automation.

The LonWorks platform also has an affiliated 11, tunneling standard, EIA-852, in use by a number of manufacturers to connect the devices on previously deployed and new LonWorks based networks to IP aware applications or remote network management tools.

The ANSI/EIA7O9. 1 standard document is available from ANSI and reference implementations are available online for porting the protocol to a variety of processors. Alternatively, microchips that have the protocol logic hard-wired in are available from a number of suppliers either as stand-alone integrated circuits (IC) or as a combined integrated circuit/transceiver. In Lonworks these IC?s are known as ?Neurons?.

<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Contract on a Sole Source basis to GVS-Grande Vitesse Inc., 390 Fremond St., San Francisco, CA 94105-9275 for nine (9) each of the GVS9000 Power Mac G5 computers.  These computers are required to support the CLUSTER REVERB Program.  They will be incorporated into deployable REVERB systems as well as be used for spare parts.  The GVS9000 computer is the only make/model computer that meets the requirements of the CLUSTER REVERB Program.  The Government plans to issue a request for written quote to GVS-Grande Vitesse, Inc. using FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.  The anticipated award date is 22 September 2006.  This action is being processed on a Sole  Source basis due to the fact that use of a different make and model computer other than the GVS9000 would require a revision to the Technical Data Packages that are are required for installation of CLUSTER REVERB on board deploying boats.  The TDP (Technical Data Package) is a blueprint of the REVERB system and includes electrical connections between internal REVERB system components and ship?s components.  Additionally specific GVS9000 operational capabilities are included REVERB Operation and Maintenance Manuals that have already been developed; use of a different make/model computer would require a second version of these manuals.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis services regarding Promoter Hypermethyaltion in the Argentine Bladder Cancer Tumor Marker Study with Transgenomic Inc., 12325 Emmet Street, Omaha, Nebraska 68164.

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with FAR Part 12 with the authority to use simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M.  This acquisition is set aside for a Total Small Business.  

The purpose of this requisition is to analyze promoter hypermethylation status in DNA from 28 cases that were exposed to varied levels of arsenic in drinking water.  CpG sites within the promoter region of ten genes will be analyzed to determine whether each promoter is hypermethylated and potentially silenced by exposure to arsenic in drinking water.

Transgenomic, Inc. conducted the pilot study using samples from the Argentina Case-control study MQ515301. They developed novel methods to bisulfite treat and sequence all CpG sites in the promoter region and are to our knowledge the only laboratory using this method. Therefore, because of comparability of these results to those of the previous pilot study with these unique methods developed, Transgenomic Inc. is the only source to conduct the analysis of these samples.  

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on September 15, 2006.  For further information please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).   Reference NCI-60196-NG.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis, the brand name Miltenyi Biotec autoMACS Separation Unit, automated cell sorter, laminar hood set, and related accessories: (model numbers: 130-090-273, 130-090-333, 130-090-334, 130-090-337, and 130-090-775) or equal. 

This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12, under the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements as provided in FAR 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

Statement of Work:  Contractor shall provide the Miltenyi Biotec autoMACS Separation Unit, automated cell sorter, laminar hood set and related accessories or equal.  

1	The following salient characteristics apply:

1)	Magnetically sort cells isolating specific sub-populations or cells or virus from larger heterogeneous populations.
2)	Positive selection or depletion of biomolecules without effecting functions or viability.
3)	Shall consist of a microprocessor-controlled syringe pump, magnets, and replaceable column matrices for cell separation.
4)	Positive pressure delivery which eliminates frustration of a gravity-fed system.
5)	Shall not be more than five (5) square feet, four (4) feet wide and three                     (3) feet deep.	
	
2	Delivery: 	Contractor shall deliver the item within thirty (30) days after award to: NIH/NCI Bethesda, Maryland 20892.  Upon delivery, contractor must notify the NCI Project Officer to schedule the delivery date and time.  

3	Installation: 	Contractor shall install the equipment and have ready to use within                                                                            		seven (7) days after delivery.

4           Training: 	Contractor shall provide training (at no additional cost to the Government) on proper use of equipment, software and related use for one (1) NCI researcher at above location within one week of installation.

5	Payment:	Payment shall be made after delivery and installation of equipment, upon 		Government acceptance. 

Justification: The AutoMACS system uses magnets as the separation mechanism to isolate certain cell lines from larger populations of cells.  This mechanism allows for a greater range of separation to take place based on the parameters set forth in the experiments.  The magnetic approach to cell separation allows for a larger cell population that is able to continue functioning without signification cell mortality.  Results from previous experiments will therefore be comparable to future results, without costly and timely retesting.  Much of the laboratory research involves the separation and counting of various cell lines and types.  The purchase of the AutoMACS Separation unit is vital to the research being conducted currently and of that in the future.  

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendor?s responsibility to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractor must have valid registration/certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: The Science Engineering Associates Multi-gravity research flight guidance will interface to NASA owned Science Engineering Associates (SEA) M300 data acquisition system. The hardware and software of the SEA M300 data acquisition system is proprietary to SEA and therefore no other vendor would be able to provide this type of system. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 9/11/2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>This synopsis is being provided to publish a requirement for the Office Research and Development (ORD) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Risk Management Laboratory (NRMRL) in Edison, New Jersey which is seeking a contractor to perform the following tasks related to the identification and treatment of Emerging Contaminants (EC) in Wet Weather Flows (WWF). The contractor shall perform a comprehensive review of the literature for existing research on the types, amounts, and detection frequencies of ECs in WWF; analytical techniques; and, documented attempts to treat these contaminants.  A number of processes have historically been used in the control and treatment of WWF including: screening, disinfection, biological filtration, hydrodynamic separation, sedimentation, detention ponds, swales, and advanced filtration using a wide range of natural and synthetic media.  In addition to the literature review, a technical report shall be prepared that will identify the quality and quantity characteristics of ECs, emphasizing relative abundance, frequency of detection, toxicity, harmful effects of ECs and EC categories (pharmaceuticals, personal care products, household products, etc.) and relevant unit processes documented for treatment and control technologies, including any limitations of the designs on removal effectiveness of ECs from WWF.   The technical report shall describe both the benefits and limitations of the different types of treatment approaches including which technologies may have the best possible EC removal expectations when used either by itself or combined, such as, when used in either a treatment train or an integrated unit package plant design.  The report shall also prioritize the order of EC categories to abate and the associated treatment methods to pursue.      Based on the information obtained from the literature search and technical report, the contractor shall develop and conduct appropriate bench-scale treatability tests to investigate and document the removal of ECs using both conventional approaches and other more novel techniques that may be suggested from the literature search, including the possible application of materials such as zero valent iron (Fe0) and nanogels. Effective treatability of WWF pollutants, both organic and inorganic, relates to the constituents ability to associate with different particle sizes which relates to settling or filterable characteristics.  Treatability also relates to the ability of the dissolved constituent to be sorbed onto media such as those used in ion exchange.  It is expected that treatability testing will most likely involve techniques for sedimentation/filtration and other techniques that more readily apply to dissolved vs. suspended constituents.  The treatability tests shall use actual WWF obtained from urban areas that are most likely to contain ECs in high enough concentrations so as to make the sampling and analytical measurement possible without the use of exotic or untested materials or apparatus. The contractor shall deliver a final project report to the EPA along with a PowerPoint presentation suitable for informing EPA technical staff and others about the activities conducted under this project and the contractor shall prepare a draft journal article that summarizes the project approach and results.  Upon EPA review and approval, the contractor shall submit the article to an appropriate journal. The North American Industry Classification Code is 541690 with a small business size standard of $6.5 million.  A written solicitation, PR-CI-06-11202, is anticipated to be issued the week of September 25th 2006.  It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued as a request for quotes (RFQ).  All responsible businesses may submit a quotation in response to the solicitation which shall be considered by the Agency.  This procurement will be pursued using FAR Part 12 Commercial Acquisition methods and procedures.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.   The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  In addition to price, the following factors may be used to evaluate the offeror?s technical proposal: relevant technical experience, quality of personnel, facilities and resources, and past performance.  These factors shall be evaluated on a Best Value basis.  Contract type is anticipated to be time and material.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) located in Ann Arbor, MI, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with A & D Technology, Inc. of Ann Arbor, Michigan for Warranty of the A & D Technology Engine Combustion Cycle Characterization Analysis System (ECCCAS) under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b). A & D Technology developed and installed the Engine Combustion Cycle Characterization Analysis System (ECCCAS) at the EPA Ann Arbor Facility.  EPA accepted the ECCCAS on September 6, 2005.  The one (1) year warranty that was provided with the equipment has expired and EPA intends to issue an order for A & D Technology to provide extended warranty services.  A & D Technology will warranty all parts, labor, control systems, and equipment for the performance and functionality of the system for a minimum of one (1) base year and three (3) option years.  The warranty will provide for on-site, cost-free repair or replacement of failed components, to include material, labor and all associated expenses.  A & D Technology will be on-site in response to a service call within two (2) working days.   This requirement will utilize FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  It has been determined that A & D Technology is the sole source for the ECCCAS extended warranty due to the proprietary nature of the equipment they installed.   THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing an Extended Warranty for the Engine Combustion Cycle Characterization and Analysis System developed and installed by A & D Technology that meets the work identified above may submit technical documentation to establish their capability.  Such documentation must be submitted to Scott Tharp, Contracting Officer, within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Scott Tharp via Fax (513) 487-2107 or email Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-EDOSDF-06-900709
<RESPDATE>092006
<ARCHDATE>10052006
<CONTACT>See Description for Contact Information, See 'Description, Phone See Description, Fax See Description, Email See Description
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (Department) intends to award a purchase order to procure services for the analysis of State reports required under the Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA), which was enacted in October 1994 and reauthorized as Part A, Subpart 3 under Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary and Education Act (ESEA), as amended (20 U.S.C. 7151).  The specific purpose of this procurement is to aggregate and analyze data from the GFSA State reports for 2005-2006 and to prepare a detailed final report.  The final report must include an examination of data published in reports covering collections from previous reporting years.  The report includes, but is not limited to, a description of the number of students expelled by local education agencies within States in compliance with the GFSA, as well as other information related to the types of firearms involved, referrals to alternative placements, and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) status of expelled students.  Westat is the principle organization with considerable expertise in collecting and analyzing GFSA data.  This purchase order is intended as a sole source award to be made to Westat in Rockville, Maryland.  

Sole Source Justification:

The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) was reauthorized under Section 4141 of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (20 U.S.C. 7151) and requires each State receiving ESEA funds to have in effect a State law requiring local educational agencies (LEAs) to expel from school for a period of not less than one year a student found to have brought a firearm to school, or to have possessed a firearm at a school.  The GFSA also requires LEAs that receive ESEA funds to adopt a policy requiring referral to the criminal justice or juvenile delinquency system of any student who brings a firearm to school or possesses a firearm at school.  Each year, States are required to report to the Secretary of Education concerning implementation of the GFSA requirements.  
 
The Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools proposes to pay $25,000 to Westat to collect and analyze the data submitted by States for the 2005-2006 school year.  Westat will also develop a final report that provides a detailed examination of the data found in the GFSA State reports.  Over the past nine (9) years, States have submitted GFSA reports in a required format.  Data have been collected by Westat for the 1995-96 through 2004-2005 school years over this timeframe.  The quality and accuracy of the data has been a recurring problem.  As a result, a considerable amount of time and effort is required to verify the data submitted and analyze data that is not necessarily comparable from state to state but, at the same, time make comparisons that will provide a national picture of the implementation of the GFSA and compliance.  Data contained in the GFSA report is receiving increasing scrutiny from the Congress, the media, and the public.  

The unusual and compelling need for this particular data collection activity is consistent with the requirements of FAR 13.104(b).  Because of the complexity of the data and the need for expert knowledge in the area of GFSA reporting, it would be extremely productive and cost effective to utilize the expertise of a source that is familiar with the issues related to this specific data collection.  Westat has the experience and knowledge that is unique to other sources that specialize in data collection in that it has built a knowledge base on the issues of the GFSA and an effective system that responds immediately to the urgent needs of this collection activity.  For this reason the continued use of Westat is crucial to meeting the needs of this Department.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) intend to procure on a sole-source basis with the Karolinska Institute, Department of Medical Epidemiology, Stockholm, Sweden, for a one year base period with a one year option, for data on 300 IgM MGUS cases diagnosed in Northern and Eastern Sweden between 1985 and the present.    The DCEG has recently conducted a population-based case-control study on multiple myeloma (MM) using linked registry data from Sweden. Compared with controls, risk of MM was almost 2-fold significantly increased in relatives of cases. Risks were close to 4-fold elevated among female relatives and relatives of female MM probands. Relatives of MM cases had an elevated risk of Waldenstrom?s macroglobulinemia (WM)  and monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS), but the numbers were too small for statistical analysis. For these studies to continue to be successful and maximally informative, it is necessary that the DCEG expands its studies by using integrated detailed clinical, diagnostic/prognostic and population-based data with a long-term follow-up. To accomplish this goal to estimate personal/familial risks of lymphorproliferative (LP) development among MGUS cases and their relatives (compared to controls) and to examine the association between MGUS and autoimmune conditions in a timely fashion, the DCEG is planning to conduct a case-control study including IgM MGUS cases, their matched controls and first-degree relatives of cases and controls.  MGUS was originally defined by Dr. Waldenstr?m?s group at Malmo University Hospital in Sweden in the 1950s, reflected in a early nationwide interests in MGUS among active clinicians. Thus a large number of MGUS can be identified in Sweden. The specific objectives of the contract are to: 1) Create a database containing 300 IgM MGUS cases diagnosed in Northern and Eastern Sweden between January 1, 1985 and the present;  2)  Collect unique ID numbers, name, and date of diagnosis for each case in order to allow linkage with central and regional databases; and 3)Collect clinical and laboratory data for each case.  The Karolinska Institute has access to unique MGUS data (a total of >1000 cases including all Ig subtypes) collected at Karolinska. This data goes back until mid-1980s. Access to the this data will significantly strengthen our planned familial study.  There is no other contractor known to the NCI Researcher that has the access to a MGUS cohort of over 1000 cases including Ig subtypes that goes back in to the 1980?s.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 20, 2006.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor?s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  	RT-CES2-16X Analyzer

Purpose/Brief History:

The POB performs research in the general area of cancer research, including assessments of cell growth, differentiation, morphology, cell activation, tumorigenicity and effects  of various therapeutic agents on the growth of tumor cells in vitro. 

Real-time assessments of the response of cells to various conditions is essential in determining the efficacy of a given treatment and establishing critical time points at which molecular mechanisms regulating survival and death may be operant. 

The RT-CES2-16x Analyzer from ACEA Biosciences offers a label-free, real-time assessment of cell survival, death and response to various biologic response modifiers. The measurement process is automatic, simple, homogeneous, non-invasive, and free from the use of all labels and reporters. Each well incorporates a gold circle-on-line microelectrode array.  Since 80% of the bottom of the well is covered by the electrode, measurements accurately represent the behavior of all cells present.  Well to well CVs are typically around 10%.

When a mild alternating current is passed through the electrode array it is possible to measure the impedance of the circuit.  The impedance (and calculated Cell Index) varies as the cells change over time.

The cells can be observed in a microscope at any stage of the experiment.

The sensor analyzer and software control the signal generation, plus data acquisition and analysis.  The assay format is based on a standard 96 well plate.  The instrument will accommodate up to six 16 well plates. This machine fits into standard laboratory incubators. 

Many biological events can be studied based on these measured changes in impedance as cells grow on the microelectrode array they include:  cell proliferation, cell growth rates, cell viability, cell morphology, cell adhesion, cell motion, cell differentiation, apoptosis, cytotoxicity, viral infection, cell activation, GPCR activation, receptor tyrosine kinase activation, cell transfection, etc

PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

The POB is proposing to procure the RT-CES2-16X system because it is the only machine that makes real-time measurements based on impedance that integrates with currently available tissue culture systems. No other system has the versatility to assess the dynamic range of cell functions as the RT-CES2-16X.

<DESC>In accordance with simplified acquisition procedures the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with the Kaiser Foundation Research Institute, Center for Health Research, 3800 N. Interstate Ave., Portland, OR 97227-1110 for their continued support in the development of specialized tissue microarray by providing information on their collection of colorectal cancer and polyps of the colon.  The CDP has supported the development of specialized tissue microarrays to allow for the efficient study of prognostic markers. A continuing need exists to find appropriate resources of archived cancer tissue. Such resources are not common, particularly as pathology departments seek to conserve resources by discarding older cases. In addition, the collection of specimens must be linked to credible and extensive data about the clinical and pathologic characteristics of the original specimen together with a reasonably long period of follow-up to gauge the ultimate prognostic value of any molecular marker. Kaiser Permanente, Northwest Division (KPNW) has a very valuable collection of colorectal cancer and polyps of the colon.  This procurement will support pathologic assessment of benign polyps of the colon diagnosed and pathologically removed at Kaiser Permanente during the period 1985-2000 for the production of tissue microarrays and to link them with a database that includes the important variables specified by the College of American Pathology and the clinical and outcome data from the KPNW Tumor Registry.  These tissue blocks will be supplied to the NCI for production of NCI-designed tissue microarrays.  If the individuals from whom the polyps were removed have developed a subsequent colon or rectal cancer, the malignancy will also be included.  This is the continuation of an on-going project, previously Kaiser Permanente, Northwest Division provided cases of colon and rectal cancers to be incorporated in tissue microarrays.  This yielded 2975 Colon and 853 Rectal cancers newly diagnosed between 1970 and 2000.  This procurement will allow them to evaluate polyps and match them with colon cancer cases to provide exceptionally valuable materials for research on colon cancer progression.  This is a unique collection and the continuation of an ongoing project.  There are no other collections available with the extent and quality of clinical follow-up data known to the NCI Researcher. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  	Nuance Camera For Multispectral Quantitative Optical Imaging.
Project Background and Description 

The mission of the TARP to develop tissue based biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of response to therapy.  They have developed a number of biomarkers that require sensitive quantification by immunohistochemistry.   Accurate quantification of immunohistochemistry is challenging because it requires resolving elements of  images both in reference to color from contrast agents and stains, but other indogenous properties. The TARP Lab often desires to quantify multiple stains at once either in fluorescence or brightfield imaging. 
A significant limitation of the current work is that current camera technology does not allow us to unmix color into individual spectrum.  By upgrading to a multispectral camera we will be able to quantitate staining rather than use subjective estimates by eye. The only multispectral camera available for bright field and fluorescence imaging is the Nuance camera by CRI.  .
The Nuance camera is capable of performing spectroscopic optical imaging from approximately 450nm to 800nm in increments.  The emission filter is based on liquid crystal technology and is completely adjustable.  The camera is compatible with multiple light sources (fluorescence and brightfield, as well as multiple microscopes from different manufacturers.  The unit comes with its own customized software capable of acquiring spectroscopic ?cubes? and unmixing color

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  	ACEA CES2-16X with CIM Station- a PC controlled device for  Measurement of Cell  growth, migration, adhesion, proliferation, viability, morphology, invasion, cell differentiation, chemotaxsis, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and cell activation in label free cells on a real time basis over the course of the experiment(multiple data points not just an endpoint). It can also measure GPCR activation, receptor tyrosine kinase activation and cell transfection.

Purpose/Brief History:
The Lab of Pathology at the National Cancer Institute has a need to acquire an ACEA CES2-16X with CIMStation. This instrument is used to observe in real time and without radioactive labels several parameters of cell growth such as cell growth, migration, adhesion, proliferation, viability, morphology , invasion, cell differentiation, chemotaxsis, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and cell activation. It can also measure GPCR activation, receptor tyrosine kinase activation, and cell transfection.
                  
The ACEA CES2-16X is able to do these assays on significantly smaller cell numbers of cells (5 to 10 times less) than the current technology which makes it more usable in many more assays that would  employ primary cell lines harvested from transgenic mice which are very difficult to grow outside the animal.  This ability to assay with far fewer cells (5,000 to 10,000 cells instead of needing 50,000 to 100,000 cells per treatment condition) is of paramount importance especially when testing transgenic mice since the sacrifice of one mouse is required for each 100,000 endothelial cells needed. 
.
This instruments assays are much more stable and consistent because it has a module that fits inside the incubator where the cells are grown and can send info about cell changes as they grow and metabolize on a real time basis. It can send data about cell conditions at multiple points in time with only one experiment rather than needing several different time endpoints to determine desired data. Because of the uniform conditions inside the cell incubator this instrument gives better statistical reliability of assay data and more info about the cells over time.

The LP believes that the acquisition of this equipment would allow them to do assays on cells previously unavailable in sufficient numbers to assay by older methods. It would also provide much more reliable data and in a much greater volume and faster time while sacrificing fewer animals than anything now available.


PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

As Stated above ACEA Biosciences is the only manufacturer of such an instrument which allows assays of various cellular functions on such small numbers of cells and provides such reliable consistency of results. This machine employs patented technology that allows these assays to be carried out on such small numbers of cells. The number of cells required for alternative techniques is a severe limitation on the types and amounts of tissues we can do these assays on and thus currently prevents certain experiments on transgenic mice altogether.

<DESC>The VA Hospital is seeking qualified contractors to provide and install a new condensing unit (qty. 1) for the Animal Research Facility.  The existing unit is a  split system with 2 condensing units that are integral to the existing  air handling unit and its operation.  This unit is an HCFC-22 system utilizing Oil-22 for the refrigerant circuits.  Contractors must integrate the new condensing unit into the existing Trane system as to not interrupt the operation of the system. Animal Research Condensing Unit Replacement Specifications: Removal and disposal of refrigerant and oil using EPA certified technicians and equipment. Removal and disposal of existing condensing unit. Provide all rigging services for installation. New unit shall conform to existing platform  Provide qty. 1 new  30 ton condensing unit (reuse existing disconnect) to include:  New unit shall have hot gas bypass capability.  Tag Data - Air-Cooled Condensing Units (Commercial) (Qty: 1) Item Tag(s) Qty Description Model Number A1 CU-30T 1 30 Ton Air-Cooled Condensing Unit RAUCC30EB Product Data - Air-Cooled Condensing Units (Commercial) Item: A1  Qty: 1  Tag(s): CU-30T 	30 Ton Unit 	200 Volt 60 Hertz 3 Phase 	Low ambient damper(s) control 	UL/ CSA approval 	Suction service valve Re-pipe unit, reconnect electrical, leak check, evacuate and charge unit with recovered refrigerant. Provide startup services with first year parts and labor warranty. Control Wiring  	1) Existing control wiring unit has 120 volt.  Any changes or upgrades is the contractors responsibility.  General All condensing units are factory assembled and wired. Unit frames are constructed of 14 gauge welded galvanized steel with 14 and 16 gauge galvanized steel panels and access doors. The unit surface is phosphatized and finished with an air-dry paint to withstand 672 hours of continuous salt spray solution in accordance with ASTM B117. Decorative louvered panels provide condenser coil protection. Compressors Trane 3-D Scroll compressors have simple mechanical design with only three (3) major moving parts. Scroll type compression provides inherently low vibration. 3-D compressors provide a completely enclosed compression chamber with no leakage paths.  The compressor is suction gas cooled, direct drive, 3600 RPM hermetic motors. The Scroll compressor includes a centrifugal oil pump, oil level sight glass, and an oil charging valve. Refrigerant Management Split systems can have significantly more refrigerant than packaged systems and thus require controls to reliably manage this excess refrigerant.  Each compressor shall have crankcase heaters installed, properly sized to minimize the amount of liquid refrigerant present in the oil sump during off cycles. Additionally, the condensing unit shall have controls to initiate a refrigerant pump down cycle at system shut down on each refrigerant circuit. To be operational, the refrigerant pump down cycle requires a field-installed isolation solenoid valve on the liquid line near the evaporator. Unit Control Factory provided 115-volt control circuit includes fusing and control power transformer.  The unit is wired with magnetic contactors for compressor and condenser motors, three-leg solid-state compressor overload protection, and high/low pressure cutouts.  Charge isolation, reset relay and anti-recycle compressor timer is provided.  Across-the-line start is standard. Single Circuited, Aluminum Fin Condenser Coils for 20-30 Ton Units Condenser coils are single circuit having configured aluminum fins mechanically bonded to copper tubing with an integrated subcooler. The coils are burst tested and leak tested underwater at 450 psig (3102.8 kPa). Factory installed liquid line service valves are standard. Condenser Fans Condenser fans are direct driven with motors having thermal overload protection and permanently lubricated ball bearings. Single Refrigerant Circuit w/Two Capacity Steps for 20-30 Ton Units Each unit has a single refrigerant circuit with two (2) compressors manifolded together utilizing a passive oil system. Each unit has two capacity stages. Capacity modulation is accomplished by turning compressors on and off. Low Ambient Control Low ambient option extends unit operation from 40 F to 0 F [4.5 to -17.8 C] by utilizing an external damper assembly for head pressure control. Suction Service Valve on Packed Stock Units This unit includes a refrigerant shut off valve to isolate the compressor for servicing.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<RESPDATE>091106
<ARCHDATE>11102006
<CONTACT>Marilyn Aird, 314-331-8528
<DESC>The Government will make a sole source purchase of a Side Scan Sonar System from Marine Sonic Technology, Ltd., for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, St. Louis District.   The system will upgrade the existing survey equipment currently being used abo ard many of the Districts surveying vessels.  The Side Scan Sonar System will locate and record images of the river bottom and objects below the water surface in the Mississippi River, such as sunken vessels and buoys in navigation channels and waterways.   This system is small, light weight, self contained and environmentally protected.  It can be placed on type of floating platform for versatility. It has an internal computer system with hard drive, software that can geo-reference all images in real-time and DGPS navigation that is all internally interfaced so it can be operated off the same 12 volt power source. The imaging resolution is of a quality that a technician can accurately identify objects and or obstructions as small as 1x 1in dimension.   Th e system will integrate into existing software drivers, and allow an exchange of information and equipment between the Corpss survey crews if problems and equipment failures occur.  The St. Louis District, as well as many other districts within Corps of E ngineers, has several years experience with the present system.  Re-training personnel with a different system would be costly, in both time and money.  The Marine Sonic Centurion Side Scan is a self contained side scan unit that is powered by 12volt DC ba ttery, in a small portable environmentally protected splash proof case. This compact unit is fully enclosed in a splash proof Pelican case that measures 13x11x 6 and weights only 12 pounds. The unit has its own 300 MHz PC built into the case with a 40 g ig hard drive, proprietary software and internal display monitor. The unit has DGPS navigation built into the system for accurate location of all objects. The software allows accurate measurements of objects and are located in real time. The imaging was su perior to all units that we have seen to date. This unit can be utilized on any size vessel needed for side scan sonar investigation.  This units flexibility will be invaluable during any emergency situation including surveys that will be required for kee ping the Mississippi River navigation channel open after the emergency.  The system uniquely meets district requirements as follows:  It is Waterproof.  The system will be operated in some of the most environmentally challenging situations, including rain,  wind and ice.  The Centurion System is the only completely portable, waterproof side scan sonar system available on the market.  It is low voltage.  Due to the systems proximity to water during operations, a low power system is needed for safety of the o perators and vessel crew.  The Centurion System is the only Side Scan Sonar system that can be operated using a 12-vdc automotive battery to supply power.  It is the only system on the market that is powered entirely from the computers ISA Bus resulting i n lower power consumption.  It has a high resolution 1200kHz frequency.  Marine Sonic Technology, Ltd. is the only manufacture of side scan sonar systems that offers higher transducer frequencies of 900 and 1200kHz.   This requirement is being procured und er the Simplified Procurement Threshold.  Anticipated date of award is 11 September 2006.  Point of contact for this requirement is Marilyn Aird, Contract Specialist, by phone(314)331-8528, or by email, Marilyn.M.Aird@mvs02.usace.army.mil.

Two storm water control structures designed to slow the runoff onto adjacent property will be constructed by excavating portions of the project area and constructing earthen and rip rap berms with corrugated metal pipe for release of the control structures. These structures will be wrapped with erosion matting and seeded with native plants. Options will include the planting of native savanna trees and shrubs of varying sizes along the southern property line. The period of performance is 90 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed (NTP). The Magnitude of Construction is estimated between $25,000 to 100,000.

<DESC>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institute of Health (NIH), strives to understand, treat and ultimately sprevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives.  The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics, which are funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.  In this context, the NIAID's mission includes the development of new medical countermeasures against the biological agents that are most likely to be used in a terror attack on civilian populations.  These biological agents have been prioritized as Category A, B, and C.  Through this solicitation the NIAID is seeking to advance the development of therapeutics against selected NIAID Category A, B, and C bacterial pathogens via a focused, staged approach. Specifically the goal of this solicitation is to develop new, safe, and effective therapeutics for:

* Bacillus anthracis
* Yersinia pestis
* Francisella tularensis
* Burkholderia pseudomallei
* Burkholderia mallei
* Rickettsia prowazekii

Pathogens, excluding sexually-transmitted organisms (see http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/anti_stis.htm for list of excluded organisms), resistant to antimicrobial agents were recently added to the NIAID Biodefense Category C priority pathogens list. This solicitation will also support the development of candidate therapeutics with broad spectrum activity against NIAID Category C antimicrobial resistant bacterial pathogen(s) and at least one of the selected Category A or B bacterial pathogens (B. anthracis, Y. pestis, F. tularensis, B. pseudomallei, B. mallei and R. prowazekii). 

The candidate therapeutic should be at a stage of development that is minimally within five (5) years of completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial.  This solicitation will support non-clinical studies, medicinal chemistry, manufacturing, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, and other Investigational New Drug (IND)-, New Drug Application (NDA)-, or Biologic License Application (BLA)-enabling studies.  The NIAID is particularly interested in candidate therapeutics that have broad spectrum activity and are within the regulatory purview of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Review (CDER) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

It is anticipated that multiple cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of up to five (5) years beginning on or about June 12, 2007.  BAA NIH-NIAID-DMID-07-37 will be available electronically on or about March 31, 2006 and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (AO) Home Page by using the following electronic address and instructions:

<DESC>THE RESPONSE DATE HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM JUNE 26, 2006 TO NOVEMBER 13, 2006.  

Through this solicitation, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is seeking to establish and support several multi-disciplinary teams of biochemists and immunologists focused on the discovery of novel allergens and/or T cell epitopes that are recognized by different T cell subsets.  This solicitation will support two distinct areas of research. 

a)	Research Area 1:  Identification Validation, and Characterization of Novel Allergens – research projects to use established or innovative isolation and purification techniques to identify novel allergens from various sources.
b)	Research Area 2:  Identification and Validation of Allergen-Specific T Cell Epitopes – research projects to identify and characterize peptides containing T cell epitopes that activate allergen-specific effector T cells, and/or activate allergen-specific regulatory T cells. 

This resource reagent development initiative is an important component of the mission of the NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT), which is to promote the study of allergic diseases, define the mechanisms that underlie these diseases, and ultimately develop therapies for the treatment of these diseases.

FEEDBACK REGULATED AUTOMATIC MOLECULAR RELEASE (FRAMR) SOL BAA 06-19, Addendum 5, DUE:  12/14/06. TECHNICAL POC:  Dr. Donald J. Leo, DARPA/DSO, Ph:  (571) 218-4939, Email:  baa06-19@darpa.mil; URL: www.darpa.mil/dso. Website Submission:  http://www.sainc.com/dso0619/


DESCRIPTION

(Note: This BAA Addendum 5 is submitted as a Special Focus Area as described in the original BAA 06-19.)

As part of a larger program to mitigate pain due to battlefield trauma and improve soldier self care, DARPA seeks innovative proposals for the development of biodegradable self-regulating drug delivery systems that enable feedback-regulated release in response to biomarker(s) correlated with drug toxicity. These systems will enable new means of soldier self-care through the development of drug delivery methods that guarantee, in the combat environment, the delivery of a therapeutic dose while eliminating the possibility of harmful side effects through drug overdosage. This problem is unique to the military due to the need for effective therapeutics that can be administered quickly and safely to soldiers who may be suffering from a wide range of trauma in an uncontrolled battlefield environment.  

Proposals are requested for research projects that will develop feedback-regulated drug delivery systems that, like the released drug, are eliminated from the body by normal pathways of metabolism and excretion without toxic effects. Of greatest relevance to battlefield use are delivery systems for one or more of the classes of Food and Drug Administration-approved therapeutics (general anesthetics, local anesthetics, narcotics, or analgesics) that are currently used in tactical field care or battlefield medicine. The system might also be designed to release pharmacological or physiological antagonists in response to agonist-induced toxicities. It is also envisioned that the drug delivery systems can be administered by untrained personnel or self-administered with little regard for actual dosage, and that the route(s) of administration be suitable for conscious and unconscious patients. The duration of therapeutic effect must be at least as long as that seen with conventional formulations. 

The critical thrust of the FRAMR Program is to develop a drug release system that is modulated by one or more plasma biomarkers correlated to the toxic effect of the drug. That is, the delivery system will shut off the release of the drug when a biomarker correlated with a toxic effect of the drug is present. A complementary strategy might be to release a pharmacological or physiological antagonist to reverse toxic effects or decrease the effective agonist concentration when a biomarker correlated to toxic effect is present. 

Proposals are requested for integrated drug delivery systems that utilize feedback control. Systems that rely only on site-specific targeting, contain non-biodegradable or toxic components, or non-feedback controlled (open loop) technologies will not be considered for funding. Systems that require external energy sources to modulate release or ancillary devices to facilitate or effect administration will also not be considered.  Furthermore, this program will not support the development or improvement of therapeutics, only the development of new drug delivery systems that have relevance to tactical field care or battlefield medicine.

It is expected that each research effort will consist of an interdisciplinary team with sufficient expertise and experience to develop a feedback-regulated drug delivery system and characterize its in vitro performance. Arguments for the feasibility and performance of the proposed system should be soundly based in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles.

BACKGROUND
Drugs that ameliorate pain from surgery or trauma are widely used in battlefield medicine and tactical field care. In the hands of trained professionals, powerful analgesics such as morphine can be safely titrated to therapeutic effect while minimizing adverse drug effects. General anesthetics are also widely used, but require sophisticated expertise and equipment for safe use. On the battlefield, however, resources and equipment might be strained or unavailable, especially at the tactical level where combatants and medics are limited by what they can carry. Trained medics can administer drugs such as morphine, while in some cases non-medically trained combatants or the wounded himself must administer powerful drugs. Under these extreme conditions, careful titration of drug dosage to assure pain control is impractical if not impossible, while the risk of unintentional overdosage might be significant. For these reasons, the Department of Defense is interested in drug dosage systems that with a single dose would self-titrate to optimal therapeutic dose or maximal therapeutic effect while at the same time minimizing drug adverse events. Such systems must be suitable for conscious or unconscious patients and be simple to administer or self-administer without supplemental equipment. In addition to their immediate value at the tactical level, a self-regulating delivery system would extend and enlarge the military?s capabilities for providing safe general anesthesia for surgical procedures. 

The concept of a self-regulating drug delivery system has been limited almost exclusively to glucose-sensitive systems that regulate their release of insulin. No self-regulating system has reached the market, however, while significant resources have been devoted to ?open-loop? systems (typically liposomal or polymeric) that provide sustained drug release. While these systems are valuable and widely used, they are unable to regulate drug release in response to environmental cues. In contrast, the FRAMR Program will develop ?closed-loop? drug delivery systems that rely on feedback from biomarkers to ensure that the plasma drug concentration is within its therapeutic range. Such a system will revolutionize battlefield care.

PHASE I DURATION, GOALS, AND MILESTONES
DARPA seeks proposals for a Phase I program with a duration not exceeding twelve months. The goal of the Phase I Program is an in vitro demonstration of feedback-regulated drug delivery in response to changes in biomarkers correlated to toxic effect.  

The Phase I milestones are:

1. Demonstrate that the release rate of the drug in the drug delivery system is sufficient to achieve therapeutic levels. This demonstration must consist of an in vitro measurement of drug release. 
2. Demonstration that the release rate of the drug can be reduced by an amount sufficient to avoid toxicity (e.g. > 10:1) in the presence of a biomarker correlated to a toxic effect associated with battlefield trauma. This demonstration must consist of an in vitro measurement of drug release in the presence of physiological concentrations of biomarker correlated with toxic effect.  
3. Demonstrate that the drug delivery system is non-toxic to cell cultures. Toxicological testing should be consistent with published FDA guidance on toxicological and preclinical testing required for Investigational New Drug (IND) submission. It is not expected that all preclinical testing will be accomplished during Phase I, only that evidence is obtained to support further experimentation and advancement to Phase II.

Note that there will be no human or animal testing allowed in the Phase I program.  

PHASE II RESEARCH GOALS
Successful Phase I projects may be considered for follow-on Phase II funding to continue development of the feedback-regulated drug release system. Components of the Phase II research will include demonstration that the drug delivery system can be stored for a sufficient period of time (e.g. 3 months) and in vivo tests of the system on a small animal model.   

WHITE PAPER GUIDELINES
It is STRONGLY ENCOURAGED that a white paper be submitted to determine the acceptability of the proposed concept to the Broad Agency Announcement. The white paper should be of no more than 8 pages and should contain the following sections:

a. Definition of Battlefield Therapeutic: Define a battlefield general anesthetic, local anesthetic, narcotic, or analgesic that will be the focus of the proposed research project.
b. Concept Definition: Clearly describe the concept for feedback regulated drug delivery.  Describe the physical mechanisms that will enable regulation based on biomarkers related to toxicity associated with battlefield trauma. Identify which biomarkers will be used for feedback regulation and specify the physiological range required for feedback regulation.
c. Supporting Technical Analysis: Provide a brief analysis of the technical rationale that supports the concept for feedback regulated drug delivery.
d. Research Plan: Provide a brief research plan that describes the methods for achieving the Phase I milestones.

Description
The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).  We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 July 2007.

Anticipated Acquisition Schedule: 
Draft RFP Release                   September 06
Presolicitation Conference          September 06
RFP Release                         October 06
Contract Award                      May 07

BACKGROUND

GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon Aircraft Corporation (RAC) as the prime contractor.  RAC is currently providing GBTS CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.  The GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the maximum student and instructor training load at each training site. The GBTS has three major functional areas:  Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and the Training Integration Management System (TIMS).

There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training operations.  Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students normal and emergency procedures as defined in the Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) syllabus.  All three utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).  This includes a full functioning replica of the T-6 front seat cockpit and the same Instructor Operating Station (IOS).  Each simulator has no motion.  Each has five PC computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing system and the electronic control loading.  The primary difference in the devices is the level of corresponding visual system.  The Unit Training Device (UTD) has no visual system.  The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33 degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.  Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 or 10 Visual Control Computer and Image Generator.  Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.  The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five.

The other two ATDs are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer (EST).  The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning instruments and a moving stick and throttle.  It also has a canopy that replicates the opening forces of the A/C.  The EST is a standalone mock-up of the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection procedures.  A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been properly initiated.

The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their associated syllabi.  The T-6 Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6 Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.  The courseware was developed using Authorware.  Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate training platforms.

TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying training programs (T-6, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)  TIMS operates on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.  Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application server.  The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).     

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT

RAC is currently responsible for integration of all GBTS components.

On-Site ATD support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, and NAS Pensacola.  At the Air Force locations, the contractor provides required manning, spare parts, and support equipment to meet mission effectiveness of 95%.  There are financial penalties for not meeting the mission effectiveness.  The Government does not own ATD spares at Air Force Locations.  At the Navy location, the contractor provides manning, support equipment and replenishes Government owned spare parts.  Maintenance actions and spare parts usage are tracked using Magic Service Desk.

On-Site TIMS Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, Columbus AFB, Vance AFB and Sheppard AFB.  Each of these locations has CLS for the CAI labs and a Helpdesk (takes and responds to calls and walk-ins, enters trouble tickets, performs system administration and database administration, etc.).

Randolph AFB has one CAI lab in bldg. 740
Moody AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 709
Laughlin AFB has two CAI labs (one right above the other) in bldg. 328
Columbus AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 230 and 268
Vance AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 672
Sheppard AFB has one CAI labs in bldg. 2320

Randolph AFB is the central site for the Modification and Update Support System (MUSS) which makes changes and distributes these changes to other GBTS locations.  The MUSS supports:
ATD software and visual database maintenance
Developed courseware (i.e. CAI Graphics, Test Bank Questions, Syllabus Management)
Standardized courseware integration, quality checks, syllabus management and distribution
TIMS software maintenance (additional support provided at contractor location)
Systems and Sustaining engineering (support provided at contractor location)


FOLLOW-ON CLS CHALLENGES AND EXPECTATIONS

The required support will not include on-site ATD maintenance support for the Navy.  Excluding the Navy sites, the total support provided will be no less than the support described in the current environment above.  Support will be required to integrate T-6 and ATD production changes into the fielded GBTS.  TIMS MUSS support will require Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 certification as a minimum.  The contract type is anticipated to be fixed price with some T&M effort.

Interested sources should submit information that describes in-house capability and what might be subcontracted.  Provide experience and knowledge of:
1.     Simulator support
2.     Courseware support
3.     Training management systems and IT systems administration
4.     Software certification level
5.     Undergraduate/graduate flying training

If you have already responded to a prior sources sought announcement for this effort, updates may be submitted to address any changes contained herein.  Any comments to the documents for this effort may be addressed to the contracts representative, Ms. Lisa Adams, Lisa.Adams@wpafb.af.mil, or Ms. Michelle Hendricks, Michelle.Hendricks@wpafb.af.mil.

Information contained in this synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

The Program will use full and open competition to fulfill the CP requirement.  The CP will be delivered in accordance with specification entitled "Performance Specification Combat Pistol (PS/4081/C05/1415)” to be provided with issuance of the solicitation.  The Combat Pistol System consists of: a Caliber .45 pistol and its ancillary equipment including: Magazines (standard and high-capacity); Suppressor Attachment Kit for operation of the pistol with and without sound suppressor; Holster; Magazine Holder (standard and high-capacity); Cleaning Kit; and Operator's Manual.  The contract type will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) issuing Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) delivery orders.  The contract period of performance shall be five (5) years with an option to extend for an additional five (5) years.  The Minimum Quantity is 24/ea Engineering Test Units (ETU's).  The estimated maximum quantities are: 50,000/ea combat pistol systems (which includes a .45 caliber CP, 2 standard capacity magazines, operator’s manual and cleaning kit); 50,000/ea Holsters; 200,000/ea Standard Capacity Magazines; 360,000/ea High Capacity Magazines; 50,000/ea Magazine Holders; 15,000/ea Suppressor attachment kits; Provisioning Item Order; associated data; and 3/ea Instructor and Key Personnel (I&KP) Training courses.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center(NSWCIH), Indian Head, MD. intends to award a Sole Source Purchase Order to Thermo Electron Corporation for Bolometer Detector.  This detector will be used to monitor far-infrared signals using fourier-transform interferometric spectroscopy. The special range of interest is 700cm-1 to 50cm-1. The bolometer and optics, including a solid-substrate beamsplitter must be professionally installed. In the far-insfrared, water vapor aborption is deleterious to signal acquisition.  The detector should flush-mount to the existing Nicolet 870 FTIR spectrometer to allow for a continous nitrogen purge. Thermo Electron Corporation makes the Nicolet 870 FTIR spectrometer and reoutinely adds far-IR detection capability to this type of system. Thermo Electron Corporation is the only source of bolometer that can integrate its detector in to an exissting Nicolet 870 FTIR spectrometer that NSWC Indian Head has. No other bolometer from other sources will wor!  k properly in regards to software control, timing, gain, and detection setup. The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is 334413 with a size standard of 500 employees. The FSC code is 5865. For information regarding this synopsis, you may contact Willy B. Quiambao who can be reached at (301) 744-6789 or email willy.quiambao@navy.mil.

<DESC>This note replaces a notice that was erroneously deleted on FedBizOpps and which advises that Amendment 0002 has been posted in the Business Opportunities section of the following NAVAIR TSD website: 

http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm?client=NAWCTSD

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training System Division (NAWCTSD) has a requirement to support the Navy?s Command Aircraft Crew Training (CACT) program which includes providing all labor, equipment, training facilities, tools, training materials, training devices, supervision and other services necessary for classroom, trainer, and simulator training for Navy C-40A (Boeing 737-700C with increased gross weight (IGW) as configured for U.S. Navy) aircrew.  

The C-40A CACT program requires classroom (academic and practical) training, a Cockpit Familiarization Trainer (CFT) that depicts all cockpit systems, a Part Task Trainer (PTT) (for aircraft system training with trainee input and trainer response capability), and a FAA level "C" or higher simulator.  In lieu of the CFT or PTT a higher order device may be used.  The flight simulator must be FAA certified to Level "C" or higher under current FAA Advisory Circular 120-40 criteria for the Boeing 737-700/800 configured cockpit with freeze and repositioning capability.  The following individual pilot/crew chief training courses are required:  C-40A Pilot Initial Training and C-40A Pilot and Crew Chief Recurrent Training.  The training courses must be presented at a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 142 certified training center for the Boeing 737-700 IGW aircraft at time of training.  Instructors must be certified under Title 14 CFR Part 142.  The contractor will be required to submit training syllabus for each course for government approval.

For all courses, the contractor shall provide: All the necessary facilities, certified instructors, management personnel, scheduling/administrative personnel; materials; rights for use of materials for this contracted training, training devices, simulators; and courseware/materials needed for each course.  Pilot Initial course attendees will be designated Military Aviators.  Pilot Recurrent course attendees will be qualified Military C-40 Pilot-in-Command or Second Pilot Military Aviators that will have normally completed the C-40 Pilot Initial Course.  Pilot Recurrent training will be broken into 3 distinct tracks identified as follows:  1.) Pilot 1 Recurrent Training will be a Copilot refresher-training course; 2.) Pilot 2 Recurrent Training will be an Aircraft Commander Upgrade training course; 3.) Pilot 3 Recurrent Training will be a currently qualified Aircraft Commander recurrent training course.  Courses are stand-alone in that no contractor, pre-arrival training requirements of the trainee will be allowed.  Courses may be existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) training courses modified to meet specific requirements delineated herein.  All training courses shall be taught in compliance with the C-40 Model Manager Approved Training Syllabi.  The contractor will be required to submit a training syllabus for each course for government approval.  C-40 training will not result in a FAA check flight or certification.

AMENDMENT ONE (1)

Questions and Answers in response to the RFQ.


 
1.	RFQ Paragraph 3 Ordering Terms and Conditions:

Is the contract-type for this procurement Firm-Fixed Price or T&M? 

Answer:  Time and Materials.

2.	Statement of Work (SOW) Project Tasks:

The SOW includes descriptions of 3 phases.  Do you want us to quote a price for all three phases?

Answer:  All Three.

3.	Statement of Work ? Paragraph 3.1:

Please confirm that all software, hardware and access equipment will be acquired through another contract and will be provided GFE to the awarded contractor?

Answer:  The government intends to provide all necessary hardware and software needed by NIH users of the system.  The contractor will need to provide hardware and software needed by their own staff of developers.

4.	Statement of Work ? Paragraphs 3.1 & 3.2:

Phase I details a requirements analysis.  Phase II references implementation.  Is the contractor expected to deliver a ?Systems Design? as part of the deliverables of Phase I?

Answer:  The contractor is only expected to deliver items listed in Section 7 of the SOW.

5.	Statement of Work ? Paragraph 3.1
Please provide all relevant ?SERCH? Technical Documentation, Systems Design, description of COTS components as well as descriptions of existing and/or previously installed client software?

Answer:  SERCH documentation will not be provided because the contractor is expected to look at existing document management software in use at NIH and determine the best fit.  SERCH is only one potential solution.

6.	Statement of Work ? Paragraphs 3.1, 3.2.1 & 3.3.4

Phase I describes approximately 100 users in all.  How many of these users will be participating in the pilot systems?

Answer:  Depends on the number of volunteers from the ICs so it is impossible to determine at this point.

7.	Statement of Work ? Paragraph 3.2.1:

In order to estimate a Level of Effort (LOE), please provide the existing detailed process definition from the IC Draft to OED Submittal, Approval and Publication Phases?

Answer:  This cannot be provided since these details will be discovered by the contractor in Phase I.	

8.	Statement of Work ? Paragraph 3.2.1 & 3.3.4

Could you please confirm our assumption that our Level of Effort (LOE) should be based upon training 100 users for both pilots?

Answer:  All 100 users will require an opportunity to take training before the production system is delivered.  The pilot program will most likely involve far fewer users, however. 

9.	Statement of Work ? Paragraph 3.2.2

Please provide all of the hardware and software inventory that the government intends to utilize for this effort?

Answer:  The government intends to provide all necessary hardware and software needed by NIH users of the system.  The contractor will need to provide hardware and software needed by their own staff of developers.

10.	Statement of Work ? Paragraph 3.2.2

Please define what you refer to as ?usability issues??  Are you referring to Section 508 compliance and how do you intend to measure it?

Answer:  For this paragraph usability issues refers to any problem that prevents the ?average user? from successfully moving a document through its workflow.

11.	Statement of Work ? Paragraph 3.3.3

Is it the government?s intent to use the pilot system as its parallel test environment?

Answer:  Yes, and the government will provide hardware and software necessary to support the test environment.

12.	Statement of Work ? Paragraph 3.3.4:

Please confirm that you intend to have the contractor develop two pilot systems; one in Phase II and one in Phase III?  

Answer:  The same developed in Phase II will be further developed for Phase III.

13.  The SOW document notes that ?the recommended solution would utilize existing  document management software, especially SERCH.?

Yet, SERCH is mentioned in NIH public information as ?an integration of web-based commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products that will provide:

?	Workflow
?	Data tracking
?	Digital signatures
?	Records management
?	Document management 
?	Reports
?	Full text search.?

Q 13.1 ?  What are the COTS products currently deployed for each of the items above?

Q 13.2 ?  Are these products used by OER?

Q 13.3 ?  Will these products be expected to be utilized in the requested solution, the subject of this RFQ?

Answer:  Documentation on existing document management software will not be provided because the contractor is expected to look at evaluate available products and make a determination about whether to use them or not in Phase I.

14.   Contractor(s)

Q 14.1 ?  What information is available about contractors who have addressed the subject area of this RFQ and their scope of work the past 18 months? (i. e . their scopes of work on various projects, their current status, their involvement in this RFQ, their permission to bid on this RFQ, etc.)

Answer:  A study of high level requirements was done by Woodbourne Solutions approximately 12 moths ago.  They have not had any involvement for approximately 6 months.

Q 14.2 ?  Is eFlow currently used?  Is it intended to be the Workflow Tool for this project? If so, what is the platform for its operation?  Is eFlow intended to be replaced?  If so, by what platform?

Answer:  eFlow has not been considered thus far. 

15.   Project Monitoring and Management

Q 15.1 ?  What is the intended organization structure for this project?  Who are the Stakeholders?  What will be the intended participation by OER, IC?s, HHS in general, and NIH specifically?  

Answer:  This is covered in Section 1 of the SOW.

Q 15.2 ?  Who will manage the effort from OER?  Who are the Stakeholders? 

Answer:  A Senior Web developer will manage the effort for OER.  The stakeholders are outlined in Section 1 of the SOW.

16.  Proposal Format

Q 16.1 ?   Is it OK to include the Cost Proposal within the same document as the Technical Proposal or should it ibe a separate document?

Answer: It can be in one document.  

17.	Can you tell me If there is an incumbent on this project?

Answer:  There is not.

18.  Is there a system that is currently being used for document management, or are they currently using a paper based system?

Answer:  The stakeholders are currently emailing documents back in forth using MS Outlook and MS Word

19.  Are you looking for an off the shelf product, or would you be interested in a custom solution? Are there any technology preference?
Answer:  We are not pre judging whether a COTS solution or a custom solution is appropriate here. That is for the awardee to determine in Phase I. 
As far as which products might be used, the SOW says ?The solution should be able to run on existing hardware and software platforms and products which include ColdFusion MX, and MS SQL running on a Windows 2003 operating system.?

CORRECTION  Please submit your quote in accordance to the Statement of Work related to RFQ-OH-06-00225. Thank you, Courtney Whiting NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in  accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-06-00225.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-11.  This requirement is 100%  set-aside for small businesses. A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.  The NAICS code is 541620, and the size standard is $6.5 million.   STATEMENT OF WORK I.   Project Identification:  Consultation for Air Quality Science Assessment for Sulfer  Oxides : Statistical Issues and Analyses in Epidemiologic Studies II.  Period of Performance: September 2006-September 2008 III.  Type of Purchase Order:  Firm Fixed Price (inclusive of all travel costs and fees) IV.  Estimated Level of Effort:   157 hours for Tasks 1-8 (50 hours for Optional  Task 9-10) BACKGROUND The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  As part of this process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD)  review and integrate new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science Assessment (SA), historically known as an Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). 	The EPA is now in the process of reviewing the NAAQS for sulfur oxides (SOx).  On April 30, 1971, the EPA promulgated primary NAAQS for SO2  at 0.14 parts per million (ppm), averaged over a period of 24 hours and not to be exceeded more than once per year, and 0.030 ppm annual arithmetic mean based on the findings outlined in the original 1970 AQCD, Air Quality Criteria for Sulfur Oxides.  In 1982, EPA published the Air Quality Criteria  for Particulate Matter and Sulfur Oxides along with an addendum of newly published controlled human exposure studies, which updated the scientific criteria upon which the initial standards were based.  A second addendum presenting newly available evidence from epidemiologic and human controlled  exposure studies was published in 1986 followed by a supplement to the second addendum in 1994.  On April 26, 1988, the EPA announced its proposed decision not to revise the standards for SOx.  In that notice, the Administrator also solicited comment on an alternative of adding a 1- hour primary  standard of 0.4 ppm.  On November 15, 1994, the EPA proposed not to revise the 24 hour and annual standard but solicited comments on adding a new 5-minute standard of 0.60 ppm, with one expected exceedance. The final decision on May 22, 1996 stated that revisions of the NAAQS for SOx was not  appropriate at that time.  	The schedule for the current review of the NAAQS for SOx is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be established as a court-ordered schedule.  The EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the SOx SA by September 2008, in order to  provide the scientific basis for re-evaluation of the SOx air quality standard.  The EPA's proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for interim steps in the development of the SOx SA, including completion of the first draft of the SOx SA by June 2007. 	The scientific information on  SOx shall be reviewed and summarized in a Science Assessment Support Document (SASD) and the Science Assessment (SA).  The first draft of the SASD will be reviewed at an authors review meeting sponsored by the EPA.  This draft SASD will be revised to produce a peer review draft that shall be  reviewed by peer reviewers at a public meeting.  Peer review comments will be incorporated in the draft final SASD.  After the peer review comments are incorporated to the draft final SASD, the SA (a  focused integrative document) shall be prepared as an external review draft  for review by the  Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), and for  public comment.  The EPA anticipates preparing two drafts of the SOx SA for public and CASAC review, before completion of the final SOx SA. 	 NCEA is seeking to retain the professional services of  scientists to assist with the review, critical evaluation summary and integration of the available scientific database on SOx physical and chemical properties, measurement methods, environmental sources, concentrations, and pathways to human exposure, environmental effects, toxicological and human  effects, and an evaluation of health risks to include public health significance. 	Under this order, the EPA seeks the professional services of an expert scientist(s) to accomplish the tasks described in the statement of work, with respect to assessing human health risks from SOx  exposure. ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments 1-4, the EPA could not post the entire information to the Fed Biz Ops website.  If a contractor or consultant is interested in this requirement, please submit a request in writing via email to Courtney  Whiting at whiting.courtney@epa.gov requesting an electronic copy of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria and Attachments.

Thank you, Courtney Whiting NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in  accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-06-00228.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-11.  This requirement is 100%  set-aside for small businesses. A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.  The NAICS code is 541620, and the size standard is $6.5 million.   STATEMENT OF WORK I.   Project Identification:  Consultation for Air Quality Science Assessment for Sulfer  Oxides : Epidemiologic Studies of ER Visits & Hospitalizations II.  Period of Performance: September 2006-September 2008 III.  Type of Purchase Order:  Firm Fixed Price (inclusive of all travel costs and fees) IV.  Estimated Level of Effort:   217 hours for Tasks 1-8 (50 hours for Optional Task  9-10) BACKGROUND The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  As part of this process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) review  and integrate new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science Assessment (SA), historically known as an Air Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). 	The EPA is now in the process of reviewing the NAAQS for sulfur oxides (SOx).  On April 30, 1971, the EPA promulgated primary NAAQS for SO2 at  0.14 parts per million (ppm), averaged over a period of 24 hours and not to be exceeded more than once per year, and 0.030 ppm annual arithmetic mean based on the findings outlined in the original 1970 AQCD, Air Quality Criteria for Sulfur Oxides.  In 1982, EPA published the Air Quality Criteria  for Particulate Matter and Sulfur Oxides along with an addendum of newly published controlled human exposure studies, which updated the scientific criteria upon which the initial standards were based.  A second addendum presenting newly available evidence from epidemiologic and human controlled  exposure studies was published in 1986 followed by a supplement to the second addendum in 1994.  On April 26, 1988, the EPA announced its proposed decision not to revise the standards for SOx.  In that notice, the Administrator also solicited comment on an alternative of adding a 1- hour primary  standard of 0.4 ppm.  On November 15, 1994, the EPA proposed not to revise the 24 hour and annual standard but solicited comments on adding a new 5-minute standard of 0.60 ppm, with one expected exceedance. The final decision on May 22, 1996 stated that revisions of the NAAQS for SOx was not  appropriate at that time.  	The schedule for the current review of the NAAQS for SOx is the subject of ongoing litigation and will eventually be established as a court-ordered schedule.  The EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the SOx SA by September 2008, in order to  provide the scientific basis for re-evaluation of the SOx air quality standard.  The EPA's proposed schedule also includes a number of target dates for interim steps in the development of the SOx SA, including completion of the first draft of the SOx SA by June 2007. 	The scientific information on  SOx shall be reviewed and summarized in a Science Assessment Support Document (SASD) and the Science Assessment (SA).  The first draft of the SASD will be reviewed at an authors review meeting sponsored by the EPA.  This draft SASD will be revised to produce a peer review draft that shall be  reviewed by peer reviewers at a public meeting.  Peer review comments will be incorporated in the draft final SASD.  After the peer review comments are incorporated to the draft final SASD, the SA (a  focused integrative document) shall be prepared as an external review draft  for review by the  Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), and for  public comment.  The EPA anticipates preparing two drafts of the SOx SA for public and CASAC review, before completion of the final SOx SA. 	 NCEA is seeking to retain the professional services of  scientists to assist with the review, critical evaluation summary and integration of the available scientific database on SOx physical and chemical properties, measurement methods, environmental sources, concentrations, and pathways to human exposure, environmental effects, toxicological and human  effects, and an evaluation of health risks to include public health significance. 	Under this order, the EPA seeks the professional services of an expert scientist(s) to accomplish the tasks described in the statement of work, with respect to assessing human health risks from SOx  exposure. ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments 1-4, the EPA could not post the entire information to the Fed Biz Ops website.

<DESC>Description of Need:  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is soliciting information from industry on the existence of a non-developmental capability that provides tactical flexibility to the warfighter, in addition to the ability to hit moving targets, for use on the USN F/A-18 A+C/D/E/F, JSF and AV-8B aircraft.  NAVAIR anticipates that the solution would capitalize on existing direct attack inventories (GBU-12 Laser Guided Bomb (LGB) and/or GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM)).  Alternative solutions with affordable business cases will be considered.  The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to determine the availability of non-developmental solutions that have the potential to meet the stated objectives, to assess current industry experience and capabilities, and to support the possibility of a full and open competition to satisfy the objectives identified herein.  NAVAIR intends to use the information provided in response to this RFI to aid in refining its acquisition strategy, budgeting assumptions and performance specification.   
  
Objectives:  The Moving Target Weapon (MTW) will be capable of effectively engaging moving targets in any operational environment, day or night and in adverse weather.  The target class should include, at a minimum:  armored vehicles, mobile scuds, trucks, air defense systems, and small surface combatants.  NAVAIR intends to procure the moving target capability in FY 2008.

Although subject to change, at present, the Government envisions that the moving target weapon capability solution would include the following characteristics: 
 
a.	A design based on current GBU-12 or GBU-38 architecture;
b.	GPS/INS, INS only and laser capability; 
c.	Engagement range of 2-15 nm when released between 20-30K feet and .8-.9 Mach; 
d.	A combination of accuracy and warhead effectiveness, utilizing a MK-82/BLU-111 warhead, that will provide sufficient single-shot lethality to ensure at least a mission/mobility kill;
e.	The weapon system would be reliable, maintainable and meet all requirements for deployment on CVN and LHA/LHD class ships as well as USN/USMC land bases; 
f.	It would utilize existing weapons handling, loading and test equipment; 
g.	The system must be affordable; and
h.	The weapon system would be capable of withstanding the environmental, temperature, vibration, and shock associated with shipboard and land based F/A-18A+C/D/E/F, JSF, and AV-8B aircraft flight operations without degradation in its capability. 

RFI Content: Any written response to this RFI shall be limited to no more than 25 pages.  If the material provided contains proprietary information, please mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned).  The response should include, but not be limited to, the following: 

a) A one page company history description to include; Small Business Administration (SBA) business size classification, major products, primary customer base, and point of contacts and their telephone numbers, who are able to discuss the material submitted;
b) A description of the company?s past experience and performance of weapon systems similar to that outlined above; 
c) A description of the existing weapon system, as well as a description of the modifications that would need to be made to the GBU-12 or GBU-38 and/or aircraft in order to satisfy the objectives identified above; and 
d) Any other technical information the company deems necessary to aid the government in making an informed assessment. The technical responses should address, at a minimum, the following areas: 

1.	Weapon concept to include:  (a) performance and capabilities; (b) employment concept; (c) targeting and operational considerations; (d) pros/cons and trade space with respect to desired attributes and draft requirements; and (e) potential for growth and/or modularity. 
2.	Impact of design alternatives on aircraft integration.  
3.	Assessment of risk and technology maturity level.
4.	Tooling, test equipment, and production strategy. 
5.	Reliability, maintainability, and supportability. 
6.	Testing and verification requirements to include Modeling & Simulation capability to refine system performance and limitations.
7.	Total Life Cycle costs and considerations.

Submission Information:  It is NAVAIR's intention to review the data and may schedule separate briefings with submitters.  For planning purposes, the briefings are tentatively scheduled to be held at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, between 03 and 05 October 2006.  Final scheduling will be determined after the Government reviews the submitted RFIs.  Written responses to this RFI shall be submitted no later than 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on 18 September 2006 to: Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, Attn: Mary Brutkiewicz, Air 2.4.4.3, 47123 Buse Road, Unit #IPT, Building 2272, Suite 453, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1547, Attn: Moving Target Weapon (MTW). Electronic responses are recommended and encouraged and should be submitted to mary.brutkiewicz@navy.mil.

<DESC>Potential Sources Sought.  The Coast Guard has a requirement to purchase Rolls Royce/Bird Johnson Parts in support of various Coast Guard vessels. Technical data and/or drawings pertaining to the Rolls Royce Parts are not available within the Government and are proprietary to Rolls Royce Company.  It is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard from obtaining competition, as the Caterpillar parts are available from one souce only.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to supply the parts for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The procurement involves spare parts being procured from the prime equipment manufacuter of its actual supplier, and others proposing to manufacture the parts must either: 1) Data that the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufacturer, or 2)complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e., salient physical, functional and servieability characteristics). The submission of technical data package for review shall not impede the award of this requirements type  contract, but will qualify the proposer for follow on acquisitions of the specific part numbers offered.  It is the Government belief that only Rolls Royce Company, the manufacturer of the parts,or/or its dealers and distributors can furnish the required parts and ensure proper fit, form and function of all its components.  Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities in duplicate within 5 days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing data is required.  This is not a RFP.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  Responses must be concise and specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above.  Concerns that arespond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate a bonafide capability to meet the reqirements.  Adequate detailed data by which to evaluate capability should be sent to the attention of Patricia Johnson at the address indicated above.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The General Services Administration?s Federal Technology Service, Region 5, on behalf of the U.S. Air Force, Headquarters, Air Mobility Command (HQ AMC), is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) to identify service providers and obtain information regarding the technology, qualification and capabilities available to provide commercial television channels via satellite services.  

The HQ AMC requires commercial television activation and continued service to support internet protocol television system (IPTV) throughout the command.  The HQ AMC requires a contractor to Engineer, Furnish, Install, Test, and Place into service (EFIT&P) and maintain commercial television broadcast channels and licenses to distribute through Government IPTV equipment acquired under separate contract.  This requirement includes the need for the contractor to provide and install all necessary satellite equipment and ancillary components (i.e., receiver and front end equipment) to activate and support the delivery of up to eight (8) channels of commercial television.  The solution shall utilize Government furnished equipment to distribute signal on existing Government LAN to provide multicast television service to the base population.  Channels shall include as a minimum:  CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, Weather Channel, and two local news channels (chosen for each location from contractors listing).  The contractor shall be required to obtain and maintain requisite licenses to provide this service (re-broadcast rights) through multicast streaming video using the base network.  Services (commercial TV access/license) shall be provided to the following locations:  

-	Scott AFB, IL (4000 concurrent users)
-	Andrews AFB, MD (3000 concurrent users)
-	Charleston AFB, SC (3000 concurrent users)
-	MacDill AFB, FL (3000 concurrent users)
-	McConnell AFB, KS (3000 concurrent users)
-	Pope AFB, NC (3000 concurrent users)
-	Travis AFB, CA (3000 concurrent users)
-	McChord AFB, WA (3000 concurrent users)
-	Fairchild AFB, WA (3000 concurrent users)
-	McGuire AFB, NJ (3000 concurrent users)
-	Grand Forks AFB, ND (3000 concurrent users)
-	Dover AFB, DE (3000 concurrent users)
 
Capabilities/qualifications submitted in response to this RFI will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining the feasibility of conducting this acquisition.  Responses will be reviewed for their viability.  The determination of acquisition strategy, based upon the responses to this RFI, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All sources are encouraged to submit a response, which will be considered by the Government.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to publish any information provided by a respondent to the RFI if publishing such information is done without attribution (i.e., does not identify the party submitting the response materials), and would not reveal company trade secrets or other similar protected or proprietary information.  For example, if a respondent were to ask when the draft RFP would be released, then such a question could be published without attribution and would not jeopardize any corporate or trade secrets of the respondent.  Accordingly, the Government may publish such materials.  On the other hand, if a respondent were to provide detailed product rollout plans for a new device, then that material would not be published if properly marked.
The purpose of this RFI is to solicit comments from stakeholders regarding the acquisition approach and the extent to which industry can meet the Government?s requirements.
We invite comments/information on the following:
-	A respondent's capability to meet the requirements as drafted in the previous paragraphs.  
-	Whether the products and services are currently available on an established Government contract (i.e., GSA FSS Schedule, GWAC, etc.). 
-	Whether the products and services are currently available on the open market, or what agreements would need to be established to provide the service.
-	Estimated pricing and explanation of pricing structure(s) for services.  The Government requests pricing for a base period of one calendar year and four option years, which may be exercised based upon the Government?s continuing need, past performance and funding availability.
-	Client references of other Government Agency POC's with experience procuring similar services, or comparable commercial applications.
-	Contractor?s and/or potential subcontractors? status as a small business, veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, women-owned small business.
-	Proprietary Information.  Indicate specifically whether the response includes proprietary information, and which information should be considered proprietary.  Requirements for marking proprietary information are in FAR Subsection 3.104.  Note:  See FAR Subsection 3.104-4 for how this information will be safeguarded, if properly labeled.
-	Where stakeholders differ with the Government?s current acquisition planning, we specifically request suggested alternatives that would be equally effective in meeting the Government's objectives.
This RFI is being issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the responses to this RFI.  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government's use of such information.

Question submission requirements:	All questions regarding the RFI shall be submitted via e-mail to Wendi Borrenpohl (wendi.borrenpohl@gsa.gov) and Mara Shultz (mara.shultz@gsa.gov). 
Due date for questions to the RFI:	09/21/2006
What will be done with questions:	Questions will be reviewed and responses will be provided as appropriate via an amendment to the RFI.
Due date for responses to the RFI: 	10/10/2006

<DESC>Extension of Sources Sought Notice Reference-Number-SS06-8783825 Posted Aug 02,2006.  


Background:  Funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has been conducting research, development and demonstration (RD&D) projects to facilitate the deployment of alternative fuels into the marketplace in order to achieve three objectives: 1) enhance the reduction of mobile source emissions in California and the United States; 2) increase US competitiveness and economic prosperity; and 3) preserve the environment through the reduction of emissions and toxins from the motor vehicle population. NREL and the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) are collaborating on a joint RD&D project to demonstrate the benefits of the unique properties of Fischer-Tropsch diesel fuel and to substantially reduce the emissions from engines used in on-road transportation refrigeration applications. This project supports SCAQMDs mandate under the Lewis-Presley Air Quality Management Act to establish a program to encourage participation in projects to increase the utilization of clean-burning fuels.


Additionally, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) recently passed legislation regulating the particulate matter (PM) emissions from transport refrigeration units (TRUs). The PM emission contribution from TRUs is estimated at 2.6% of the total diesel PM emission. Emissions from TRUs are expected to increase in future years. To address these emissions, the CARB is requiring TRUs to meet specific performance standards based on unit horsepower. A TRU can meet the regulation with a variety of techniques including engine exhaust aftertreatment and/or fuel substitution.


Accordingly, NREL, SCAQMD, and CARB are exploring strategies to mitigate PM emissions from TRUs. One strategy is to employ gas-to-liquid (GTL) fuel in place of conventional diesel fuel. In on-road engines, GTL fuel has been shown to reduce PM emissions without accompanying increases in other regulated emissions (Alleman and McCormick, SAE 2003-01-0763). The near-zero sulfur content of GTL fuel can also enable exhaust aftertreatment and may allow this equipment to operate at higher efficiencies.


Project Description and Fuel Requirement:  NREL is leading a project to evaluate, quantify, and compare emissions from TRU diesel engines fueled with: (1) GTL fuel and equipped with a particulate filter, and (2) CARB specification diesel fuel.  NREL intends to select up to twelve TRU-equipped vehicles from a host fleet in the South Coast Air Basin for evaluation. Six of the TRUs will be powered by GTL-fueled engines and retrofitted with particulate filters.  The remaining six TRUs will be operated exclusively with CARB specification conventional diesel serving as control groups.  The catalyst system will then be installed at the exhaust of six TRU engines. One of the TRU engines will be tested over steady-state test procedures on an engine dynamometer while the engine is independently powered by GTL fuel, with and without the DPF and CARB diesel fuel.  The TRU-equipped vehicles will then be demonstrated in service for six to twelve months to evaluate performance, reliability, and emission-reduction potential of GTL fuel and a particulate filter system. The same TRU engine will be tested again at the end of the project.


Fuel Provider Requirements:  To support the fuel requirements of the above-described project, NREL is seeking organizations that can supply GTL diesel fuel and technical liaison services under the conditions described below.  Organizations responding to this Notice will demonstrate their ability to meet these requirements:

<SUBJECT>2006 NNFE and Industry Conference
<DESC>The theme for this yearâ€™s 11th annual Naval NETWAR FORCEnet Enterprise and Industry Conference, formerly known as the SPAWAR Industry Conference, is Evolving the Network:  Meeting the Warfighterâ€™s Critical Information Needs. For a second consecutive year, the Program Executive Office for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (PEO C4I) and the Naval Network Warfare Command (NETWARCOM) will join SPAWAR and NDIA, San Diego Chapter, in presenting the conference. Senior officials from these commands are invited to share their perspective on how the Navy Enterprise Triad will clearly define the roles and responsibilities of each in order to collectively enhance the delivery of network centric operations to the fleet and the Joint Warfighter.  The conference has grown in importance and scope to become the major West Coast symposium for discussing joint C4I issues facing the warfighter.  Invited speakers include Congressman Duncan Hunter; Vice Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Robert Willard, USN; Commander Third Fleet, Vice Admiral Barry Costello, USN; Commander Second Fleet, Vice Admiral Mark Fitzgerald; Commander Naval Air Forces, Vice Admiral James Zortman, USN; Program Executive Officer (Acting), Mr. Chris Miller, PEO C4I. Navy acquisition has reached a new era with the development and implementation of an Enterprise approach. The Naval NETWAR  FORCEnet Enteprise (NNFE) is a collaborative effort that includes Commander of NETWARCOM as the requirements lead, OPNAV (N6F) as the resource sponsor and TEAM SPAWAR  (including PEO C4I, PEO Space Systems and PEO Enterprise Information Systems) as the provider of capability.  The conference concludes with a banquet Nov. 16 with the sixth annual Fleet Support Awards.  The banquet will include a keynote speaker. The Naval NETWAR FORCEnet Enterprise and Industry Conference will provide a forum for discussion of acquisition strategies and upcoming business opportunities for both large and small businesses. This conference will continue to provide opportunities for networking with government officials and a broad spectrum of industry representatives: http://www.ndia-sd.org/2005-conference/index.html

<SUBJECT>58 -- CellXion Networks GX200
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
 
I.  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY  Department of the Air Force, 375 Contracting Squadron, 375 CON/LGCB, 201 E Winters St, Building 50, Scott AFB IL 62225-5015.  HQ AFCA, 203 W Losey St, Scott AFB IL 62225-5233.
 
II.  DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION  A justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the acquisition of the CellXion Networks GX200 Series Global System for Mobile (GSM) with the following options:  base identity/firewall mode, 1900 MHz BTS covert call, voice intercept/delivery, SMS intercept/delivery, and training.  The source is Lociva, 15330 Riding Club Dr, Haymarket, VA 20169.  This system is being procured for evaluation to ensure it meets secure voice requirements on DoD Senior Leadership Aircraft.  Current secure voice systems aboard the aircraft fleet do not meet reliability standards required by mission objectives.
 
III.  DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES  AFCA requires dedicated support from Lociva to accomplish complete testing and evaluation of this complex new technology.  Tasks to be performed include training, system installation and integration with existing aircraft communications systems.  Deliverables to be provided include system, installation and training. This acquisition has an estimated value of $248,400.00.  This acquisition will ensure DoD commanders can meet secure voice requirements to maintain Command and Control during extended flights.
 
IV.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY  "10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(l), Only One Responsible Source."
 
V.  APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY  Lociva is the only authorized reseller for Cellxion products that integrates the Cellxion components with other equipment to create stand-alone systems.  This integration of the features of large GSM cellular systems into a small reliable package, that meet size and capability constraints required for use on a wide variety of aircraft, is the only requirement that will meet the government?s needs.   As Lociva systems, worth $160,000.00, have been purchased in the past, the procurement of separate pieces of equipment by other sources would significantly reduce system progression due to a lengthy learning curve, duplication in effort, and delays in program completion, due to lack of familiarity integrated Portable GSM system configurations and operations.  We must have Lociva?s expertise to fully ensure the complete interoperability of the system with existing systems. 
 
VI.  EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION  In accordance with FAR Part 5, a sole-source notice will be posted to FedBizOpps and all interested sources offering alternative products will be considered. 
 
VII.  FAIR AND REASONABLE COSTS  The Contracting Officer will determine that the anticipated price will be fair and reasonable based on accomplishing a comparison of Lociva?s proposal with their published commercial pricing lists, previous orders, and similar products.  
 
VIII.  MARKET RESEARCH  Market research was conducted utilizing GSA Advantage and the internet.  No companies were identified that are able to supply the Government?s requirement.   Cellxion, the equipment manufacturer has confirmed Lociva is an authorized reseller of their products.  

IX.  OTHER FACTS  Previous Lociva orders FA4407-05-P-0103 and 0120 were awarded sole-source, as no other sources were identified.  As Lociva integrated equipment and software is currently used on other test beds, Lociva is the only viable solution.  Additionally, one contractor must formulate all program needs, in order to ensure complete interoperability and integration requirements.  Secure voice communications are vital to current counter-terrorism efforts.  
 
X.  INTEREST SOURCES  None.
 
XI.  STEPS TO FOSTER COMPETITION  Future follow-on acquisitions for further enhancements that are developed based on the previous phases will continue to be available only from Lociva for the same reasons cited in this justification.
 
XII.  CONTRACTING OFFICER?S CERTIFICATION  I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

XIII.  TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL CERTIFICATION  I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

1.    The 542d Combat Sustainment Wing, in cooperation with HQ AFMC/A4BW,is sponsoring a class for personnel from defense contractors who perform reapir work for the Air Force.   Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) conducts LOG 132 for Air Logistic Centers (ALC) employees to instruct them in the repair business.  One week of that class is spent at a contractor?s facility learning about repairs from their perspective.  Our class is the reciprocal course.  We invite you to participate in our LOG 132 For Contractors from 24 to 26 October 2006. --

2.  This class is designed to help contractors understand the process that the ALC goes through in order to obtain a repair contract.  Material we concentrate on include preparing budgets for future workloads, managing performance based contracts, managing assets, and determining what work stays organic and what goes out on Contract.  According to the feedback we received from our earlier classes, those who will benefit the most are program managers, contract administrators, order administrators, and business development people.  -- 

3.  We believe this course will benefit your company greatly.  We also hope you will see the vision we have of cross training our respective repair administrators so that we can work more smoothly in the future.  If this sounds like something you are interested in, please CONTACT BILL SIRMON at 478-926-5625 or bill.sirmon@robins.af.mil on or before 10 Oct 2006. --

<DESC>SUBJECT:  LOG 132 For Contractors --
  
1.    The 542d Combat Sustainment Wing, in cooperation with HQ AFMC/A4BW, is sponsoring a class for personnel from defense contractors who perform repair work for the Air Force.   Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) conducts LOG 132 for Air Logistic Centers (ALC) employees to instruct them in the repair business.  One week of that class is spent at a contractor's facility learning about repairs from their perspective.  Our class is the reciprocal course.  We invite you to participate in our LOG 132 For Contractors from 24 to 26 October 2006. --

2.  This class is designed to help contractors understand the process that the ALC goes through in order to obtain a repair contract.  Material we concentrate on include preparing budgets for future workloads, managing performance based contracts, managing assets, and determining what work stays organic and what goes out on Contract.  According to the feedback we received from our earlier classes, those who will benefit the most are program managers, contract administrators, order administrators, and business development people.  --

3.  We believe this course will benefit your company greatly.  We also hope you will see the vision we have of cross training our respective repair administrators so that we can work more smoothly in the future.  If this sounds like something you are interested in, please CONTACT BILL SIRMON at 478-926-5625 or bill.sirmon@robins.af.mil on or before 10 Oct 2006. --

<SUBJECT>--Notice of Intent to negotiate a sole source contract.
<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with STARLIMS Corporation, 4000 Hollywood BLVD, Suite 515 South, Hollywood, FL 33021-6755.  The procurement will provide the Department of Homel and Security's National Bioforensic Analysis Center (NBFAC) with a mission critical laboratory information management system (LIMS).   In order to fulfill the NBFAC mission in bioforensic identification, NBFAC requires a LIMS that will track sample processing for multiple testing tracks, efficient processing of batches of samples (96 well plate), management and documentation of controls, critical reagents and equipment, as well as integration with testing instruments and reporting of test results. Management and monitoring of samples processing and testing will be a key factor to successfully tracking many cases with differing sample analy sis plans being processed at multiple sites. Further, NBFAC requires a system that will not only accurately track sample quantities and storage locations, it also needs to conduct data comparisons for expedient identifications.  Additionally, the LIMS will  need to integrate with the existing NBACC network (predominantly Microsoft windows environment), barcode system, dynamic reporting system, digital imaging system, Quality Management System, and several laboratory instruments.  NBFAC has performed a survey  of the market and determined that the only LIMS capable of meeting its criteria is the STARLIMS application. Any company that believes that it can meet these requirements is invited to submit written notification to the Contract Specialist within 15 calendar days from the date of the publication of this notice.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient  detail to demonstrate the company's ability to meet the requirement.  Information may be sent by email to the Contract Specialist at: Mary.Rico@amedd.army.mil.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  However, responses received fr om responsible businesses prior to close of business on 21 September 2006 will be evaluated.  If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source order.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS FOB DESTINATION CONUS FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, Maintenance Branch of the LAN/WAN services Division, IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/MNT.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Microsoft, Acrobat and Lotus software licenses.  These software packages are already used by the Department of State.  Thousands of mission critical files were created using these programs, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/MNT has identified the Microsoft Project and Visio, Adobe Acrobat and Lotus Notes Collaboration CD media and licenses as key components of the Department’s working force.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP DDR kits.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, Department of State infrastructure commonality, as well as IRM/EOC’s operational requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.IRM/OPS/SIO/ESOC has identified that the HP DDR kits are an integral component of EOC’s GSX Virtual Server Infrastructure. The equipment listed above is required to provide hardware upgrades to an existing backup/restoration and disaster recovery infrastructure within the ESOC’s Virtual server architecture. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  But since the requested hardware will be used to provide upgrades to our current infrastructure it is not only industry standard to upgrade using parts from the current vendor but intermixing hardware could possibly void our current warranty on the primary equipment.  Also, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the defined requirements as a key component of IRM/OPS/SIO/EOC’s Server infrastructure Disaster recover and backup solution.

SCHEDULE OF ITEMS:     
ITEM #0001-Crafco Supershot 125 Diesel Melter Applicator	 $________________
Price should include delivery costs.

AGAR 411.170  Brand name or equal.
(a) Since this solicitation is for a Brand Name or Equal the following information is provided:
(i)  Melter/Applicator, diesel powered, to do repair cracks in roads.
(ii) CRAFCO SUPERSHOT 125 Diesel Melter/Applicator with 2 one-half inch pintle hitch, 28? hitch extension, 7 pin light plug, strobe light kit, overnight heater, fire extinguisher mounted, spare tire kit, engine cover, engine gauge kit  
(iii) Manufacturer:  Crafco Inc, an Ergon Company, 420 Roosevelt Avenue, Chandler, AZ  85226  http://www.crafco.com 800-276-0406
(iv) Required Salient Characteristics 
Size:	Not to exceed 125 gallon capacity.  Any larger and the machine would be too large for the road conditions of the forest.
Pump System:  On demand pump system that only allows the material to flow when the trigger is pulled, eliminating line pressure, therefore making it impossible for the line to burst.
Material Pump:  Located inside the material tank, thereby eliminating material re-circulation, external pumping and high pressure lines.  The internal pump also does not require pump packings that leak and eliminates pump maintenance.
Safety:  Has a lid safety switch which stops the agitator when the loading door is opened and a low flow profile angled opening, eliminating splash back on the operator.  The double safety thermostat eliminates overheating of the oil and crack sealing material.
Interlock Hydraulic:  This systems allows the unit to automatically begin agitating and heating the hose at the appropriate time, which reduces the chance of damage to the machine by the operator.
Hose Heating System:  Has a low voltage 700 watt heated hose heating element controlled by a thermostat system which eliminates material building up in the hose.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/Screening Information Request (SIR) for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Office of Safety, Health and Environment (OSHE).  TSA hereby makes aware all interested parties that it is soliciting technical proposals under a SIR to fulfill its Voluntarily Abandoned Property (VAP) requirement.  This is a full and open SIR and all interested companies are invited to participate regardless of business size.  Any and all updates to this synopsis/SIR will be posted to the Government Point of Entry at www.fbo.gov.  Interested parties are encouraged to check www.fbo.gov frequently for possible updates.  While any and all questions must be directed to one of the Government points of contact identified in this synopsis/SIR, answers to those questions, as well as any and all clarifications, extensions or changes will be posted to www.fbo.gov and will only be available at www.fbo.gov prior to the closing date and time of the SIR.

This procurement will be conducted using the Transportation Security Administration Acquisition Management System (TSAAMS).  Interested parties may learn more about the Acquisition Management System at http://fast.faa.gov.  TSA is exempted from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA – Public Law 107-71) and empowered to use TSAAMS by the same authority.  TSA will conduct this solicitation using the following steps:  

Interested firms may contact TSA for a copy of its Screening Information Request (SIR), including evaluation factors, instructions, list of TSA Federalized Locations, Non-Disclosure Agreement and Statement of Work.  Firms may then submit a technical proposal in response to this SIR.  TSA will evaluate these technical proposals strictly in accordance with those evaluation factors as published in the SIR instructions.  Based on this evaluation, TSA will establish a competitive range consisting of those firms who, based on their technical proposal, are most likely to receive award.  Those firms who are not included in the competitive range will be notified and will have 3 business days to request a debriefing with the Contracting Officer (CO).  Those firms who are included in the competitive range will receive a request for offer that includes an invitation to submit a price proposal for their technical approach as well as be invited to participate in oral presentations.  The subject of these presentations is clearly stated in the SIR.  TSA will then conduct a best value analysis by comparing the proposed price to the proposed technical approach for each firm included within the competitive range.  TSA envisions a single award as the end result of this screening process to a company whose proposed technical solution and price (inclusive of the base and all 4 option years) represents the best value to the agency.  However, TSA makes no guarantee of award of contract as a result of this or any future SIR.        

Background

Prior to passage of ATSA, the air carriers were responsible for the screening of commercial air carrier passengers.  They also were responsible for the collection and disposition of all prohibited items, including hazardous materials.  With the passage of ATSA, TSA became responsible for the screening of these passengers.  49 U.S.C. §44901(a).  

As a result, TSA determined that it had the legal responsibility to accept prohibited and hazardous items voluntarily abandoned by passengers at security checkpoints.  Having accepted the property, TSA is legally liable for the disposition of abandoned or forfeited personal property.  Hazardous materials, if not otherwise donated per 41 CFR 101-42.304, must be disposed of in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations.  42 U.S.C. §6901 et seq.

In 2003, TSA issued the National Voluntarily Abandoned Property and Hazardous Material Disposal Contract to assist with the management, disposition and disposal of the prohibited and hazardous items voluntarily abandoned by passengers at security checkpoints.  In April 2005, TSA added lighters to the prohibited item list as directed by Congress in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004.  Since adding lighters to the prohibited items list, the amount of hazardous material abandoned at TSA screening checkpoint has nearly quadrupled.  

TSA did not anticipate the volume of lighters being abandoned at the checkpoint to remain at such a high level.  

TSA hereby makes all interested parties aware that the incumbent Contractor for this effort is Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).  While a contract for VAP was awarded previously, the requirement has changed substantially from its original inception and this procurement far exceeds the scope of the original requirement.  

Industry Day

TSA will conduct an Industry Day at TSA Headquarters in Arlington, VA on May 23, 2006 at 2:00pm.  TSA Headquarters is located at 601 South 12th St in Arlington VA, directly across from the Fashion Center at Pentagon City.  All interested parties are invited to attend.  Please note that attendance at Industry Day is not mandatory for responding to the SIR but it is highly encouraged.  If you plan to attend, you must alert the TSA point of contact listed herein as soon as possible.  Interested parties must attend Industry Day in person and each firm is limited to two (2) attendees.  No phone number will be provided for call-in participation.  Interested parties are advised of the following security procedures at TSA:

Please arrive at least 20 minutes prior to the start of the event to 601 South 12th St.  Street parking is extremely limited and garage parking runs anywhere from $2-$4 per hour so Metro is highly encouraged.  Proceed to the Visitor’s Center at 601 South 12 St to check in.  TSA Security will log in all visitors and issue temporary badges.  This process can cause delays so interested parties are encouraged to arrive early.  Visitors will be escorted to the meeting room by a member of TSA’s staff.  Visitors are cautioned that they must be escorted at all times by a member of TSA’s staff while in TSA spaces.  Failure to abide by TSA’s visitor procedures may result in expulsion from TSA spaces.  

Tentative Milestones:

TSA’s tentative milestones (which the Agency reserves the right to change) for this procurement are as follows:

May 19, 2006 – SIR Available to interested parties
May 23, 2006 – Industry Day held at TSA HQ
June 9, 2006 – Last day to request SIR package

This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-06-1041 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 339111 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to procure a Bioacore? T100 Processing Unit from Biacore Inc, 200 Centennial Ave., Ste 100, Piscataway, NJ 08854. The section on Natural Products Chemistry, LBC, NIDDK carries out research whose aim is to develop inhibitors that will block infection by HIV and the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  In addition to biological assays that measure effects on pathogens, an equally powerful approach to evaluate small molecule and protein inhibitors involves measuring the strength of binding, and the rates at which these interactions occur.  The only technique that can provide these highly valuable measurements on microgram quantities of material is known as surface plasmon resonance (SPR).  

The following specifications shall be included in the system:

1)  The lab will be routinely measuring binding constants on solutions ranging from picomolar to millimolar concentrations and Kds, the instrument shall perform at these extremes, as well as in the middle, with equal accuracy and sensitivity.
2) The lab will be immobilizing both small molecules and proteins onto the surface chips through a variety of different methods, including covalent modifications and affinity interactions, the instrument must be compatible with these different surface chemistries.  In addition, because of the immobilizing antibodies, proteins, membranes and receptors, the chemistry of the chip must be compatible with such macromolecules.  Dextran-based surfaces have been proven to work well for these needs.
3) The chips used for immobilization must have a proven track record of being reusable.  This is critical because the reagents being used are extremely expensive and cannot be replaced.
4) The T100 instrument will be an upgrade/rebuild of an older Biacore 3000 system.  

Biacore? T100 Processing Unit: 
Includes System Operation Kit, Support Documentation, Software and accessories

Biacore T100 System Accessories:
Includes Sensor chip package, reagent package, Vial and cap package, getting started Kit and Maintenance Kit

Biacore Computer System including CPU, monitor and printer

Biacore T100 New User Training Course (1 user):
Includes hotel and travel stipend.  Training and travel stipend valid for 12 months from date of installation.

Biacore T100 Warranty:
Priority Service response time; insurance coverage against any unexpected breakdown; One (1) Preventive Maintenance Visit (excludes Preventative Maintenance Kit); Priority technical support vial email, telephone, and internet; priority assistance with assay development, data analysis and troubleshooting, including one (1) on-site visit per year; One (1), one day, on-site Biacore Fundamentals training course or Biacore Applications seminar.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is # OVP-S-06-0001 and is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular #2005-12 effective August 4, 2006.  The NAICS code is 519190.  The contract will be firm, fixed-price for a base period of one year and four (4) one-year option periods.  The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns.


STATEMENT OF WORK
The contractor will provide a news summary/briefing focused on the Office of the Vice President News Clips (OVPNC). The service will be for the internal use of employees of the executive Office of the President, Office of the Vice President.  No outside distribution will be allowed.  Services are required seven days a week, to be delivered by email.  The contractor will monitor print and broadcast news for mention of the Office of the Vice President (OVP).  The monitoring will be done using professional news editors/analysts.  Contractor will utilize several news-aggregation tools, including proprietary systems if available, and overlapping services.  It is important that the contractor sensibly filters the vast amount of information available each day in the most efficient way, and to appropriately monitor the news so that all important references are included.  The best practices used to monitor the news will be determined by the contractor.


Sources for News Summaries:  The summaries shall focus on news from (1) Newspapers: The Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Times, USA Today, Los Angeles Times, Detroit News, New York Post, Baltimore Sun, Miami Herald, Chicago Tribune, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Atlanta Constitution-Journal, the Boston Globe; (2) Newswires: AP, Reuters, Bloomberg, Dow Jones, UPI; (3) Television: national news from ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, CNN, MSNBC, FOXNEWS; and (4) Weekly news publications: Newsweek, TIME, and U.S. News & World Report.  The contractor must also monitor the nation's remaining media, including most regional and local newspapers, local TV news, Internet news, relevant specialty press, and some overseas press, for unique or breaking stories.  


Format for News Summaries:  The documents for OVPNC must be written in a manner that informs staff completely without forcing them to read redundant or irrelevant information such as would be found in the original full-text stories.  To accomplish this, the contractor will 1) use its expertise regarding the White House and OVP to find potentially relevant stories from the sources described above, and will use both keyword search and manual-search methodologies to ensure completeness; (2) Review the stories and apply an understanding of policy and other news topics that related to the missions of the OVP; (3) Determine which aspects of each story, if any, are important for the respective briefings; (4) Organize this relevant material by topic; and (5) weave that information into new, concise, multi-source stories or, where appropriate, condensed single-source summaries.  Each briefing must: (6) be prepared using experienced analytical abilities; (7) include an interactive cover index organized by subject matter; (8) include hypertext links in each write-up to the original media source when available, and (9) be available for redistribution to approximately 110 OVP employees.


Other news requirements:  (1) Print news shall be presented in full-text form.  (2) Television News: shall be just those portions of the transcript that relate to the Vice President.  The successful vendor?s editors shall make judgments about each article or broadcast to determine if the mention of the Vice President should be included in the media-monitoring package.  News that merely mentions the Vice President in passing would not typically be included.  Stories with substantive information would be included.  (3) Special Schedules:  When the Vice President is on travel/ outside the metro Washington, D.C. area, the contractor shall focus coverage of local television on broadcast markets in the travel areas.


Delivery:  The contractor shall deliver the print and broadcast news service 7 days per week and by 6:45 a.m. via email to a designated Executive Office of the President employee.  All of the above tasks must be performed fast enough to ensure OVP has the most current news, including that from that morning's newspapers and TV broadcasts from the previous 24 hours.   The contractor's editorial operations must also be extremely flexible because the OVP may  require, on short notice, that additional versions of the briefing be prepared and that those versions be delivered on deadlines as early as 1:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time when, for example, the Vice President travels overseas/outside the continental United States.  


PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS:  Proposals shall consist of the following: (1 ) A technical capabilities statement limited to 5 pages which describes the offeror's capability to meet the requirements stated above. (2) A sample news summary and clips package with suggested news categories/content headings.  To demonstrate this capability, offeror must provide access to a web-site which includes electronic samples of the briefing and clips, no later than 6:45 a.m. for a period of 5 days.  The Government will advise the offeror when the test web site will be used.  (3) Past performance references to include contact name, phone number and description of services provided.  Reference descriptions shall be limited to 1 page each. (4) Firm fixed monthly price to include all services described above for services beginning October 1, 2006.  Include pricing for the base year and each option year.


EVALUATION:  Evaluation shall be made on the best value, considering technical capabilities, sample news summary, references, and price.

<DESC>ACC A6 requests the purchase of Password Policy Enforcer v4.x 500,000 user Perpetual License and Password Policy Enforcer Premium Support Plan to upgrade existing, in-place ANIXIS software. Password Policy Enforcer is an advanced password filter for Windows. Password Policy Enforcer helps secure the network by ensuring users choose strong passwords IAW with the National Security Agency. When a user chooses a password that does not comply with the password policy, PPE immediately rejects the password and explains to the user why their password was rejected. Unlike password cracking products that check passwords after they are accepted by the operating system, PPE checks new passwords immediately to ensure that non-secure passwords do not jeopardize network security. You can also use PPE to ensure that passwords are compatible with other systems, and to synchronize passwords with other networks and applications. HQ ACC CONS, Langley AFB, VA intends to negotiate a non-competitive, sole source, commercial purchase order with ANIXIS for the above software upgrades and support plan. ANIXIS is currently the sole source of the Password Policy Enforcer for their software. The Government's intention to solicit and negotiate with only one source is authorized IAW FAR 6.302-1. The procurement is authorized IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1). A Sole Source Justification and Approval document For Other Than Full and Open Competition is attached to this solicitation. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement via email to robert.heiden@langley.af.mil before COB 12 Sept 2006.

<DESC>The 12th Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB intends to award a contract for the purchase of 20 Hobart Model GPU-400 rectifiers. This is a Brand Name Requirement in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1(c) Application for brand name descriptions . The Brand Name Justification is as follows:  Purchasing Hobart rectifiers eliminates the need to purchase additional parts, hardware or special test equipment since this is the type of rectifier used on Randolph AFB.

<DESC>This is a combined solicitation synopsis.  No other solicitation is available.  The USDA, National Finance Center, New Orleans Louisiana has a requirement for 30(thirty) rooms  in the Alexandria, Louisiana area in accordance with the requirements stated below:
This award will be made utilizing the simplified acquisition procedure under FAR Part 13, Far Part 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; Far Part 52.212-4. Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; Far part 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions required to implement Status or Executive Orders-Commercial Items; and FAR Part 52.232-33, Payment by electronic fund transfer apply.  Vendor must have registered in the Central Contractor Registration Database at www.ccr.gov to receive this award..  Quotes must include price and a list of services offered including a brochure.

Requirements:

The United States Dept. Of Agriculture, National Finance Center is seeking to enter into an agreement with a Hotel/Motel within a 45 mile driving distance of 3727 Government Street, Alexandria, Louisiana in accordance with the following requirements:

1.0 INTRODUCTION

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Finance Center (NFC), is procuring hotel rooms for NFC Command Center employees in the event of disaster that impacts the New Orleans area.  The NFC Statement of Work will assure consistent performance and be result-orientated.  The selected contractor will provide hotel room accommodations in accordance with all terms and conditions set forth in the contract.  

2.0 BACKGROUND

Although this need applies to all potential disasters, it is anticipated that the primary reason for utilizing hotel rooms will be a hurricane-related.  Hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30.  In the event of the possibility of a hurricane impacting the New Orleans area, the NFC, which is a 24x7 operations command center, will require housing in a safe location that is away from the current hurricane and potential hurricane hazards and dangers.  At least 96 hours prior to landfall of a hurricane, an advance team will be deployed to this area to set up the NFC Command Center.  At 48 hours prior to landfall, a decision will be made whether or not to expand the operation, with the possibility of additional personnel arriving.  If a storm similar to Hurricane Katrina impacts the New Orleans area, it will require that NFC remain in the safe location for an undetermined amount of time, due to the inability to return to normal operations in the New Orleans area.  

3.0 SCOPE

3.1	Period of Performance
The contract period of performance is for one year with four one-year option periods.  The services will be required on an as-needed basis.  The base and option periods are as follows:

Base Year		September 25, 2006 through May 31, 2007
Option Year 1:		June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2008
Option Year 2:		June 1, 2008 through May 31, 2009
Option Year 3:		June 1, 2009 through May 31, 2010	
Option Year 4:		June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2011

3.2 Quantities
The NFC anticipates the need for 30 hotel rooms and 30 parking spaces.  These numbers may increase or decrease slightly depending on NFC?s needs.  

The total contract minimum guarantee is $5,000.  If the NFC does not occupy hotel rooms during the life of the contract, the minimum guarantee of $5,000 will be paid to the contractor.  If, during the life of the contract, the NFC occupies the contractor?s hotel rooms, the amount paid to the contractor for those rooms will be applied toward the $5,000 minimum guarantee.  The contract will remain in place until May 31, 2011, if the Government decides to exercise the option periods.

Bush signed an Executive Order, expanding the 1996 Charitable Choice Legislation enacted under President Clinton?s Administration.  In FY 04, President Bush introduced the Access to Recovery Program (ATR) Grant, a SAMHSA treatment and recovery support initiative, offering those affected by the substance abuse opportunity to choose treatment and recovery services among community and faith based clinical treatment and recovery support service providers.

In FY 06, SAMHSA desires to continue it work with community and faith based organizations including ATR service provider organizations by providing capacity building and sustainability technical assistance and training to these groups.  I addition, SAMHSA desires to procure contractual services with organizations having specific expertise in providing technical assistance and training to grassroots faith and community organizations including ATR treatment and recovery provider organizations.

STATEMENT OF WORK
Upgrade to Nortel PBX
AS OF August 9, 2006


1.0 BACKGROUND:  The mission of the Defense Finance & Accounting Services Rome is to produce timely and accurate disbursements to the Department of Defense personnel, their dependants and commercial concerns. Automation support varies with in each directorate at all DFAS sites, but every function depends heavily upon telecommunications services to respond to customer needs.  DFAS needs to provide better customer service while reducing costs by upgrading the Nortel 61C Public Branch Exchange (PBX) at Rome.  Currently telephony support is provided by the Air Force Research Lab, Rome Research Site (AFRL). The Rome Labs Director has determined that they no longer desire to support DFAS Rome.  This means that DFAS Rome requires its own PBX for telephony support. 
 
2.0 SCOPE:  The Nortel PBX at DFAS Rome requires an upgrade in order to meet Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) requirements.  DFAS Rome currently has a population of 564 personnel.  Rome?s population will increase by 436 more personnel due to BRAC realignment.  The Nortel 61C PBX is currently not a fully functional PBX. The current DFAS PBX is a fiber remote off of the AFRL PBX.  The Nortel 61C PBX was shipped from San Bernardino to DAFS Rome.  The contractor will provide equipment, software, and such technical support and training needed to install and implement the upgrade of the DFAS San Bernardino Nortel PBX to version 4.5 with Call Pilot, Symposium Express, DSN, and IP trunking.  The contractor will upgrade the frame relay room to required specifications needed to support the total population of DFAS Rome.  The battery backup and rectifier will need to be replaced.  All equipment and installation shall meet applicable local codes for electrical and personnel safety ratings. All equipment must meet JTIC certifications. The contractor shall provide the necessary interfaces (cabling and wiring) for the PBX.  

3.0 OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this statement of work (SOW) is for the contractor to engineer, install, program, and test the upgrade of the Nortel 61C PBX that was shipped from San Bernardino to version 4.5 or greater with Call Pilot, Symposium Express, DSN, and IP trunking and connect it to the existing PBX stack.  Replace existing backup batteries and move the rectifier.

4.0 TASKS: The contractor will provide on-site technical support during the PBX upgrade to include the following:
 
4.1 Rebuild the PBX that was shipped from San Bernardino to operational status and upgrade to Ver 4.5.

4.2 Connect San Bernardino PBX to the Rome PBX.

4.3 Install Call Pilot.

4.4 Install DSN.

4.5 Symposium Express with 10 licenses.

4.6 Provide 3 year Software Release Subscription (SRS).

4.7 Training for administration/development for 2 personnel.

4.8 The contractor will ensure that the proper blocking is used between the PBX and framework.

4.9 Wiring and cabling installation between switch and frame room must be properly secured using available cable trays. 

4.10 Install new backup batteries in the North West corner of room W110.

4.11 Relocate the rectifier to the North West corner of room W110.

5.0 PBX Requirements Room W110

5.0.1 Caller ID for digital phones with PRI T-1 trunking.

5.0.2 The upgrade will include IP networking using a signaling server and OTM with appropriate licensing. DFAS will supply the computer.

5.0.3 Warrantee maintenance will be done during normal business hours unless an emergency is determined.

5.0.4 Remote management / administration capability (dial-in).

TSA answer - The list will be made available within 30 days after the start of the performance period.

16.	C.3.1.1.1.d.2, page 8  Who from TSA approves the “mutually acceptable” trip report format?  What is the current format?  

TSA answer - CO or COTR approves format.  Also see #17 below.      

17.	C.3.1.1.1.e, page 8  Is there currently a set minimum of requirements/baseline or format for the information desired in this report?  .   

TSA answer - The required information on the trip report is as follows:

•	Traveler Name
•	Dates of Travel
•	Travel Locations
•	Purpose of Travel 
•	Airfare 
•	Lodging 
•	Per Diem 
•	Car Rental 
•	Miscellaneous (Description of Miscellaneous Items)

Upon request, additional information may be asked for by TSA to be added to the trip report. 

18.	C.3.1.2, page 8 In regards to documentation and record keeping, the SIR states that these are to be “made available to TSA upon request in TSA’s requested format.”  Is there a pre-determined format?  

TSA answer - “Format” here refers to the data file format not the layout on a sheet of paper.  TSA is interested in receiving data now and in the future that can be read by the system(s) it is using.  Currently, TSA is using Microsoft products.  However, if in the future there is a change to some other product set; TSA reserves the right to request that documents or records be provided in a file format that can be read by the TSA software products in use.

19.	C.3.1.3, page 9  Is this emergency spill response and full support specific to the TSA VAP program or all inclusive of any spill within each federalized airport?  

TSA answer - The contractor shall provide emergency spill response and support for all spills or leaks that occur in TSA occupied space.   

20.	C.3.3.3, page 11 The statement stating, “ The contractor shall not sell or donate materials collected in the performance of this contract” conflicts with C.3.4.  Are we to assume this statement is in reference to the donation or selling of hazardous materials collected only?  

TSA answer - The donation or sale of items under C.3.3.3 is prohibited.  Donation under C.3.4 is a TSA managed and executed activity.  The recycling of materials under C.3.3.3 or C.3.4 is a contractor disposal option.  


21.	C.3.3.3.3, page 12 What type of support is required from the contractor in regards to the sharps/needles mail back program?  

TSA answer - The contractor will be responsible for supporting the mailback program for all interested TSA locations and proposing a program to oversee and implement the program.  

22.	C (overall)  There are many services defined in C such as status reporting, audit, emergency spill response, phone surveys.  How does the government want us to show pricing. CLIN 00002?  

TSA answer - Pricing has not been requested at this time.  If you are invited to submit a
price proposal it will follow Section L instructions for preparation.  This would be included
under CLIN 00002 in a price proposal.   

23.	 Will TSA be defining specific ODCs to allow consistency in all bids?	

TSA answer - CLIN 00006 and its associated option year CLINs do define ODC’s.  

24.	With the airports being divided up by regions, are there specific area/region managers to coordinate Pick-ups? Or is the contractor  always in communication with the 350 Environmental Management Coordinators responsible for the 450+ airports?  

TSA answer - The contractor will be communicating with the Environmental Management Coordinators at the airport for pickups.   

25.	Is it possible to coordinate a site visit for selected contractors, who are invited back for oral's and pricing?  

TSA answer - Each airport is different: Category; operations; facility layout; volumes of materials abandoned and in need of management and disposal; number of personnel allotted to manage VAP; logistics for the pick-up process; and regulatory requirements.  TSA will not coordinate a site visit(s) prior to contract award.

26.	General: Section C.6 is not noted in the SIR; may we assume that  this section is not missing but that the section should be renumbered from C.1 through C.6 instead of through C.7 
TSA answer - Yes
27.	General: Section G4 is referenced twice with different titles; may we assume that the latter section labeled as G4 should be labeled as G.5  
TSA answer - Yes
28.	General: Section H.3 is not noted in the SIR; may we assume that  this section is not missing but that the section should be renumbered from H.1 through H.7 instead of through H.8

32.	Genereal: May we assume that the contract start date is 09-15-06, as stated on pages 1 and 19 vice the start date of 09-16-06, as stated on page 59. 
TSA answer – Yes.
33.	General: May we assume that the transition period ends on 10-31-06 as stated on page 1 vice the end date of 11-1-06 as stated on page 59. 
TSA answer – The intent on page 59 is that the new awardee will be the only contractor 
performing work on Nov 1.  
34.	C.5 Deliverables:

TSA answer - Yes
35.	C.3.1.1.m: May we assume that there a level-of-effort participation threshold for personnel required to complete the TSA designated training that will be designated by TSA upon award. May we assume that this training will be conducted on-line.

TSA answer - The training is expected to take 40 hours per year for each person working on the contract.  The training will be provided by TSA via the internet.  Attendance at this training is considered part of the management CLIN.
.  
36.	C.3.2.f: May we assume that training will be conducted in proximity to easily accessible locations (e.g., Category X, Category I locations). 
TSA answer – No.  Training will be where needed.  If a Cat II airport needs training then it
will be there (i.e. training for MDT won’t necessarily be conducted at PHI or BWI).  
37.	C.7: May we assume that there a level-of-effort participation threshold for personnel required to have a “Secret” security clearance (e.g., designated key personnel) that will be designated by TSA upon award.  May we assume that the clearance process can be initiated upon contract award. May we assume that only prime Contractor personnel are required to have Secret clearance. 

TSA answer - There is no requirement for a “Secret Clearance”. Badging information for all contractor personnel that are expected to enter TSA occupied space at airports, headquarter and the other TSA non-airport locations.  Yes, the clearance process shall begin at the time of award

38.	C.3.1.1.l: May we assume that the badge and credential process will be conducted on an as-needed basis and that temporary badges may be obtained for limited duration activities at TSA locations (e.g., during pickups, during project meetings). 

TSA answer –  At this time, the number of credentials for contractors performing pick-ups will be determined by the contractor.  The credential will be for the expected life of the contract if all options are exercised.  Designated key personnel shall also have similar credentials.

<DESC>TO ALL INTERESTED VENDORS:

TSA posts this amendment to HSTS03-06-R-CAO054 to promote more accurate technical responses.  This is the final amendment and set of clarifications that will be made.  The published deadline for questions has passed and TSA will neither accept nor answer further questions.  Please find below the final set of clarifications.

1 - Regarding amendment 3, question 6.  TSA training refers only to that training necessary to be issued a TSA badge and have access to TSA's IT infrastructure.  Only those employees needing a TSA badge and access to TSA's IT infrastructure need to complete TSA training.

2 - Please bear in mind all bullet points in SOW 3.1.2 for Documentation and Record Keeping.  

Again, no further questions will be accepted.  The deadline for submission of technical responses remains unchanged.  ll be responsible for supporting the mailback program for all interested TSA locations and proposing a program to oversee and implement the program.  
 
13. Will TSA require clearance training (badging) for all drivers? We request that TSA consider excluding drivers who pickup waste and/or deliver containers. We propose considering that these persons can be brought to the sites with an escort from the airport environmental managers or their designees, rather than training them all. 

Please see the response to # 6 above.

<CONTACT>Mark Urciuolo, Contract Specialist, CTR, Phone 571-227-4213, Fax 571-227-2911, Email Mark.Urciuolo@associates.dhs.gov - Marvin Grubbs, Contracting Officer, Phone 571-227-1581, Fax 571-227-2913, Email Marvin.Grubbs@dhs.gov
<DESC>This amendment answers those questions that have so far been posed to TSA about this requirement.  Please find all questions and answers below.  Please contact either Mark Urciuolo or Marvin Grubbs if you have additional questions.  Additionally, please note that you must contact Mark Urciuolo via e-mail for the information in questions 39 and 40.

1.	B.3, page 4  Will the costs associated to the TSA-sponsored training courses such as IT Security, Security Sensitive Information, and ECT… be reimbursed?  

TSA answer - Please see clause 3.13-10.  Contractor Attendance at TSA Sponsored Training (January 2003)

2.	B.3, page 4  In regards to the mention of TSA being tax exempt, will the government name us as a buyer for the government?  Otherwise, the contractor will be required to pay sales tax.  

TSA answer - Yes, the Government will designate the prime contractor as a buyer. 

3.	Top paragraph, page 5  What is the ceiling cap referenced on page 5? There is no ceiling cap listed as referenced in the paragraph.   

TSA answer - No ceiling has yet been established.  The offeror must propose a ceiling as part of its price proposal if it is in fact invited to submit a price proposal.  

4.	C.2, page 6  Under the example list of potential hazardous materials voluntarily abandoned, ammunition, blasting caps, dynamite, fireworks and flares are listed.  These are classified as High Hazardous and the requirements to handle such items differ from the others listed in the example given.  Will you be adding a CLIN to cover the pickup and disposal of high hazardous material?  Taking into consideration this may only happen 10 times annually, the services required for high haz and resources needed significantly impact the costs incurred.  Are these types of costs to be provided as an ODC for these exceptional occurrences? 

TSA answer - All disposal is to be covered under CLIN 00003 and its associated option year CLINs.  Information as to the frequency has been provided to assist the offeror in constructing a single pickup and per container disposal price.  

5.	C.2., page 6  Under the example list of potential hazardous materials voluntarily abandoned, sharps and medical waste are listed.  Can you please define exactly what type of medical waste?  Does this include used and unused waste?  Is any waste biohazardous?  

TSA answer - The biohazards that TSA encounters are needles or syringes, lancets, and razors.   These items are disposed of through a mailback program.  TSA does NOT anticipate the need to manage, handle, or dispose of medical waste - biological materials or hazards (e.g., organisms or viruses infectious to humans, animals or plants; biologically active agents (i.e. toxins, allergens, venoms) that may cause disease in other living organisms; smeared or un-smeared Petri dishes;  vials, test tubes, specimen jars or any  other container that hold or held blood, bodily fluids or serums; jet injectors; pens; infusers; blood glucose meters; blood glucose meter test strips; insulin pumps; and insulin pump supplies; ostomy scissors; and ostomate supply kits and related supplies)..  

6.	C.3.1.1.1.a, page 7  When servicing federalized airports listed in the SIR package, please specify what one time or annual fees have been encountered during the current contract.  

TSA answer - Information relating to the “one time” or annual fees due is posted on the various state and territory environmental web sites.  The fees differ due to generator status or total waste generation combined with a formula.  Annually, under the current contract, fees paid per year range from $5000 to $10,000,.  
 

7.	C.3.1.1.b, page 6  Please define “all” in this context.  Clarification is needed if “all” refers to on-site personnel directly involved with the VAP or if it relates to administrative personnel and indirectly involved contractor staff.  .  

TSA answer - This refers to the on-site personnel that handle, transport, and dispo

<DESC>This amendment to SIR HSTS03-06-R-CAO054 provides the results of the Industry Day held at TSA HQ on 5/23/06.  Below you will find a list of all questions asked and their answers.  Additionally, if you would like a copy of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) used with this procurement, you may contact Mark Urciuolo at mark.urciuolo@associates.dhs.gov or Marvin Grubbs at marvin.grubbs@dhs.gov.  You will receive a copy of the TSA non-disclosure agreeement (NDA).  Complete and sign the NDA and return it to Mark Urciuolo or Marvin Grubbs and you may receive a copy of the SOPs.  

The following are the questions and answers from Industry Day.  

1.  What is the total number of personnel expected to be trained under this contract?
	-This is on an as needed basis.  Some airports may only need 5 people trained while others may need more.  It is based on the needs as they arise for that particular contract year.  Contractor needs to be flexible to present training for small or large groups.

2.  What percentage of the contract will be training?
	-A small percentage.  Training is based on the need for either those that have not been trained or a new requirement.  The training can be specific training or general.  Larger classes can be around 25 people while small is about 5-10 people.  There are times when a class is one-on-one, depending on the need.  There was about $80,000 put on the existing contract for training.

3.  Was training funded on a separate CLIN?
	-yes, $80,000 was funded under the training CLIN on the existing contract.   As with travel, training will be funded on as needed basis and a modification to add funding will be issued.  The Contractor should propose a ceiling value for training in each year.

4.  When will the questions be posted on FedBizOpps?
	-Tentatively on June 15th but this might change depending on the number of questions and how much research needs to be done.  Please submit questions as soon as they arise.

5.  Is there a preference to sending all of the questions at once or one at a time?
	-Either way will be accepted.  Sending a question when it is brought to your attention is accepted.  We will possibly need time to research the question so you are encouraged to send them as soon as you think of them.  All will be posted at once.  

6.  Can the font size deviate from the 12pt. in regard to the header and footer?
	-no, can not deviate from the 12pt. limitation.  Every aspect of the proposal must follow this font size, including the header and footer.

7.  If contractors use teaming or subcontracting, should the proposal include a minimum of three past performance references – 3 per company or 3 per team?
	-There should be a minimum of 3 past performance references in the technical proposal for each prime offeror.  It is incumbent on the offeror to ensure that past performance references are representative of its abilities.  You are welcome to submit more if necessary.

8  The SIR specifies spills, are these referring to VAP specific spills?
	-Yes, any reference to spills, indicate VAP specific spills – directly related to TSA or the contractor’s personnel dealing with a spill after TSA has taken possession of the material in question and extends through the time of disposal.

9.  There are no specific CLINs that address the different classes or types of abandoned property.  Are these to be priced out differently?
	-The SIR does differentiate the different Special Hazardous Materials classes of VAP but does not separate them into different CLINs.  It was not separated out into different CLINs as it would be on a needed basis.  It is not expected that these pick-ups will occur more than 10 times over the contract year.  Everything being pick-up should be priced under CLIN 3.

10.  Can you identify what airports have the mail-back program?
	-Yes, we have a list of these airports.  It is available upon request from Mark Urciuolo.  

11.  Is the Field Environmental S

<DESC>Final Questions and Answers for Solicitation # HSTS03-06-R-CAO054 TSA VAP

1.  What is the number of anticipated pickups at each airport – is there more than one TSDF?  If these are more than one TSDF, how many and what are the addresses?    Would we be required to pick-up waste other than at a TSDF, and if so, where? 

The SOW specifically calls out the minimum number of pickups per Cat per time frame.  The Offeror shall propose which TSDFs it proposes to use.  Those TSDF’s will then become subject to the audits.    

2. What is the volume of pickups (how many 55 gallon drum containers are estimated per month?) 

TSA provided the weight in the answer to a previous question posted earlier.  Please use that stated weight to establish volume.  

3. Please provide pricing for the types of containers listed on Page 11 of Section C.    

This is to be proposed by the Offeror as part of the price proposal, if invited to submit.  

4. Please provide more detailed definitions on kinds of wastes, required/preferred disposal requirements, government directed sites, etc.  

Hazmat is hazmat.  As far as disposal requirements those are set by law, which is something they should know.  

5. Will TSA consider increasing the scope to include VAC services (for sump pumps and oil/water separators)? 

No.  This nothing to do with property left at check points.  

6. Page 4, first paragraph under the line “Please note the following”

 “All contractor personnel will be required to complete and submit a confidential and non-disclosure agreement prior to beginning work.”   Further down this page it also states that “on-site personnel may be required to take annual TSA-sponsored training courses such as IT security, …etc”. 

It’s assumed that these requirements WOULD NOT apply to service personnel who pick, pack, and manifest waste and/or provide VAC Services (if it is added). Please provide additional information regarding to whom these requirements apply. 

Applies to any personnel that would need a TSA badge and access to our infrastructure.  

7. C.7 Security Requirements – please provide clarification on who will need a security clearance.  

Clearance only applicable for SIDA badging if done, everyone else must be US citizen and pass background check, applicable only if getting a TSA badge.  

8. Please provide clarification regarding whether or not the following items are considered as part of the routine waste pickups. 

Special Hazardous Materials – Ammunition, C.3.3.3.2 Special Hazardous materials – Fireworks, any radioactive materials, aerosols and compressed gas cylinders, medical waste or other kinds of ammunition: blasting caps, flares, dynamite or fireworks.  

SOW specifically states max 10 pickups per year.  

9. Please provide clarification on whether or not the specialized wastes are ALWAYS handled as one-off pickups and not assumed to be handled with the other wastes.  

Pickups of the specialized wastes are to be handled separately from the other waste. 

10. Will materials be segregated and is there a holding time for any of the materials? Will certain items be able to stay onsite until a certain quantity is reached to be picked up? 

Materials are stored onsite at airport prior to pickup.  Pickups must occur at a minimum as called out in the SOW and must also be performed when requested by an airport.  

11. Will TSA provide any manifests for the materials previously handled? Please provide any information based on previous VAP experience.  

TSA will not provide manifests for previous pickups by the current contractor.  The contractor should be aware of the manifest requirements.   

12. Please provide any previous contractor information regarding what type of “support” is required from the contractor in regards to the sharps/needles mail back program including all interested TSA locations. What are TSA’s expectations for “support”?  

As answered earlier, the contractor wiupport contract at all a part of this contract?
	-No, this contract is totally separate.

12.  What kind of interaction will there be with the existing Environmental Support contract?
	-The environmental support contract services the field in any environmental support needed.  The field might have a specific question that may be directed toward this contractor, but may have to be answered by you and therefore you would be the contact.  We will need the contractor to be able to give correct and timely responses to the field.  

13.  Please further define the CLINs and verbiage such as CONUS, 
	-CONUS = Continental United States.  OCONUS = Outside Continental United States.  AK = Alaska.  HI = Hawaii.  PR = Puerto Rico.  SP = South Pacific.  USVI = United States Virgin Islands.  These refer to the regions of the U.S. and all locations contain TSA federal airports that will potentially need service under this contract.

14.  Will the list of CLINs be changed, adding disposal of materials at other locations?
	-We will clarify the definitions and the list of airport categories.  All additional definitions needed were included in the Statement of Work

15.  Regarding the disposal CLIN, 3ae.  This needs to be one price regardless of what is going into the container?
	-We are looking for one fixed-price per container.  A fixed-price pick-up fee regardless of what you are picking –up.  These prices may differ between regions, but we are looking for one price.

16.  Where would the requirements for audits and research fall?
	-Audits will be performed on facilities, that is TSDFs.  TSDF audits fall under this category.  You will be expected to make sure TSA is following requirements and protocol.  The audits would fall under CLIN 00002 in the base year and the “0001” series of CLINs for the option years.  

17.  What vehicle was used for the existing contract?
	-This was a fixed-price Task Order awarded under GSA Schedule 899.  The current requirements are being competed as full-and open.

18.  What percentage of small business use is expected?
	-We do not require small business use, but this is an evaluation factor and therefore a strength detailed in Section M.  No use of small business will be a deficiency.

19.  Would suggestions to TSA be placed in the Technical Proposal?
	-Any suggestions would be part of your technical proposal, but you will need to clarify why these suggestions would be in the best interest of TSA.

20.  In today’s discussion, you had made reference to a new environmental information system being established by the TSA Hazmat Mgmt Program.  How would that impact the Hazmat Management Contractor. Specifically:
-	Does the automated reporting system need to interface with this new environmental information system? If so, is it possible to obtain some basic information about this system?
-	Who is the current contractor serving in the role of Environmental Management Support Contractor (i.e., who is establishing this new system with which the automated reporting system may need to connect into)? Is the Environmental Management Support Contractor eligible to bid on the Hazardous Materials Management contract? 

We made reference to a new Environmental Management System (EMS) being implemented by TSA and our Environmental Support Services contractor. This EMS is similar to the EMS as described by the ISO 14000 requirements.  The Hazmat Management Contractor will be responsible for the technical and logistical hazardous materials management support services such as providing containers, ensuring proper container identification, marking, labeling, packaging, shipping, and final treatment of the collected materials.  The EMS is TSA's management tool. We do not foresee the web based automated reporting and tracking system, called for in this procurement, receiving or processing data or information from the EMS.  Rather, reports from the web based automated reporting and tracking system may be fed to the EMS.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions received from potential offerors:

1.  Q. Will the selected WM system vendor(s) be permitted to attend and participate in the actual fire testing of the COTS system? 
     A.  They will be encouraged to attend.

2.  Q.  Will the vendor be involved in the installation and positioning of the nozzles in the test mock-up and pre-testing of the WM system? 
    A.   It is important that the vendor be involved in all aspects of the installation and testing.

3.  Q.  Does the proposal pricing cover only the price of nozzle hardware and installation data or should it also include for the supply of high pressure pump/motor units and motor controller?  
    A.  SHADWELL currently has several high pressure pumps and systems.  It is the Navy’s intention to make this available to the vendor if it meets their requirements.  If the vendor feels the Navy equipment will bias their test, then the vendor should propose their pump and distribution system with a rationale as to why the Navy system will not meet their requirements.  

4.   Q.  Will the Piping take the pressure of 100 bar?
     A.   The piping will take the pressure (100 bar), but the flanges will not.  In order for the offeror to use the current system with their pump, they would have to change out the flanges.

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 339111 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to procure a Picosecond Laser System that would be suitable for pursuing picosecond time-resolved X-ray studies of structural dynamics in proteins.  This laser system will be installed on the BioCARS time-resolved X-ray beamline (Sector 14) at the Advanced Photon Source in Argonne, IL. The picosecond laser amplifier must be capable of generating 1-2 picosecond, 790 nm pulses at a repetition frequency of 1 kHz with < 2% rms pulse energy fluctuations. These pulses must be synchronized to an external 70.4 or 88 MHz RF source to a precision better than 1 ps rms.  The amplifier must be externally triggerable to a precision of 1 ns from 1 Hz to 1 kHz. The beam divergence must have an M-squared < 1.5, and the amplifier should be designed to minimize Kerr lensing. The pump laser(s) for the picosecond amplifier should be cooled by a water-to-water heat exchanger to minimize heat dissipation in the laser lab. The laser system must include a ps TOPAS optical parametric amplifier (OPA from Light Conversion, Ltd.) with tunability from 230 nm to 2 microns, and its pump pulse energy must be sufficient (4.5-5 mJ) to generate at least 100 microjoules pulse energy at the 4th harmonic of the Signal (320-380 nm range). The TOPAS must be equipped with harmonic separators to isolate the desired wavelength over its tuning range, and must include Light Conversion?s polarization control accessory to set the polarization of the target wavelength to vertical. The entire system must fit on a 4?x10? optical table with sufficient space left over for installing the beam separation and beam steering optics needed to deliver the picosecond pulses from the laser hutch to the X-ray hutch. The laser system should be delivered in mid-November, 2006.

<CONTACT>Jeffrey W. Sneddon SUPV Contract Specialist 3073442080     Jeffrey_sneddon@nps.gov;
<DESC>The following information relays questions and answers concerning this solicitation to all interested bidders. This announcement constitutes as an amendment to the combined synopsis/solicitation # Q1573067057. The response date is now extended to 2:00pm Mountain Standard Time, Monday, September 11, 2006. Question: Does the chassis GVWR need to be below 26500 lbs for CDL concerns, because the log loader with a 28' reach will probably weigh 7000 to 8000 lbs so you'll need a chassis with a FAWR of 12,000 - 14,000 lbs to support the weight of the loader so that will put you into a truck with at least a 33,000 lbs GVWR.   Answer: No, there are no CDL concerns. A larger chassis is fine. Question: What size grapple do you want ¼, 1/3, or ½ cord.   Answer: We are not familiar with these units of measure.  We would like a grapple that can grasp a 40" diameter log.   Question: Also it states you want to pick - up chips do you want a chip attachment? Answer: No, we want a removable top for the bed such that chips can be blown into the back of it by a towed wood chipper.   Question: I've attached a photo of a log loader that folds into its cradle over the cab, is this what you have in mind? The reason for this is the length of the boom because it would be to long to rest in the 12' dump bed.  Answer: We do not want a boom that will rest in the bed.  We prefer a boom that folds horizontally behind the cab, however we will take a model arranged with the boom over the cab as depicted.  We want to be very clear that we are not looking for a logging truck. Question: How high of a removable chip cap would you want on the dump body?  Answer: 5-6 feet is customary.  Question: The bid mentions at least three storage compartments do you know what size they'll need to be, mounting locations, aluminum or steel construction of the boxes?  Answer: Either steel or aluminum is fine.  We prefer one horizontal compartment to be 48" x 16 x 16 to hold chainsaws.  The others can be any dimension so long as the hold 3 cubic feet of volume. Question: In the RFQ it never specifies hydraulic out and down outriggers. Are hydraulic outriggers required?  Answer: They are. Question: Do you require cranes with a remote control option or one with top seat controls?  Answer: Either will work, but our preference is top seat for safety through increased visibility. Question: The cab and chassis will a quote be acceptable on a F 750 with a 10,000 front axle, or is it necessary to get into a International or Sterling?   Answer: An F-750 is fine.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency located in Montgomery,Alabama is seeking a quote from interested parties in providing mixed gamma reference standards containing an approximate total radioactivity of 200 nanocuries each.
1.  Intended use: The standards will be owned by EPA, but will be possessed and used by a variety of individuals and/or organizations at various geographic locations in the United States and it territories, who do not have a specific license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or an Agreement State to possess or use radioactive materials.  
2.  Radionuclides: The standards are to be prepared with a mixture of radionuclides with half lives of no less than 100 days, that collectively emit at least eight gamma rays at discrete energies that do not interfere with each other, nominally covering the energy range of 50 to 2000 KeV.   Typical sodium iodide detector resolution may be assumed, and interfering gammas.  No alpa-emitting radionuclides are permitted in the standards.   The radionuclides used in the mixture must individually and collectively qualify for exempt quantity designation under Part C, Appendix B of the Council of Radiation Control Program Directors Suggested State Regulations for Control of Radiation, or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations in 10 CFR 30.71 Schedule B (attached), whichever is more restrictive.   The following mixture is preferred; however, alternate mixtures may be proposed provided that they meet the above requirements: a)Pb-210-approximately 80nCi; b) Cd-109-approximately 60nCi; c) Co-57-approximately 4.5 nCi; d) Ce-139-approximately 5.5 nCi; e) Sn-113-approximately 16 nCi; f)Cs-137-approximately 5.5nCi; g) Y-88-approximately 16nCi; h)Co-60-approximately 9 nCi
3.  Transportation requirements.  Each standard must also conform to the conditions and limitations specified in 49 CFR 173.421 for exempted package-limited quantity of material.   In evlauating conformance to the package dose rate limits of these regulations, it may be assumed that the standard will be packaged such the minimum distance from any surface of the source to the outside of the package is at least three inches.
4.  Physical requirements: The radioactive material shall be uniformly deposited on a 3.25 inch diameter area polyester filter paper.   The filter paper willbe provided by the EPA.  The filter paper should then be sealed or encapsulated with plastic tape or film, or other suitable material, to prevent contact with or loss of radioactive material when handled exercising reasonable care to prevent damage.  The final finished diameter of the standards shall be 4 inches, and the finished thickness shall not be more than 1/16" greater than the clean filter media provided by EPA for making the standards.
5.  Calibration certificate: A certificate must be provided for each standard that specifies the quantity of each radioistope contained therein, as well as the uncertainty of that quantity and the date of assay.  Units may be in curies or bequerels or any combination of the preceding.   The certificate must clearly communicate what values are certified, and must list the nuclear data references used for obtaining half lives or branching ratios used in deriving any information presented on the certificate that is calculated rather than directly measured.
6. Traceability of calibration: Calibration of the standards must be traceable to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), or the National Standards Body of a country recognized by NIST through international agreement.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK

Interior Communications and Information System Criteria
For
Sheppard Air Force Base Facilities


This document identifies and defines Sheppard AFB?s requirements and policies for designing and installing internal telecommunications data infrastructure within Sheppard AFB facilities.  Design standards are based on, and, installation of data cables must be in accordance with EIA/TIA 568-B, Commercial Building Telecommunications Cabling Standard, EIA/TIA 569-A, Commercial Building Standard for Telecommunications Pathways and Spaces, and TIA/EIA-606, Administration Standard for Commercial Telecommunications Infrastructure.  Design or installation questions shall be referred to the 82 CS/SCX staff for resolution.


Standard Telecommunications Outlet:

The standard outlet must consist of two 8-pin/8-position CAT 5e modular USOC RJ-45 jacks mounted in a single faceplace (one jack for telephone (on top) and one for data use (on bottom)) in a factory-made assembly.  For data cable only installations, the top jack, voice, will be reserved for future use.

Outlet boxes shall be no smaller than 50 mm wide, 75 mm high and 64 mm deep (2 in, 3 in, 25 in).

Color of hardware used in office areas will be neutral in color, (tan, beige, ivory, gray, etc) and blend with the surrounding d?cor.  Adhesive-backed hardware shall not be used.

When terminating category 5e and higher cables, the cable pair twists shall be maintained to within 13 mm (0.5 in) from the point of termination.

Telecommunications outlets shall always be located within three (3) feet of an electrical outlet.

Communications Wiring:

Client jacks will be Category 5e rated Universal Service Order Code (USOC) registered jack (RJ)-45, wired with CAT 5e four-pair, No. 24 AWG solid copper, 100 ohm, plenum rated, unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable in accordance with TIA/EIA-568-B, Commercial Building Telecommunications Cabling Standard.  Use the T568B termination configuration.  Terminate all client drops on CAT 5e rated patch panels.

Building telecommunications (telephone and LAN) distribution systems must meet TIA/EIA-568-B, TIA/EIA-569-A, Commercial Building Standards for Telecommunications Pathways and Spaces, TIA/EIA-606, Administration Standard for the Telecommunications Infrastructure of Commercial Building, and TIA/EIA-607, Commercial Building Grounding and Bonding Requirements for Telecommunications.

Telecommunications cabling is always installed in a home-run fashion with individual cables running from the work area all the way to the telecommunications closet.  Splices in horizontal distribution cable are not allowed.  Terminate all client drops on CAT 5e rated patch panels in the communications cabinet.  Where existing patch panels cannot accommodate the new cabling, the contractor must install a new Category 5e rated patch panel, similar to existing, in the communications cabinet.  Coordinate placement of new patch panels with 82 CS/SCX.  TIA/EIA-568-B allows a maximum distance of 90 meters (295 feet) from the client outlet to the telecommunications room.

Cable and components shall be visually inspected for proper installation.  Cable stress, such as that caused by tension in suspended cable runs and tightly cinched bundles, should be minimized.  Cable ties used to bundle cables should be applied loosely to allow the cable tie to slide around the cable bundle.  The cable ties should not be cinched so tightly as to deform the cable sheath.  Cable placement should not deform the cable sheath.

The minimum bend radius, under no-load conditions, for 4-pair unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cable shall be four times the cable diameter.

All wiring will be terminated to the T568B wiring standard:

Eight-position jack pin/pair assignment (T568B)

 

At the telecommunications cabinet, all cables and wiring installed shall be labeled, D-ring supported, dressed, and fanned in a neat manner.  Ensure that the wire closet/centers and work areas are clean and free of debris.  Wiring installed above suspended ceilings and under false floors will be concentrated and routed along the supporting members of the structure and not across tiles or openings.

Limit exposed wiring located in the work area.  If necessary, temporarily remove carpeting, panels, molding, or other hardware for the purpose of installation and restore to original condition.

Where cables terminate in modular furniture, the cables shall be run through the communications raceways built into the modular furniture.

All wiring in walls, under floors, above ceilings, etc, shall be concealed to the maximum extent possible in office, maintenance, and data areas.  Use moldings ducts, conduits, raceways, utility poles, etc, where installation of house wiring within walls is impractical.

Conduit:

The use of conduit for telecommunications cabling shall be from the telecommunications outlet to above the false ceiling.  Conduit shall be a minimum of ?? electrical metallic and nonmetallic tubing, nonmetallic flexible conduit and nonmetallic flexible tubing, rigid metal conduit, or rigid nonmetallic conduit.  Conduits shall be reamed to eliminate sharp edges; metallic conduit shall be terminated with an insulated bushing.  Pull string or rope shall be placed in installed conduits.

Support Structures:

Where zone conduit or cable tray is not available in a suspended ceiling space and where telecommunications cables are allowed to be placed in the ceiling, adequate open top cable supports, such as bridle rings or J-hooks, located on 48-60 inch centers, shall be provided.  Where large quantities of cables (50-75 cables) are bunched together in a ceiling at a congested area special supports shall be designed and installed to carry the additional weight.  A suspended ceiling support rod or wire may be used to mount appropriate cable fasteners loaded with multiple cables up to the total weight for which the fastener is approved.  The fastener design shall not interfere with the inserting or removal of ceiling tile.  All cable no longer in use will be removed and not abandoned.  Cable and wiring support hardware will be self supporting (i.e., not rely on or be supported by other pipes, cables, or conduits).  Cables entering and leaving a conduit or duct will be supported so the cable is not stressed at the rim of the conduit.

Telecommunications cable may not be attached directly to electrical conduit, T-bar ceiling support wires, or any non-communications cabling.

The pathway shall be sized to support the initial installation of cable, plus 25% growth.

All wall outlets shall have a minimum three quarter (3/4)-inch conduit routing through the wall to an accessible cable pulling location.

Cable shall not be laid directly on the ceiling tile or rails.  A minimum of 75 mm (3 in) clear vertical space shall be available above the ceiling tiles for horizontal cabling and pathway.


Telecommunications System Management Records:

Telecommunication system labeling, management records, and drawings must comply with TAI/EIA-606.

All outlets, patch panel positions, and cables must be labeled with machine made labels as to their function with a unique identifier code and a designation for the intended use such as ?V? for voice and ?D? for data.

As-built drawings and management records must show the location of all outlets, equipment, and cabling including identifier assignments, show pathway locations and routing, configuration of telecommunications spaces including backboard and equipment rack configurations.  These records must be provided as a deliverable item under any construction procurement contract.  They will form part of the base Communications and Information Systems Installation Records (CSIR) and must be delivered to the base communications officer upon contract completion according to AFI 33-104, Base Level Planning and Implementation, and AFI 21-404, Developing and Maintaining Communications and Computer Systems Installation Records.  Provide accurate paper, two sets of E size drawings, and electronic updates in Micro Station format.  No other electronic format is compatible with the EDSC database.


Testing:

All cabling must be tested end-to-end and certified to meet TIA/EIA 568-B performance standards.  All test results and certifications must be provided in a report upon completion of construction to 82 CS/SCX.  The minimum test results include:

	a) Wire map
	b) Length
	c) Insertion loss
	d) Near-end crosstalk (NEXT) loss
	e) Power sum near-end crosstalk (PSNEXT) loss
	f) Equal-level far-end crosstalk (ELFEXT)
	g) Power sum equal-level far-end crosstalk (PSELFEXT)
	h) Return loss
	i) Propagation delay
	j) Delay skew

Upon delivery of the test report, 82 CS will conduct a visual inspection of the installed cable and support structures to ensure conformance with EIA/TIA standards.  All discrepancies must be corrected prior to system acceptance.
