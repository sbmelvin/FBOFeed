HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

According to the language included in FAR Case 2001-026, vendors are required to use ORCA beginning 1 January 2005.  Detailed information can be found in the FAR Case, as well as by visiting the Help section of the website at http://orca.bpn.gov. The help section includes ORCA background information, frequently asked questions (FAQ), the ORCA Handbook, and whom to call for assistance.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Chelton, Inc. 1720 Lakepointe Dr. Suite 112, Lewisville, Texas 75057 on a sole source basis for one (1) Tunable Antenna, P/N: 30-124, and one (1) Logic Control Unit (LCU), P/N: 7-151/30. These communication antennas are currently used on the Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC). These communication antennas provided the performance required to allow the craft to meet the established communication. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The communication antennas will be required to interface with and be 100% backward compatible and easily integrated with the existing hardware and software currently in use on the LCAC system. This level of compatibility and integration are required to prevent communication loss during at-sea operations. Use of other manufacturers equipment would cost the government additional time and money while attempting to integrate!  the systems that in turn would negatively impact delivery of the system to the fleet. Thus Chelton, Inc. is the only vendor that can meet this requirement. A firm-fixed-price contract is anticipated. The anticipated award date will be on or about April 25, 2005. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.. NAICS Code 334220 applies. SBA Size Standard is 750 employees. FSC is 5826.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requests proposals for a Contractor to operate The Charters Café, which is opened for the convenience of visitors, staff, contractors, and researchers in the newly renovated National Archives Building, located in Washington, DC.  The building is open to the public every day of the year except December 25th; hours are seasonal.  The basic period of operation will be Monday through Friday, during the hours of 7am until 4pm.  Vendors may be asked to accommodate weekend and evening peak periods by extending hours of operation. Statistics maintained indicate over one million visitors come to NARA each year.    
NARA, an independent Federal agency, is America's national record keeper.  The mission is to ensure ready access to the essential evidence that documents the rights of American citizens, the actions of Federal officials, and the national experience.  Among the treasures available are the cornerstone documents of our Government —the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights, as well as many of our current and past exhibits.  In addition to housing the Charters of Freedom, access is provided to historians interpreting the past, journalist researching stories, students preparing term papers, Indian tribes pressing claims, and persons tracing their ancestry or satisfying their curiosity about particular historical events.  
The Charters Café is designed largely as a limited service grab-and-go operation. The vendor should offer made-to-order breakfast and lunch menu items of sandwiches, wraps, salads, soups, and light fare prepared daily.  Eat healthy options should be included on the menu. Continental breakfast, afternoon snacks, and desserts will also be offered. Pre-packaged factory-produced sandwiches and salads can be served. Beverages will include coffee, tea, waters, soft drinks, and juices. There is limited cooking on the premises.  Hot foods that can be prepared on electric appliances will be permitted. The operator is encouraged to have daily lunch specials as well as seasonal theme specials.
The vendor is expected to accommodate the influx of seasonal visitors, pre-arranged tour groups, and daily building occupants of NARA staff, contractors, and researchers. There will be requests by building event staff to accommodate training and lecture groups with boxed lunches and to provide beverages and pastries for meetings. There are approximately 500 NARA staff and contractors in the building daily.
The contract awarded as a result of the forthcoming RFP will be a No Cost contract with Department of Labor wage determinations incorporated. The term of the contract will be for a Base Period of twelve (12) months with four (4) 12-month Option Periods. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 722310. All responsible business sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by NARA. Copies of the RFP, which will be available on or about April 29, 2005, may be obtained through the Federal Business Opportunities web site at www.fedbizopps.gov. It is the Offeror’s responsibility to monitor this site for the release of the solicitation and amendments, if any. All Contractors interested in receiving notification of updates/amendments to the solicitation posted on the EPS are urged to enroll on the web site mailing list for this acquisition. Those Contractors enrolled will be notified automatically of any changes made to the RFP through their e-mail addresses. No telephone or faxed RFP request will be accepted.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the purchase of 300 RTSX-SU series, RTSX32SUCQ208B Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), programmable logic devices, for NASA independent testing.  NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Actel Corporation, for the following reasons:  (a) There have been a number of reported and confirmed failures in these devices in both NASA and Department of Defense applications. Actel has developed a new programming algorithm which is believed to mitigate and perhaps eliminate the presence of sensitive outlier devices.  (b) Actel is uniquely qualified for this acquisition, since they are the sole manufacturer of this part, and there are no compatible substitute components available. The Actel components are designed and installed in a large number of NASA spacecraft, and representative samples of Actel devices are required for component level testing.  (c) These components are manufactured by a single vendor, which is Actel, and no qualified alternatives exist. Market research was not conducted, since substitute components are not suitable for an evaluation of NASA flight hardware, which uses Actel parts.  (d) Representative Actel samples must be used for the NASA independent test effort. No other vendor is currently making form, fit, function, and performance compatible substitutes for the SX-S series devices that would yield test results that have significance to NASA missions that have designed in the SX-S series FPGAs.  NOTE: This is a readvertisement from Solicitation No. NNG05104087Q, which was cancelled. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13-5. The Authority is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 23, 2005. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/JSC/White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) plans to procure test and evaluation services at WSTF as a partial follow-on to the current Test Evaluation and Maintenance (TEAM) contract which ends April 30, 2006.  The potential contract will require materials and components testing, propulsion testing, depot level repair of flight hardware, and maintenance and repair of the test systems required for these activities. Activities under TEC include: test system safety, quality assurance, technical training, precision cleaning and fluid component refurbishment, calibration, machining and welding, maintenance of special PPE, photo and video, electronic and audio-visual equipment maintenance, and technical editing. WSTF is certified to the ISO 9001 and 14001 standards as a joint government and contractor team, and is an OSHA VPP Star certified site. Interested parties are encouraged to address their experience in working within these environments.   To fulfill these requirements, NASA plans to release a Request For Proposal (RFP).  The RFP will result in a Cost Plus Award Fee, 100% performance based, contract with both a Completion Form and an IDIQ (indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity) feature.	The contract will be written for a 3 year base period with two, 1-year options for a total of five years.  A draft RFP will be released mid-May 2005. The draft RFP will allow interested parties the opportunity to submit questions, comments, and innovative ideas. Feedback can be submitted up to 10 days after the draft RFP release date and is encouraged. A listing of small businesses which have expressed interest in participating in this procurement will be released with the draft RFP. A preproposal conference will be held May 24 and 25, 2005 at WSTF.  After considering Industry feedback impacts on the draft RFP, the Government anticipates that the final RFP will be released in late June 2005. The Government contemplates requiring the offerors to submit the past performance portion of their proposals in early August with the remaining portion of the proposals due mid-August. A 60-day phase-in for the new contractor is planned.  The solicitation and, to the extent possible, documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.   The Internet site, or URL, for the TEC Procurement is	      http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/team/	       Documents unavailable over the Internet will be made available in the Technical Reference Library (TRL) at WSTF.	Additional information about the TRL at WSTF will be posted on the website at a later date. All qualified responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:	 http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html	   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.

<CONTACT>Marlene Brooks, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-205-9664, Fax 202-260-0855, Email mbrooks@ibb.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) intends to negotiate a non-competitive contract modification against Contract No. BBGCON3604C5429 with Harris Corporation (Harris), Broadcast Communications Division, 3200 Wismann Lane, P.O. Box 4290, Quincy, IL 62305 for the fabrication and shipping of a medium power (5kW - 20kW) PAL/B UHF Television (TV) broadcasting system and ancillary equipment for installation at the Shomali Iraqi Media Network (IMN) Broadcast Station, Al-Hilla, Iraq.  Current plans are to procure a 10kW, PAL/B Channel 35 television system.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition that is applicable to this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1 -- Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Harris Corporation was previously awarded a contract (No. BBGCON3604C5469) to provide PAL/B television systems to support the urgent U.S. Government requirement for the BBG to establish TV broadcasting systems in Iraq.  The initial requirement specifically included BBG's launch and operation of the first two TV broadcasting systems in Baghdad and Basrah, Iraq and subsequently up to three (3) additional broadcast systems in other Iraqi cities.  Not achieving this Iraq TV broadcasting system operating capability would result in the BBG not meeting the U.S. Congress' compelling mandate for the timely establishment of BBG TV broadcasting systems that will provide television programming to the Iraqi people in key cities, pursuant to authorization and appropriation of FY-2004/05 funding for this specific purpose.  

Under its contract, Harris Corporation completed all of its initial delivery requirements for a 5kW PAL/B VHF Channel 12 television system by the established contract delivery date.  The system is currently operational in Baghdad.  The contract was modified to procure a second PAL/B Channel 12 television system from Harris Corporation.  This system will soon be installed in Mosul, Iraq.  BBG presently has a follow-up requirement for a 10kW, PAL/B UHF Channel 35 television system to be installed at the Shomali IMN Broadcast Station in Al-Hilla, Iraq.  The BBG intends to modify its existing contract with Harris Corporation to procure the UHF TV system.

The UHF TV system to be procured by the BBG will be installed along with other Harris PAL/B UHF TV and FM transmitters provided by Harris Corporation under a separate contract managed by the Iraqi Media Network.  Iraqi Media Network personnel have been fully trained in the installation, operation and maintenance of Harris VHF/UHF TV and FM broadcast equipment.  Due to the security and logistic difficulties in Iraq, BBG broadcast equipment installed at IMN facilities must be compatible with existing Harris equipment to facilitate maintenance, allow for the procurement and storage of spare parts, and simplify operation of the transmitters.  

The 10kW, PAL/B UHF Channel 35 TV system that Harris Corporation will be required to fabricate and provide shall include television transmitter(s) and other television broadcasting equipment, including but not limited to television combiner systems, transmission lines, and power regulation equipment, export pack and provide for shipping of the above-stated TV broadcasting system and equipment to the Shomali IMN Broadcast Station in Al-Hilla, Iraq.  The TV system shall be shipped from Harris' facility to the BBG in Washington, DC and received by the BBG no later than August 1, 2005.  The BBG will use a separate contract for the installation of the BBG TV broadcasting system to be installed at the Shomali IMN Broadcast Station in Al-Hilla, Iraq.  

This Public Notice of the BBG's intent to non-competitively contract with Harris Corporation is not a solicitation (Request for Proposals).  Other firms that are interested in the BBG's requirements for major equipment fabrication and shipping of TV broadcasting systems in Iraq may respond to this Public Notice by stating their interest, capabilities, and pertinent experience to meet the BBG's TV broadcasting systems requirements cited in the notice as well as the continued requirement for a presence in Iraq that specifically includes the August 1, 2005 Shomali TV Station broadcasting system delivery deadline.  The responses of interested firms shall include:  (1) evidence of specific examples of the respondent's successful past performance with a minimum of five (5) years experience in the fabrication, shipping, installation, testing, commissioning, and sustained operation and maintenance of Harris television broadcast systems; (2) data sheets, brochures or other documentation clearly describing the proposed VHF and UHF television broadcast system equipment sized for medium to large urban environments; and (3) a sample project plan, including but not limited to a project schedule, bill of materials, description of activities, and budgetary cost to deliver a 10kW UHF television broadcasting system by August 1, 2005.     

The BBG must receive all such "Capabilities Statements" by 2:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), May 2, 2005.  The BBG's determination not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this Public Notice, is solely within the discretion of the BBG.  Any "Capabilities Statements" and/or other information received by the BBG from interested firms responding to this Public Notice will be considered by the BBG solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any questions regarding this Public Notice shall be submitted via facsimile to Marlene Brooks, Office of Contracts (M/CON/CR), at (202) 260-0855.  Written responses to this Public Notice shall also be facsimiled to Marlene Brooks at (202) 260-0855.  Telephone responses of a firm's statements of interest, capabilities, and pertinent experience will not be accepted by the BBG.  This Public Notice is not a RFP, IFB, or RFQ.  Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>This synopsis replaces the synopsis posted on October 15, 2004 due to a change in Contract Specialists/Contracting Officers. This solicitation modifies the list of potential tasks and the selection criteria and requires interested firms to submit their qualifications using only the SF 330. This applies to firms that have previously responded with their SF 254s and SF 255s as well as those that have not yet responded. Firms that previously responded with their SF 330s do not re-submit. The response date is open and will remain open indefinitely. Note: You will not be notified unless your firm has been selected to perform a task (see below).

In this synopsis, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AO) requests submission of SF 330s (only) by Architectural/Engineering firms desiring to be considered for government contracts not to exceed $100,000. The SF 330 information will be compiled and managed in a database by a permanent AO Architect/Engineer Selection Board. Please do not submit any information other than the SF 330 as it will be discarded. Only the SF 330 will be filed and stored, and only information in the SF 330 will be entered in the database and considered for potential tasks. No actual contract documentation or construction administration (or new building designs) will result as part of these broad-based Architectural/Engineering services tasks. Tasks will consist of providing limited assistance to the judiciary and the AO on individual projects, primarily as conducted for the judiciary by the General Services Administration (GSA). Tasks may include, but are not limited to, project-related program and design analysis and evaluation; small scale schematic design; furniture and interiors services; technical document reviews; value engineering services; architectural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and structural analysis and evaluation; historical preservation studies; courtroom technologies consultation; blast-resistant and security design criteria development; environmental (sick building) testing and analysis; and preparation of other studies and reports to support the judiciary. Potential tasks will be geographically located only throughout the 50 United States and the U.S. Territories. Travel may be, but is not always, required. In no prioritized order of importance, individual tasks will be awarded to firms based on a combination of the following criteria: (1) Past performance on contracts with the judiciary, other government entities, and private industry, in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with the U.S. Courts Design Guide and performance schedules; (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required; (3) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services; (4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; and (5) Staffed location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality. In making the award determination for each task the AO Architect/Engineer Selection Board will rank the firms most qualified to perform the work and provide its list to the Contracting Officer (CO) who will review it, make the final selection list, attempt to negotiate a fair and reasonable price with the firm ranked first and, if successful, award to that firm. If unsuccessful, the CO will attempt to negotiate with the next firm on the list and so forth, until award is made or it is necessary to request an additional listing from the selection board. This process will continue until award is accomplished.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>10--Intermediate-depth Naval Sea Mine (Request for Information)
<SOLNBR>N0002405R6313
<RESPDATE>051505
<CONTACT>Carol Brown, 202-781-4875
<DESC>This purpose of this modification to the previous notice is to advise that a NDIA Medium Depth Mine PowerPoint presentation given in March 2005 is available by e-mail request to carol.a.brown@navy.mil with the subject "2010 Mine Presentation Request." This presentation will provide additional details on the intermediate-depth naval sea mine we are seeking information regarding. All other aspects of this notice are unchanged. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) seeks information from firms capable of providing naval sea mine development, test and evaluation in support of the United States Navy.  THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE, BUT RATHER A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION from industry that will support the development of a set of concepts to be evaluated in a trade-off study to select the best candidate for a rapid acquisition program for a new naval sea mine.  The information sought herein is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a Request For Proposal (RFP) or as any obligation or commitment on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service.  There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise to pay for any inform! ation submitted by respondents to this request. Objective.  Identify candidate technologies for use in a future intermediate-depth naval sea mine.  Leverage industry expertise to identify and assess candidate technology systems and subsystems that meet the criteria and capabilities described in this request for information. Background.  The United States has utilized sea mines since the time of the Revolutionary War.  Today’s modern sea mine has evolved into an autonomous system that detects target signatures, localizes the target with target motion algorithms, and engages the target by detonating the mine warhead at the target’s closest point of approach.  Recently, interest has developed for using mines to support all the pillars of Sea Power 21, since they obviate the need for force-on-force engagement. The U.S Navy presently has two classes of sea mine systems in-service.  The first class is a series of sea bottom-sitting explode-in-place mines that are effective in waters shallower than about 200 feet.  They include the Mines Mk 62, 63, and 65, commonly referred to as Quickstrike Mines.  Quickstrike Mines contain Target Detecting Devices (TDDs) that contain magnetic, pressure, and seismic sensors to identify and localize targets.  The other sea bottom-sitting mine is the Mine Mk 67, or Submarine Launched Mobile Mine (SLMM) that can be covertly planted from submarines at long stand off ranges.  SLMM uses the same TDDs as Quickstrike.  Because these mines sit on the bottom, they become warhead limited at depths below about 200 feet. At the deeper depths the second class of mine, the Mine Mk 56 is used.  The Mine Mk 56 is an explode-in-place moored mine, where the case can be moored at a pre-selectable depth.  This mine is used in the intermediate water depth regime, generally from about 150 feet to 1100 ft, and can target both submarines and surface combatants.  However, to obtain coverage in depth against all targets, a large number of mines are required at different depths.  Since the mine is large and only deployed by aircraft, an undesirably large number of sorties are required to plant an effective minefield.  Furthermore, the Mk 56 ‘s utility is limited due to its lack of remote command and control capability.  The Mine Mk 56 is scheduled for removal from service in the year 2010. Discussion.  The U.S. Navy has initiated the development of a new mine system to replace the Mine Mk 56 in intermediate water depths.  A spiral development program of a modular mine system is planned, beginning with an initial increment that will integrate existing mature technologies.  Two near-term goals for the new mine are: ·	Minimizing the number of delivery sorties required to lay a minefield.	  ·	Remote control of the minefield.   Minimizing delivery sorties could be accomplished by using a wide-area coverage mine, or by providing the mine with a propulsion system, thus making the mine self-delivering over a considerable distance.   Wide area coverage would normally be achieved by detecting, localizing, and tracking the target at long range and propelling the warhead to the target, although other innovative techniques for achieving target mission abort damage are welcome.  Each mine would cover a larger area, reducing the number of mines required.  A self-delivering mine could use underwater glider or other technologies that allow the mine to travel long distances.  This could be extended to provide a mobile minefield, with the location under a battle commander’s control. The mine system must also be wirelessly controllable in order to render the minefield safe for short periods of time while friendly ships transit the minefield.  This would also allow deactivated mines to be planted ahead of hostilities, then activated should deterrence fail and hostilities break out.  Robust communications and control of the minefield could also be used to sterilize the minefield and/or aid in recovery when the minefield is no longer required. Initially the mine must have the flexibility to be deliverable from a variety of surface ships (delivery system modularity) and from air platforms.  Currently, U.S. mines are delivered by bomber, fighter, or attack aircraft, however delivery from cargo aircraft using para-pack delivery capabilities is also a possibility.  Delivery from submarine platforms is desirable. Initial Increment Capabilities ·	Be placed in water depths of 150 feet and deeper ·	Real time autonomous detection and classification of surface ships and submarines with near zero false alarms  ·	Engagement of targets with a high probability of inflicting mission abort damage  ·	In-water life > 180 days; Active life > 90 days ·	2-way communications between each weapon and the maritime commander to enable command activation, temporary deactivation, detonation, sterilization and/or recovery ·	Deployable from air and surface platforms ·	Modularity to enable multiple mission reconfigurations and future upgrades Future increments could provide increasing capabilities such as: ·	Providing for delivery by submarine or other clandestine means. ·	Expanding the threat target set. ·	Delivery into hostile environments from long standoff ranges in excess of 200 miles.  It is envisioned this would be accomplished with unmanned systems, including Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). ·	Integration into distributed surveillance sensor networks to provide improved targeting through data fusion, cooperative engagement with other kill mechanisms, and high quality target track and classification to improve situational awareness and to provide damage assessments.  Process.  Industry is encouraged to submit information to PEO LMW (PMS495).  The following items are provided for guidance only in submitting input.  Information shall be submitted to PEO LMW (PMS495) via email to minesrfi@sirius.navsea.navy.mil.  All responses are due by 30 April 2005.  The government is interested in unclassified information only. In the event that industry provides information to the government that it does not want disclosed to the public, it shall mark the title page with the following legend:  ”This document includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed -- in whole or in part -- for any purpose other than to provide information to the government.  This restriction does not limit the Government’s right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. This is Amendment 0001 to the synopsis N00178-05-Q-2050 to answer questions that were received from industry.  Questions regarding CMMI Support Documentation Solicitation, and will modify it as follows: This procurement is a 100 percent set-aside for small business.  a. Question: How many software development projects are involved with this project? Answer:  There are three (3) software projects CAALTS, ASM and Aegis Intranet. ASM and Aegis Intranet are large projects in scope and CAALTS is medium in s! cope. All three projects have the same software processes identified. b. Question: Do the projects share a common architecture? Answer:  Yes. c. Question:  How many people are working on these projects? Answer:  There are 15 people on the CAALTS project, the ASM project has 16 people, and there are 10 people on the Aegis Intranet project. d. Question: What is the number of people in the organization being assessed? Answer:  There are approximately 25 individuals who will be assessed.  e.  Question: Is there any previous CMM or CMMI assessment history? Answer:  Yes, a CMM Level Rating held August 16-25, 2004.f.  Question:  Is there any previous CMM or CMMI training? Answer:  Yes.  CMM Overview conducted on 26 and 27 February 2004.  Understanding the CMMI conducted by the Software Productivity Consortium 3-4 December 2003.  Introduction to the CMMI, Staged Representation, conducted by the SEI held 1-3 December 2004.  Mastering Process Improvement, conducted by the SEI held 13-! 17 December 2004.  CMMI Overview conducted 10 and 11 January 2005 and 8 and 9 February 2005. g.  Question:  Is the organization located in multiple locations?  How many? Answer:  Development for two projects is done in-house/on-site.  Development work for the Aegis Intranet is done off-site.  Supplier Agreement Management (SAM) would apply for this project. h.  Question: Is the assessment for Software, Software and Systems Engineering, or IPP? Answer:  The Assessment is for Software only. i.  Question:  If an organization is just getting started, it typically takes 12 to 18 months to reach CMMI Level 2, and an additional 12 to 18 months to reach CMMI Level 3. Unless this organization is ready for the Level 2 assessment next month, it will be impossible to complete both the Level 2 and the Level 3 assessments by September, 2006. Answer:  The organization is well versed in CMM. The CMM effort started in February 2003 and the CMMI effort started in September 2004.  There was mo! re progress seen after the formal CMMI Training held in December 2004. j.  Question:  No consultant can guarantee that an organization will successfully pass a CMMI appraisal within a timeframe.  The actual burden for the work falls on the internal process improvement group for that organization - which ideally consists of 3 percent to 5 percent of the staff, working at least part time.  Is NSWCDD willing to create a process improvement group, and staff it at the necessary level for this effort? Answer:  A process improvement group already exists. k.  Question:  I would like to request a clarification for the "Mandatory Requirements" paragraph in the SOW.  The way it currently reads, it is unclear whether the offeror needs to be authorized by the CMMI, or if the offeror's consultant needs to be authorized by the CMMI.  Answer:  The mandatory requirement is for the offeror to be certified by SEI.  This equates to an offeror having a Lead Appraiser who is authorized by the SEI!  to conduct a SCAMPI appraisal and provide CMMI services, if needed.  l.  Question: Some consultants are authorized by the SEI to provide SCAMPI for SW-CMM assessments, however, this does not mean that they are authorized to provide SCAMPI for CMMI appraisals. Also, the SEI now requires that consultants be separately authorized to teach "Intro to CMMI". Since this course is mandatory for members of the assessment team conducting a SCAMPI "A", unless it is being separately bid, it should be included in the quote. Answer:  CMM Based Appraisal for Internal Process Improvement (CBA-IPI) was for SW-CMM.  This has been replaced by Standard CMMI Assessment Method for Process Improvement (SCAMPI) for CMMI. If a consultant is authorized to do a SCAMPI appraisal then it would be for CMMI.  CBA IPI has different requirements. Yes, SCAMPI requires that the assessment team have formal Introduction to CMMI training by the SEI and N82 currently has two people who meet this requirement.  m.!   Question: Is a security clearance required? Answer:  There are no security clearance requirements. n.  Question: The size of each project to be appraised? Answer:  Using code size to determine the project; CAALTS is Medium, ASM and Aegis Intranet are large projects. o.  Question: Please clarify how much review and comment is required for each of these documents?  Answer:  Approximately 28 hours total for the review and discussion of the plans (items a, b, c, and d.) p.  Question: Is developing and presenting a Power Point presentation acceptable as a report?  Answer:  Yes, This is the development of findings - report and it is O. K. to brief out in presentation format. q.  Question: In order to meet the objectives to the SCAMPI, is there any flexibility of foregoing the interviews of projects managers and practitioners and replace it with a few representative mock-interviews for the deliverable. Answer:  No.  Mock interviews are "practice" or like a "dress rehearsal". We n! eed interviews to be conducted as "full blown" during the Pre-Assessment, as the Final SCAMPI rating is the appraisal with deltas between the two sessions (e.g. Pre-assessment and Rating). r.  Question:  Will the same individuals who will make up the Appraisal Team for the pre-assessment be the same individuals who will make up the Appraisal Team for the SCAMPI appraisal? Answer:  Yes.  s.  Question: The $45K funding, does it include travel expenses or the travel expenses are in addition to the $45K? Answer:  The entire task, including any travel can not exceed $45,000.00. This procurement will be acquired utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13 and is limited to Small Businesses.  The closing date will be April 19, 2005 with an anticipated award date of 6 May 2005.  All items will be priced FOB-Destination, Dahlgren, Virginia.

<CONTACT>Deborah Green, Contract Specialist, Phone 805-982-2680, Fax 805-982-4540, Email deborah.green@navy.mil
<DESC>The Geothermal Program Office (GPO) of the U.S. Navy is seeking an independent analysis of the hydrogeology of the area known as the Coso Hot Springs, located in the Coso Range, Naval Air Weapons Station, China Lake, CA.  The Coso Geothermal Area has been the subject of both occasional and intensive study over the past 90 years, but no compelling hydrogeologic model has emerged that clearly explains the relationship between major surface thermal features and the deep geothermal resource that is being used to generate electricity in nearby power plants.  Specifically the study shall describe any influence on Coso Hot Springs from activities related to geothermal power production in the adjacent Coso Geothermal Field.  The work performed under this contract will attempt to provide a comprehensive model that: explains the occurrence and movement of subterranean waters; the mechanical, chemical, and thermal interaction of this water with the porous and permeable medium; and the transport of energy and chemical constituents related thereto.  As described in the edited list of relevant publications provided in this solicitation, there are numerous data sets available for the area including more than 20 years of monitoring reports, compiled and interpreted by personnel of the U.S. Navy Geothermal Program Office, its contractors, and independent scientific investigators.  These resources will be made available to the successful offeror to utilize in completing the work.  The study must address all aspects of the Coso Range hydrologic environment including the non-geothermal, high-desert hydrogeology, both shallow local and deep regional hydrology, as well as the geothermal elements of the overlying Coso geothermal field.  As appropriate, and required to, acknowledge the importance of the neotectonic setting in which the Coso Hot Springs is located, the proposal shall incorporate known structural and tectonic findings into the hydrogeology model.  This study must be completed in one year or less from date of contract award, and the required products will be: (1) A technical report fully documenting the detailed hydrogeologic model as well as all analyses, syntheses, assumptions and processes that contributed to the model.  (2) A less-technically oriented summary report that shall be written and illustrated such that the scientific processes, modeling and conclusions of the study can be readily understood by the general public.  PROPOSAL EVALUATION - A team of Navy technical experts in the geosciences will conduct the evaluations of all proposals, and make recommendations to the source selection authority for contract award.  - The criteria listed below will be the basis for proposal evaluation and selection.  Overall scientific and technical merit of the proposed work is substantially more important than the other criteria.  All other criteria are of equal importance.  Price will be a factor in determining contract award, but it will not be the sole criterion.  The Navy intends to award a contract to the proposal that offers the best value: Scientific and technical merit of the work proposed.  Demonstrated understanding of, and familiarity with, hydrothermal systems.  Capabilities and related experience of key personnel in the technical areas being proposed, foremost of which is hydrogeology; realism and reasonableness of the proposed costs.  All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to Deborah Green, Contract Specialist, deborah.green@navy.mil  The purpose of this amendment is to add the following: The solicitation will be posted at the following Internet address http://esol.navfac.navy.mil and to change the following: the date for posting will be on or about 22 April 2005.  In accordance with FAR 5.102 this solicitation will only be available electronically.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to (1) Revise Block 11 of Standard Form 30 of Solicitation W15QKN-04-R-0101: the solicitation closing date of 3:00PM  EST, 18 April 2005 is being extended to 3:00PM EST, 25 April 2005.  (2) Section D, Paragraph D.1.1 of solicitation W15QKN-04-R-0101 is revised  as follows: From: D.1.1 UNITIZATION :  Unitization shall be in accordance  with:  Use USADAC AMC Dwg. 19-48-4116/125B-20PA1002 located on the web  at https://www3.dac.army.mil/DET/capuldi/capuldi.html  To: D.1.1  UNITIZATION:  Unitization shall be in accordance with: USADAC AMC Dwg.  19-48-4116/125B-20PA1002 (THIS DOCUMENT IS IN DRAFT FORM AND SUBJECT TO   REVISION). (3) Section J, Paragraph J.1 of solicitation W15QKN-04-R-0101:   Attachment # 14 is hereby incorporated into the solicitation: Attachment  14: Unitization Procedures For Boxed Ammunition And Components on 4-Way  Entry Pallets Dwg. 19-48-4116/125B-20PA1002, dated April 2005, pages: 3.  (4) Provide the following answers to questions received in response to  solicitation W15QKN-04-R-0101: Question # 1:  We recognize the need and  are registered in the ORCA system, which of course is representative of  section K reps and certs. Do we also need to submit hard copies of section  K and those reps and certs if we are registered?  Answer:  The ORCA  requirement is not applicable to this solicitation.  Paper copies should  be provided. Question #2: We have been to the DAC website shown on page 11   titled Unitization and cannot find the referenced drawing for the  unitization of the E1 variant. The question then remains how many kits to  a pallet? Answer: Unitization shall be in accordance with USADAC AMC  Dwg. 19-48-4116/125B-20PA1002.  An electronic copy of this document, in  its draft form is attached to this amendment.  This document is normally   located on the web at https://www3.dac.army.mil/DET/capbuldi/capuldi.html.    Since this document is only available in a draft form, it cannot be found  on the normal website for USADAC AMC drawings.  Question # 3: ARDEC paid  for metal parts tooling in order to demonstrate the construction of the  metal parts for the E1 variant. This tooling is not the same as the modified  seamer in question earlier (resident at ARDEC). The tooling was paid for  under a services contract and should be government owned. Is this tooling   available to other contractors?  Answer:  The government would like to  clarify that the equipment addressed in the question is not being offered  as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) in this solicitation. (5) All  other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

9.	JOB DESCRIPTION/STATEMENT OF WORK:  See following text.  
 
SCOPE OF WORK

1.	BASIC FUNCTION OF POSITION:

This position is located in the Economic Growth Office, USAID/Morocco.  The Senior Private Sector Program Manager will provide technical and managerial leadership and advice for the design, management, monitoring and evaluation of a portfolio of programs, projects, and activities in support of economic growth and job creation, and the successful implementation of the Free Trade Agreement between the United States and Morocco.  He/she will serve as a senior member of USAID/Morocco’s Economic Growth Team and will report to the EG Team Leader.  He/she will advise the Team on all aspects of the EG portfolio and will play an important role in staff development and mentoring.  He/she will also manage selected programs, in particular those that cut across and support all three intermediate results under the Strategic Objective.

2.	BACKGROUND:

The implementation of trade liberalization in Morocco will lead to major transformations in agriculture and the rural economy.  The eventual elimination of tariffs will result in lower margins and reduced production of certain cereal crops, notably wheat and oil seeds.  Offsetting these rural income and employment losses will require a shift toward higher value-added production and the creation of new businesses and job opportunities in both rural areas and smaller towns and cities.

Although Morocco has made great strides in improving its overall business environment, particularly in the areas of macroeconomic stability, infrastructure development, and customs clearance, it continues to lag behind its competitors in simplifying investment procedures, developing its workforce, and ensuring access to finance for the small businesses that make up 80 percent of the economy.   

Substantial progress has been made in commercial law reform, easing new business registration processes, and improving the competence of the separate judiciary that now treats commercial law cases. However, lack of transparency, incertitude about the outcome of legal processes, and a perception that similar cases are not treated equally still discourage investment, and impede the development of bank finance. Further reform is required to provide greater surety to investors, both foreign and domestic. 

Morocco has also implemented a major program of financial reform, but banks are still highly liquid, heavily invested in Moroccan treasury issues, and prospect little beyond their customary, well established clients.  Small businesses are underserved; private financing for municipal infrastructure that would facilitate private business development is virtually non-existent.

Financial markets development is hampered by unreliable and inadequate information about the financial health of potential borrowers, underdeveloped and expensive procedures for the perfection of liens on moveable and real property, and unpredictable bankruptcy proceedings.  The market for agricultural credit is dominated by a single, majority state-owned institution which has a high percentage of non-performing loans.  Although it has been the subject of reform efforts, this institution alone is unable to meet the future capital requirements of a dynamic agriculture sector.  Commercial banks provide credit for agribusinesses, but to this date have not seriously ventured into the more risky agriculture credits, except for major, well-known private clients.
USAID economic growth strategy is to assist Morocco in successfully responding to the challenges and opportunities of the more liberalized trading environment that will be brought about by the Free Trade Agreement with the US., the Association Agreement with the European Union, and Morocco’s own reform efforts.  There are three intermediate results (IRs) which are key to achieving this objective:

1.	 Increased productivity in agriculture and agribusiness

2.	 Creation of new business opportunities outside of agriculture and agribusiness

3.	 An improved business environment.

<CONTACT>ANITA NORRIS (703) 432-4181
<DESC>INFORMATION EXCHANGE, NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.  Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), Fire Support Systems (FSS) Marine Corps. Mission objective:  To identify current or near-term precision Non-Magnetic Azimuth Sensor solutions available to the Marine Corps and provide an informational briefing and exchange to vendors/government agencies to clarify performance requirements and acquisition timelines.  Current capabilities and limitations:  Forward Observers, Forward Air Controllers, and Reconnaissance Units employ the Common Laser Rangefinder (CLRF) System to aid in the determination of accurate target location.  The CLRF System consists of the Vector 21B, Defense Advance GPS Receiver (DAGR), tripod, AN/PVS-14 Night Vision Device, and Binocular Optical Magnification Enhancement. The Vector 21B use an eye-safe laser and an internal digital magnetic compass (DMC) to determine range, azimuth, and vertical angle from the user’s location to the target location.  These measurements are then transmitted to the DAGR using targeting software via a RS-232 interface cable.  Once received at the DAGR, the operator is able to determine target location with respect to a 10 digit grid coordinate system.  Operation in the vicinity of vehicles, buildings, equipment and hostile magnetic environments is extremely restrictive due to the effects of magnetic fields on the DMC.   Technical solution for improved capabilities:  A Non-Magnetic Azimuth Sensor solution is necessary to augment, or replace, the DMC in existing laser rangefinders in all-weather environments and operate successfully in man portable or land mobile configurations regardless of magnetic variations. Capabilities needed include system capability to communicate with the DAGR and Vector 21B, provide a method for permanent boresighting with Vector 21B, and cue the operator when compensation is required. Optional capabilities include automatic compensation, and visual display of target location data.   This technical solution may include alternative solutions to the current CLRF system ancillary equipment in order to achieve the system weight requirement.  The solution must be capable of meeting the performance specifications without the use of multiple GPS antennas.  Design goals should emphasize azimuth angle accuracy.   Known Performance Requirements:  The Marine Corps seeks COTS/GOTS solutions readily available for demonstration before the end of FY05.  Solutions must be able to address minimum performance requirements:  interoperable communication protocol that permits data passage to/from existing Marine Corps Vector 21B Laser Rangefinders and DAGR systems; achieve an azimuth accuracy of 8 mils (one sigma)  in 1minutes and 4 mils (one sigma) after 4 minutes (threshold); the solution can only add 2.0 lbs to existing CLRF system; maintain accuracy during operation; preserve accuracy when system is disturbed (such as bumping or repositioning the system within 5 meters); maintain bore sight with rangefinder; operation between the 0° and 75° latitude; operable by personnel in full range of military protective clothing; operate over temperature ranges of –35 °C to 63 °C (-31 °F to 145 °F); expected to meet Nuclear/Biological/Chemical (NBC) criteria for decontamination, hardness and compatibili! ty; performance shall not be degraded by or be the source of electronic interference due to electromagnetic environmental effects (E3); and performance shall not be degraded by environmental effects (e.g., vibration, drop shock, atmospheric, water submersion, fungus, sand and dust, salt fog, or solar radiation). Vendors/government agencies capable of meeting the above requirements, whole or in part, are invited to a Vendor Informational Briefing and Exchange in the Quantico, VA area to discuss performance requirements and acquisition timelines on 25 May 2005. Exact location will depend on number of responses and attendees.  Further information will be distributed to confirmed attendees.  Vendors/government agencies should submit Information Packages to include:  1) Names of representatives that will attend the Vendor Informational Briefing and Exchange on 25 May 2005;  2) Marketing and Technical information such as literature, brochures, and capabilities summaries directly addressing the responders’ abilities to meet the requirements identified and should also include technical sheets with graphics, environmental reports, reliability data, and any previous or existing government contract(s) for this specific type equipment. Interested vendors/government agencies are requested to respond NLT 9 May 2005, stating their business size, SIC Code, and a business point of contact.  Interested sources should respond to: (U.S. Mail address) Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command, ATTN CTQ6-AN, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134-6050  (Email)  anita.norris@usmc.mil (Fax) (703) 432-3550.  ANY SUBMISSION TO THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE MARINE CORPS TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES OR PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION RECEIVED.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), located in Miami, FL, intends to acquire sea turtle tag distribution and data management for the Cooperative Marine Turtle Tagging Program (CMTTP) on a sole-source basis from the University of Florida, Archie Carr Center for Sea Turtle Research (ACCSTR), located in Gainesville, FL, for the following reasons. Mark-recapture data is used to understand animal movements; to estimate growth, demographic parameters and vital rates; and to estimate population size--all needed in support of stock assessments. The CMTTP was established to distribute tags, to provide a clearinghouse for data on all flipper tags, to prevent duplication of tags, to facilitate exchange of tag data among researchers, and to archive and collate data on all tag series.  In response to those needs, the CMTTP has catalogued all NMFS Atlantic tagging data and assists programs worldwide in the exchange and dissemination of tag data and tag-related information.  Protocols for the distribution and application of CMTTP tags and policies regarding tag ownership and the use of tag data have been developed at http://accstr.ufl.edu/cmttp.htm1.  All data submitted are archived as hard copy as well as computer electronic files. The purpose of this contract is to continue the NMFS effort for the consolidated tag distribution center and for the database. The CMTTP was maintained at the NMFS beginning in 1980, at which time there were several entities purchasing, distributing, and applying tags to sea turtles. In April 1999, consolidation took place between the NMFS Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) and the ACCSTR transferring NMFS’ CMTTP management to the ACCSTR. This served to eliminate the duplication of necessary infrastructure, thus saving federal dollars, and to minimize the duplication of tag identification numbers among programs and the confusion associated with returning recovered tags to two separate entities. The objectives of this effort are as follows: 1) Centralize the tagging records for all sea turtle tagging activities in the western North Atlantic; 2) Facilitate the distribution of sea turtle tags throughout the western North Atlantic; 3) Improve the ability of managers to recover sea turtle populations by providing access to the databases; and 4) Maintain a webpage for the CMTTP. Description of Work: 1) Purchase and distribute tags (#681 Inconel) and applicators; 2) Recover cost of tags and applicators from organizations requesting tags, when possible; 3) Maintain database for tag distribution records and webpage for tag distribution inventory; 4) Archive, as hard copy, all tagging data submitted by the cooperating tagging programs; 5) Maintain the databases for tag releases; 6) Maintain the databases of recovered records from recaptured turtles, 7) Continue to reorganize and improve database structure to facilitate use by NMFS SEFSC; 8) Disseminate data to “data owners” (per CMTTP policy), as requested; 9) Facilitate the sharing of tagging information among researchers; 10) Provide NMFS SEFSC with access to the databases and e-mail NMFS SEFSC updated database files, upon request; 11) Maintain the CMTTP webpage [http://accstr.ufl.edu/cmttp.html]; and 12) Provide an annual summary of activities. The anticipated performance period is date of award through April 30, 2006. The proposed contract actions is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.

DESCRIPTION

Introduction:  The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Office of Consular Affairs (CA) intends to solicit proposals from industry to establish one or more ?user-pays?, contractor-provided and operated Visa Information Centers to respond to inquiries by the general public for information on consular matters and to provide certain visa related services as defined in the attached draft Statement of Work.  Initially, the Center(s) will serve callers from the Mission China?s service area, Hong Kong and its vicinity.  Additional service centers may be established later on to serve countries in the East Asia and Pacific region. 

The term ?user-pays? means that the caller will be responsible for paying the Contractor directly for the services rendered, such as, automated information, live operator assistance, fax-on-demand services, etc.  This means no U.S. Government appropriated funds will be made available or utilized in the performance of this contract. The Contractor shall provide the required personnel, facilities, technology, supplies, and services to operate, maintain and manage the Center(s) and to collect the appropriate service fees from the callers to cover all costs incurred to deliver the services requested by the U.S. Government.   The service fees to be paid by the callers will be based on a price schedule approved by the U.S. Government.  Certain portion of the service fees collected by the Contractor will be used to fund Special Related Services (SRS) to enhance the level of service to recipients of consular services and to assist in setting up other center(s) to serve countries in the East Asia and Pacific region.  The Contractor may use different payment methods for collecting the applicable service fees from the callers, including the use of ?900? type ?user-pays? telephone services, credit cards, prepaid telephone calling cards, bank payments, etc.  

Purpose:  To obtain comments from industry regarding industry?s understanding of the requirements as defined in the draft Statement of Work,  implementation strategies and approaches for meeting these requirements within the defined service areas, and payment collection methods for services rendered.  The Department of State intends to use industry?s comments to finalize the Statement of Work for release through pre-solicitation conference or notice.  NO AWARD WILL BE MADE AS A RESULT OF THIS RFI.  NO PAYMENT WILL BE MADE FOR INFORMATION SUBMITTED.

Information Requested from Industry:  Interested parties are encouraged to submit comments on the Draft Statement of Work.  Specific comments are requested on the following questions:  

1. Are ?800? and ?900? type services available in each of the service areas defined in the draft Statement of Work?  If so, are the services accessible from all callers within each of those service areas?  
2. Will it be possible to implement a single ?800? and ?900? number solution to serve callers from Mainland China, Hong Kong and vicinity?  If so, what is the cost impact of such a solution?
3. What effective payment methods and implementation strategies are commonly used for collecting payment for ?user-pays? information services, such as those defined in the draft Statement of Work, including attended and unattended services for voice and fax services, and for responding to e-mail requests for information and support?
What technology is available to enable callers with dial pulse telephones to obtain services via the unattended mode and the incremental costs for implementing such technology over that used for providing unattended services to callers with touch tone telephones?

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify potential small businesses for the following requirements.  This is not a pre-solicitation notice. The Department is under no obligation to provide any follow-up information and/or responses. The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is required, in accordance with HUD regulations, to annually assess each public housing agency's (PHA) performance under the Section Eight Management Assessment Program (SEMAP) and to assign annual SEMAP scores and performance ratings.  When a PHA has been assigned an overall rating of troubled, HUD Field Offices must conduct an on-site review of the PHA's Housing Choice Voucher program management in order to assess the magnitude and seriousness of the PHA's non-compliance with HUD regulations and/or SEMAP performance requirements.  In addition, the Troubled PHA, and in some cases a near-troubled PHA, must develop a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) for HUD review and approval and HUD must continue to monitor the PHA's progress to ensure the performance targets contained in the CAP are met and that the PHA will be able to attain a satisfactory SEMAP rating by the third SEMAP reporting cycle.  In accomplishing these tasks, HUD field offices may utilize the services of contractors to conduct on-site reviews of PHAs that have been designated troubled, near-troubled, or non-troubled but have significant management and operational deficiencies that result in systemic deficiencies, issues, or failures under the Housing Choice Voucher program. 

HUD may require contractor services to conduct independent assessments of the PHA Housing Choice Voucher programs under SEMAP.  The scope of the assessments shall include the deficiencies cited in the most recent SEMAP scoring report, as well as specific deficiencies noted in Field conducted Management Reviews, Confirmatory Reviews, Independent Auditor Reports, and OIG Audit Reports that impact Section 8 program operations, activities, and administration.  HUD also requires assistance in order to assist the SEMAP troubled PHA in the development of a SEMAP Corrective Action Plan pursuant to 24 CFR, Part 985.107, and to provide appropriate technical assistance to resolve SEMAP and other related program deficiencies.  Some or all of this work may be accomplished using contractors. 

The nature of the deficiencies may include, but not be limited to, an inability to properly manage and administer the PHA's waiting list, an applicant's income and eligibility for program participation, rent reasonableness of units, HQS inspections of units, and HQS enforcement.  Other deficiencies may include program accounting, project-based and special needs assistance, family self-sufficiency programs, and program marketing.  It is anticipated that these services will be solicited under NAICS Code 541990.  

Interested firms that wish to be identified as potential sources for this requirement should provide a ONE-PAGE capability statement that provides a narrative description of the contractor's past experience and knowledge regarding the Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP), familiarity with the Section Eight Management Assessment Program (SEMAP), and any language or multiple language capabilities.  The capability statement must be all text (no pictures, no diagrams, etc.), and must be in a Microsoft Word document using Times New Roman 10 pt font.  Please include the most recent and current information available regarding your business. Please ensure that your one-page submission contains the following information: Name or Organization, Business Address (including website, if available), Point of Contact name, telephone numbers (both office and fax), and e-mail address.  You should also indicate the classification of your firm: Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Woman-Owned (other than small business), HUBZone Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, or 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business and include whether you are on a GSA schedule, and if so, identify the schedule number and provide a copy of your GSA contract and negotiated rates. This can be submitted in an Adobe PDF file if necessary (although Microsoft Word is preferred).  Provide your notice of interest and the one-page description of your capabilities via e-mail by close of business 5/16/05 to Ms. Paula Perkins at Paula_D._Perkins@hud.gov.

No fax, mailed, or hand delivered submissions will be accepted.  

NOTE: 

This is NOT a pre-solicitation notice.  The Department is under no obligation to provide any follow-up information and/or responses.

Firms currently approved, as SEMAP contractors will also need to resubmit their information as instructed above in order to recertify and to maintain their eligibility as SEMAP contractors.

All interested vendors must register (or currently be registered) on the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) website at http://www.bpn.gov.  Additionally, on the same CCR site, vendors must complete the vendor portion of the on-line representation and certifications (ORCA).

<DESC>Description NASA Langley Research Center is seeking University and Industry partners to develop technology proposals in response to the announcement below.  Synopsis: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) released addendum A.28 “The Advance Component Technology (ACT)” under the Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) NRA on January 28, 2005.   The objectives of the ACT Program are to research, develop, and demonstrate component  and subsystem level technology that: (1) Reduce the risk, cost, size, and development time for the Earth-Sun System Division (ESSD) observing instrument and platforms, and (2) Enable new ESSD observation measurements. The program brings instrument and platform components to a maturity level that allows their integration into other NASA technology development programs such as the Instrument Incubator Program (IIP) (See http://esto.gsfc.nasa.gov/obs_technologies.html.)  Some components are directly infused into mission designs by NASA flight projects. Other components "graduate" to other technology development programs for further advancement. Within this development environment, the ACT Program can rely upon other NASA and external technology programs for very low technology readiness and complementary advanced instrument components and subsystems, and the IIP for technology infusion opportunities. The ACT addendum (A.28) under the ROSES NRA solicits in situ measurements, highly compact and low power instrument electronics, detector array devices, active and passive microwave antennas, active electronics for Earth Science instruments (example: large aperture Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)), and passive electronics for Earth Science instruments (example: low mass/power radiometers).   NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) to develop and execute proposals in the specific areas defined below.  It is expected that selection of the proposal(s) and availability of funds would result in component development contract(s) for the selected partner(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA.  Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide component technology consistent with the efforts synopsized for each intended LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance:  (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability, and availability of key personnel. This criterion evaluates the proposers’ relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control. This criterion evaluates the proposers' ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area.  (3) Facilities.

The specific technical requirements and NASA LaRC point of contact for technical questions are provided below:  1. Avalanche Photodiode (APD) FPA Development for DIAL and Ranging Applications  Technical Point of Contact: Dr. M. Nurul Abedin, (757) 864-4814, email address N.Abedin@larc.nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is assembling a spread system to demonstrate a DIAL/Laser Range Detection instrument in the laboratory.  The spread system will be designed to test instrument concepts and technology in preparation for the development of a flight instrument. This DIAL/Ranging instrument requires an advanced avalanche photodiode to operate at moderate temperatures and over a large detection area for long-term lidar remote sensing at 0.8 &#61549;m to 5 &#61549;m wavelength range.  The development of an avalanche photodiode will enhance the capabilities to study aerosols, clouds, trace gases, greenhouse gases, surface topography, biomass, winds, atmospheric pollutants monitoring (CO, etc.), and detection of a large number of species in the near and mid-IR using active remote sensing techniques.  NASA Langley Research Center is looking for potential partners to develop a large format avalanche photodiode with a 5 &#956;m cutoff wavelength. Establish the highest responsivity such that the desired device will meet the minimum requirements shown below: i.	Collecting Area for each Element ~ 64x64 &#956;m^2, ii.	Bandwidth ³ 500 MHz, iii.	Noiseless gain, iv.	Quantum efficiency ³ 70%, and  v.	Noise equivalent power &#61603;10 -14 W/ÖHz. 2. Phototransistor Focal Plane Arrays For the 0.6- to 2.5-mm Wavelength Range Technical Point of Contact: Dr. M. Nurul Abedin, (757) 864-4814, email address N.Abedin@larc.nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is looking for potential partners to develop high performance broadband one-dimensional (1x512 elements) to two-dimensional (up to 512x512 elements) arrays in the 0.6- to 2.5-&#61549;m wavelength range. The proposed broadband FPA will be tested in the laboratory breadboard and will be used in the next generation Mars Orbiter and other planetary instruments with substantial reduction in size, complexity, and weight to measure water vapor, methane, and carbon dioxide in planetary atmospheres as well as aerosol, cloud, water vapor, N2O, CO2, and O3 for predictions of climate and weather for the Earth and Space Science Missions. Development of 1-D and 2-D arrays will enhance the capability for active and passive remote sensing imaging systems and also enable major advances in lightweight, compact Earth and planetary remote sensing instruments. The proposed goal of this study is to develop high performance Focal Plane Array devices such that the desired device will meet the following steps: i.   Very high responsivity (1,000 Amp/Watt),  ii.  High operating temperature (-20oC), iii. Quantum efficiency ³ 60%, iv.  Noise equivalent power &#61603;10 -14 W/ÖHz, v.   Pixel size ~ 25x25 µm2, and vi.  Focal Plane Arrays: 1-D (1x512 elements) and 2-D (512x512 elements). 3.  Powering Electronics via Fiber Optical Interconnect Technical Point of Contact: Kevin M. Somervill, 757-864-6570, kevin.m.somervill@nasa.gov NASA Langley Research Center is actively planning and researching the potential to transmit useable power across standard fiber core optical cable for use in space based satellites. The Center envisions a technology study of current components and the development of prototype demonstration hardware.  Specifically, NASA would like to develop technology demonstration hardware to concurrently transmit power and data communications via a single multi-channel interface.  The Center is therefore seeking partners with which to develop power transmission and collection circuitry to be incorporated into existing technology as a monolithic device.  The particular requirements include a fiber optic transceiver baseline with the following characteristics: i.   Operational frequency of at least 2Gb/s per channel ii.  Four, or more, independent transceiver channels iii. Support standard 50/125, 62.5/125, and 100/140 multimode fiber iv.  Radiation tolerant with TID 100Krad v.   SEU &gt; 20-MeV-cm2/mg

<SUBJECT>67--High Resolution Digital Orthoimagery and Digital Elevation Data for Alaska
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION Acquisition of High Resolution Digital Orthoimagery and Digital Elevation Data for Alaska This is a Request For Information (RFI) only.  It is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  Although information gained from this Request for Information (RFI) may be used to secure funding and initiate mapping contracts, the government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information. The government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. I.  Area of Interest: The Alaska mapping community, represented by the Alaska Geographic Data Committee (AGDC), through the US Geological Survey (USGS), is requesting product, cost, and delivery information for statewide ortho-imagery coverage, statewide digital elevation models; and higher resolution ortho-imagery and elevation models for selected areas of interest.   II.  Responses:   A.  Respondents should submit the RFI information specified in Paragraph IV, Proposed Minimum Specifications, and each subparagraph entitled "deliverables" for Statewide Ortho-imagery project; Statewide DEM;  and Special Interest area ortho-imagery and DEM products.  Respondents may also present several alternative solutions provided they meet or exceed the minimum specifications and satisfy the broad goals of consistent statewide coverage and local higher resolution coverage for the defined areas of interest.  Responses should be limited to 20 pages exclusive of commercial printed brochures. B.  Estimates for ortho-imagery and elevation modeling must be kept separate.  Leveraging of existing imagery to lower total project cost is permitted.  The USGS is also soliciting information to determine the availability of capable contractors that can provide this data.   III.  BACKGROUND The AGDC believes reliable, current, statewide base geographic information is essential for continued economic development, livability, and public safety.  Orthoimagery and elevation data are considered the foundation for the framework of base geographic data.  At this time, Alaska does not have digital orthoimagery or accurate elevation data.  U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) maps of Alaska are over 40 years old, do not meet national Map Accuracy Standards, and there is no existing or planned program to replace them.  The most recent statewide high resolution imagery available is 25 years old and does not reflect the current Alaska landscape, especially in light of recent earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and coastal shoreline erosion.  This imagery was acquired through the Alaska High Altitude Aerial Photography Program and is not in digital form, a prerequisite for modern technology.  New orthoimagery and elevation data would provide common data foundation layers that would show current conditions and trends over the Alaska landscape and allow other types of geographic information to be extracted and registered.  These data layers will allow Alaska agencies, Native corporations, and private organizations to better utilize GIS technology to aid in responsible decision making.   Because of the vast amount of undeveloped land area in Alaska, two sets of proposed minimum specifications are provided - one for Statewide coverage and a second for Special Interest Areas. The Government anticipates that any data acquisition program developed will provide for statewide coverage of the products within five years of the start of the acquisition.   IV.  PROPOSED MINIMUM SPECIFICATIONS: A. 1  Statewide Ortho-imagery Specifications "	Statewide coverage "	Quad boundary (1:250,000) "	6 meter resolution or better, allowing for panchromatic sharpening at 2:1 "	Color infrared, true color, or multi-spectral (including IR) "	Meets National Map Accuracy Standards for 1:25000 scale "	7-bit data or better "	Less than 5% cloud and shadow cover per area within 15-minute quad boundary preferred.  It will be acceptable to replace clouds and shadows with images taken within the previous season and which meet specifications.  Will also consider 10% and 20% cloud and shadow cover. "	Leaf-on conditions "	Minimum sun angle 30 degrees "	View angle 15 degrees  "	Archive imagery within 2 years allowed "	Public domain licensing preferred, however, will consider noncommercial unrestricted licensing "	North American Datum 1983 "	Projection in Alaska Albers A.2   Ortho-imagery Deliverables: "	Digital ortho-imagery "	Seamless quad (1:250,000) format "	Raw data  "	Ephemeris data "	FGDC compliant metadata A.3  RFI Deliverables for Statewide Ortho-imagery Project "	Description of final product "	Estimated Annual Cost to Support Statewide Ortho Project; total project cost; cost per unit area for incremental funding "	Estimated Timeframe for delivery of raw data "	Estimated Timeframe for delivery of final products "	Optional: Data dissemination and management model within Open GIS Framework B.1 Statewide Digital Elevation Model (DEM) Specifications "	30 meter posting  "	30 meter circular accuracy "	10 meter vertical accuracy  "	Horizontal datum of NAD83  "	Vertical datum of NAVD88 B.2.

<SUBJECT>R -- JT&E Program Recompetition Information Meeting
<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC) Specialized Contracts Division at Eglin AFB FL invites all interested parties to attend a half day conference at Eglin AFB to discuss plans for the upcoming acquisition of the Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E) Engineering, Analysis and Test Support effort.  Conference is scheduled for 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on 25 May 2005 in Building 1, Room 204.  This competition is a follow-on effort which will be a vehicle for the Deputy Director, Air Warfare (AW), in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Director, Operational Test and Evaluation) (OSD(DOT&E)) to provide support to the Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E) Program.  The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) sponsors the JT&E Program to conduct tests and evaluations and provide information required by Congress, OSD, the Unified Commands, and Department of Defense (DOD) components relative to joint operations. Congress established the JT&E Program in 1972 after a Presidential Commission concluded that the DOD had no capability to conduct test and evaluation in a joint environment.  The JT&E process is composed of three separate but closely related activities:  (a) the nomination, coordination and consideration of the nomination for inclusion in the JT&E Program; (b) a Joint Feasibility Study (JFS) determination of the need and feasibility of approved nominations; and (c) the chartered joint tests (JT&E) which are the execution of these approved nominations that show potential for significant improvements in joint military capabilities.   This acquisition will support both the JFS and the JT&E part of this process.  Also supported are Quick Reaction Tests (QRT), which are short duration (approximately one year) tests in response to Warfighter emergent requirements, and Tests and Evaluation (T&E), which function like JT&E but do not involve joint capabilities.   The JT&E program requires technical and engineering support across the range of test activities to include the preparation of technical reports, test design and planning, field test activities, data collection, data processing and analysis, software development and documentation, hardware and software configuration, programming, analysis of system performance and related data, modeling and simulation, training, instrumentation and facilities, integrated logistic support, resource and program control, verification, validation and accreditation.  All contract work is currently being provided by task orders awarded through five indefinite delivery contracts.  The total cost for the five-year period on the current contracts, which ends 30 September 2006, is estimated to be $400 million.  A task order on each of the five indefinite delivery contracts currently provides program office support instrumental in the JFS/JT&E nomination/selection process.  Due to the appearance of possible conflict of interest issues, this program office support effort will be pursued as a completely separate acquisition.  The scheduled conference is intended to share additional information about the JT&E Program, to share preliminary acquisition plans, and to determine industry interest.  Those interested in attending the conference must forward a visit request to include names, dates of birth, and social security numbers to AAC/PKZ not later than 18 May 2005.  This should facilitate a smoother base entry.  Any specific questions or areas of interest you would like to have addressed should be submitted to AAC/PKZ not later than 18 May 2005.  The AAC/PKZ point of contact for this conference is Derek Beavers at (850) 882-0167, derek.beavers@eglin.af.mil.

<CONTACT>Richard E. Shriver Purchasing Agent 3032362001     richard.shriver@mms.gov; Mary J. Carver Contract Specialist 7037871340     Mary.Carver@mms.gov;
<DESC>Questions and Answers: 1.	Paragraph 6.1.3.11. "(It is expected that 30,000 polygons per frame, at 60Hz, is attainable.)  Is this a typographical error, and was it intended to be 300,000 polygons per frame at 60Hz?  Answer: This was not a typo.  We know it is a low number and most contemporary IGs are capable of much more, but we weren't sure what to put for a minimum acceptable performance level, 30,000 seemed a safe minimum. 2.	Paragraph 4.3.3: What is the significance of this paragraph? Answer: It was an oversight and should be ignored.  Integration tasks were covered in a broad way in the two preceding paragraphs. 3.	Paragraph 6.1.3.16: With respect to capture of video images, is this envisioned as a standard windows avi file, or by means of additional hardware to capture a video stream? Answer: This is not a requirement to capture video (not at this time).  It is meant to perform a screen capture to get a single image of the screen at 1-second intervals. This also applies to the next paragraph, 6.1.3.17. 4.	Paragraph 6.2.2.2.3: Sync on green is not standard on PC graphics cards. Is separate H and V sync acceptable?  If not, is an external box that provides sync-on-green acceptable? Answer: Yes, H and V sync is acceptable. 5.	Paragraph 6.2.3.9: With respect to paragraph 6.2.3.9, is their a map-size requirement for the referenced moving map capability?   What is the map resolution, i.e. 1:250?  Are the moving map displays centered on the current OTW eyepoint? Answer: The size of the texture map is as large as the hardware will allow (i.e. 1k by 1k,  2k by 2k, etc.) or smaller depending upon the scale/resolution of the particular map being displayed.  The scales/resolutions we are currently using are 1:2M, 1:1M, and 1:500K.  There are more but it is unlikely we'll use them.  Our current moving map capability is a proof of concept effort and only uses one map.  We'll be upgrading this to use multiple maps tiled on the display to provide a larger coverage of the database.  The greater the scale the lower the resolution is (i.e. for the 1:2M map the texture turned out to be 256x512 (when rounded up to the next larger power of 2) for a 1 degree by 1 degree area around Nellis AFB).  If we stay with the same coverage, 1 map over the 1x1 degree area, then we could want up to a total of 10 or so maps displayed at the same time.  Typically it'd probably be around 4 maps.  We are not going to cover the entire database with these maps, only selected areas. The moving maps are typically centered on the ownship or eyepoint.  However, there is a mode that the display can be zoomed in and centered over a pilot selected location. 6.	Paragraph 6.4.2: The SOW states:  "Other means of producing symbology (e.g. VAPS, DIST, others) will not be utilized at this time."  Does this include the use of I-Data? Answer: Correct, I-Data will not be used to produce symbology. 7.	Paragraph 6.4.6: Paragraph 6.4.6 references CIGI.  Is a particular CIGI revision required? Can other interface standards be used? Answer: CIGI is highly desired.  Version 2.0 is the minimum acceptable and 3.0 is preferred.  Other interface standards will be considered if they are indeed industry standards, de facto or otherwise. 8.	Paragraph 6.4.21: What is a hover lobe rendering? Answer:  This was a mistype.  It is not required nor supported.  Paragraph 6.4.21 should read, "Shall be capable of searchlight and landing lobe rendering" 9.	Paragraph 6.5: Are the Litening AT, Sniper,  and Mavrick sensors the same waveband? Answer:  Use long wave for all three. 10.	Paragraph 6.5.6: Are the plumes, referenced in paragraph 6.5.6, exhaust plumes from engines, missiles, etc. or is their some other intent? Answer: Yes, from exhaust plumes engines, missiles, etc. 11.	Paragraph 6.5.8: Please confirm that paragraph 6.5.8 does not imply that an independent fly-away eyepoint is required on the missile such that it must page data from a location separate from the launching aircraft.  Answer: It is intended that an independent flyaway eyepoint be used for a Maverik missile as a "nice to have" capability.  This will only make a difference if ALL other factors of the proposal are equal. 12.	Paragraph 6.11.2: Please clarify the required head tracker data.  Is the head tracker to adjust just the window attitude ( pitch and heading)?  What is envisioned as the required data? Answer: The HMD displays many of the same data that the HUD displays.  The host needs to know all 6 pieces if information from the head tracker, xyz and hpr. (As I understand it.  It could also be a point and two vectors.  In any case, where is the head and where is the pilot looking?)  This applies whether the host (initially) or the IG is rendering the HMD.  Further, the avionics code needs to know this info. We really haven't researched what data you get from a head tracker.  We just assume it's enough to provide location and orientation information, which is what we need. 13.       Paragraph 2 & 3: In several places in the solicitation (item 5 in Product Description of Solicitation, SOW para 2. Objectives and SOW para 3. Scope) it is stated "The existing AALCHEMY system will be traded in, with consideration, as part of this contract."  Please provide an inventory of items to be traded in, their purchase date, operational status, warranty status and estimated value such as to enable an offeror to place a value on the items to be traded in for consideration.  Answer: Inventory:                      One 4-channel AAlchemy 8264 rack mounted system which contains the following: "	4-dual 933 Mhz PIII, 256 MB, 3DFX graphics cards, 45 GB HD. "	2-800 Mhz PIII, 256 MB, with no graphics, 10 GB HD. Purchase date:              Early 2001 Operational status:         Operational.  Was used only briefly. Warranty status:            Expired. Estimated value:            Paid ~$90,000 for the hardware, new.
