<CONTACT>Louis P. Anderson, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-786-5564, Email Louis.Anderson@cms.hhs.gov - Christopher G Hagepanos, Contracting Officer, Phone 410-786-7598, Email Christopher.Hagepanos@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to issue a solicitation to procure an automated process to manage the plan-to-plan transfer of the Section 1860D-2 of the MMA requirement to track beneficiaries' "true out-of-pocket" (TrOOP) expenditures. The "TrOOP facilitation process" established by CMS to capture TrOOP-relevant data from Rx plans online and send this data to the relevant Part D Plan for TrOOP calculation offers the means by which the plan-to-plan TrOOP-related data transfer can be accomplished electronically.
<p>This pre-solicitation notice is hereby posted in accordance with FAR 5.2. CMS reserves the right and anticipates making a single contract award.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be issued in accordance with FAR Part 15. CMS plans to issue the solicitation as a full and open competition.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: <br />Section 1860D-2 of the MMA requires the tracking of beneficiaries' "true out-of-pocket" (TrOOP) expenditures. This section specifies the incurred costs that count toward TrOOP. Costs are treated as "incurred" only if they were paid by the individual (or by another person, such as a family member, on behalf of the individual), paid on behalf of a low-income subsidy-eligible individual under the &sect; 1860D-14 provisions, or paid under a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program (SPAP) as defined in &sect; 1860D-23. Costs do not count as "incurred" when: 1) no benefits are provided because of the application of either a formulary or the Medicare Secondary Payer rules, or 2) when costs are reimbursed "through insurance or otherwise, a group health plan, or other third party arrangement." Therefore, only certain costs not paid for by the Part D Plan count toward TrOOP. Section 1860D-2(a)(4)(D)(i) authorizes the CMS to establish procedures for a) determining whether costs for Part D enrollees are being reimbursed by excluded payers and b) alerting Part D Plans about the existence of such payers.<br />To calculate TrOOP, Medicare Part D Plans have to determine what other entities made payments on covered drugs. Section 1860D-23 requires the CMS to coordinate with SPAPs, and &sect; 1860D-24 requires that the CMS apply the same coordination requirements to "Rx plans" (as defined in that section). The CMS is establishing a "TrOOP facilitation process" that captures TrOOP-relevant data from SPAPs and Rx plans either online or in a batch process and sends it to the relevant Part D Plan for TrOOP calculation. Because of the &sect; 1860D-23 requirement, this process shall be performed for SPAP transactions even though the Part D Plan does not need to subtract SPAP payments from TrOOP.</p>
<p>Part D rules require plans to track the beneficiary's true out-of-pocket (TrOOP) costs and gross covered drug spending and correctly apply these costs to the TrOOP and benefit limits in order to correctly place the beneficiary in the benefit and provide the catastrophic level of coverage at the appropriate time. The TrOOP threshold and gross covered drug spending are calculated on an annual basis and must be transferred between Part D plans if a beneficiary dis-enroll and re-enrolls at any time before the end of the coverage year. The TrOOP-related data must also be transferred between Part D plans in those circumstances in which a Part D plan other than the plan of record paid for covered Part D drug costs as a primary payer and subsequently becomes aware; for example, through a CMS enrollment reconciliation process, that the beneficiary is enrolled in another Part D plan. <br />The anticipated award date of the contract is expected to be in early February, 2011.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The Government will not evaluate responses or accept phone calls in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC><br />The U.S. Department of Education (ED) is conducting Market Research. This REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) is being used to determine if sufficient interest and capability exists among all qualified vendors regarding the PRIVACY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER (PTAC).  This notice is provided as information to the marketplace to determine if there are vendors capable of performing the requirements in the attached &lsquo;Draft' Performance Work Statement (PWS) .  Information submitted in response to this RFI may be used as a basis for a future solicitation and/or as a basis for more in-depth research.
<p>ED's Institute of Education Sciences (IES), National Center for Education Evaluation (NCEE) anticipates the award of a firm fixed price contract for the PTAC that will be designed as a "one-stop" resource center for SEAs, LEAs, the postsecondary community, and other parties engaged in building and using education data bases.  The PTAC's role will be to provide timely and accurate information and guidance about data privacy, confidentiality, and security issues and practices in education and closely related fields; to disseminate this information to the field and the public; and to provide technical assistance to key stakeholders. <br />PTAC will serve as a "first response" resource for questions about privacy, confidentiality, and security, but will in no way replace existing responsibilities or activities of Offices within ED or develop ED guidance surrounding privacy. For example, while PTAC will respond to initial high-level questions, it will refer questions that require a more detailed legal or statistical response to FPCO, OGC, or NCES, as appropriate.  The appropriate group to respond to various questions will be determined through communications between the COR and PAC.  Training materials to be developed by PTAC will be done with input, review and comment from staff in appropriate Offices at ED and must be reviewed by the COR before publication or dissemination. The materials will be shared with SEAs, LEAs, and postsecondary institutions, as well as with Offices within ED that serve those same populations. <br />Additionally, the contractor should have the necessary expertise in or have access to individuals who have expertise in legal, security, statistical and/or policy issues with regard to privacy, confidentiality and security in order to provide technical assistance on privacy issues.  The contractor shall prepare materials on data privacy, confidentiality, and security practices related to education data, and also shall draw on experiences from other public service sectors (e.g., health, human services, and corrections).  This work will help keep SEAs, LEAs, and postsecondary institutions current with timely and accurate methods for protecting confidentiality within public reporting activities.</p>
<p><br />In response to the Draft PWS, ED hereby solicits capability statements from all qualified vendors.  <br />Capability Statement Instructions:<br />These statements shall be at a maximum 25 pages or less.  Vendors should include information regarding past performance (not included in the 25 pages) of similar work from other entities including federal and state agencies and private companies. This Information should reference previously demonstrated experience at the corporate, subcontract and consultant level.  If any of this experience is met through consultants, the contractor must provide evidence of commitment to work on this project.<br />Vendors should also submit resumes of proposed personnel (please see page 11 and 12 of the draft PWS).  Resumes are also not included in the 25 page limit.  <br />All interested parties shall demonstrate their expertise and experience related to the eleven tasks listed in the attached PWS:  <br />1.	 Management and Project Plan<br />2.	Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Document<br />3.	Privacy Toolkit<br />4.	Training Material<br />5.	Site Visits<br />6.	Support Center<br />7.	Regional Meetings<br />8.	Technical Assistance Tracking Database<br />9.	Lessons Learned Forum<br />10.	Privacy Advisor Committee<br />11.	Transition</p>
<p>Interested parties are asked when submitting the Capability Statements to include the following information on the title page: 1) Company Name and Mailing Address; 2) Point of contact (name, title, email address, and telephone number. All vendors should provide their size designation on their capability statement, as well as their GSA schedule contract numbers if applicable.<br />Note: The government will not pay for the provision of any information nor will it compensate any respondents for providing this information. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND IN NO WAY OBLIGATES THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD ANY CONTRACT. ED WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONDING TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p>The deadline for submitting capability statements (electronically) is July 28, 2010 by 2 pm EDT via email to the following: Sylvia.Reid@ed.gov and Sharon.Masciana@ed.gov .</p>

<DESC>This is intended as a market survey/public announcement
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a single source requirement for renewal of support on existing Kintana (HP PPM) software.  Hewlett Packard is the owner of the HP PPM application since acquiring Mercury Interactive.  HP PPM technology is proprietary and can only be configured by Hewlett Packard's trained and licensed personnel.  The FAA contemplates awarding a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) purchase order to fulfill this requirement. 
This product was originally acquired from Mercury as a 'suite', a group of pre-determined assets. HP has grandfathered in support pricing based on the suite.  The HP PPM products are now broken out by item (component) and not offered as a suite in the way that Mercury originally offered it.  Since third-party partners go by a percentage of list cost based on line item pricing, these vendors do not have the ability to price the support as a suite as grandfathered by HP.  
The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with Hewlett-Packard, 8000 Foothills Blvd, Roseville CA, 95747, in accordance with Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.2.4, Single Source Selection.
This announcement is for informational purposes only, not a request for proposals.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new and re-engineered FTA Bus Program is founded on the philosophy that "one size does not fit all" in the implementation of safety, security, and emergency preparedness efforts. Consistent with the "one size does not fit all" philosophy, the existing self-assessment tool was designed specifically for use by rural and small urban transit agencies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been validated through the onsite review process as an effective instrument in identifying smaller transit system strengths and areas in need of improvement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This tool shall have only limited applicability for use with mid-size and large transit bus agencies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Therefore a new and expanded self-assessment tool that reflects the operating characteristics and environments of mid to large transit agencies must be developed to support the evaluation of safety, security, and emergency preparedness performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for the continuation ofContract NNG07EK00C with Arizona State University (ASU) Lunar Reconnaissance OrbiterCamera (LROC) Investigation on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Mission.	ASU iscurrently performing both the flight operations, which includes spacecraft operationsplanning, scheduling, and engineering parameter review and trending, as well as thescience operations which includes initiating all target requests to the instrument,planning all instrument modes and turn-ons, data dissemination to the co-investigatorsand to the general scientific community through the Planetary Data System (PDS).  NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to ASU.  Theestimated period of performance of this cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) contract extensionwill be for twenty-four (24) months from March 1, 2011 through March 15, 2013.	ASU isthe only organization currently qualified to perform the subject requirement for thefollowing reasons:  1) This procurement will enable the science and flight operationsactivities to be merged and carried out at ASU with a substantial universityundergraduate and graduate student educational involvement.  Only ASU possesses the highlevel scientific expertise, the detailed knowledge of the LROC instrument and LROspacecraft, the capability to carry out the targeting and operations in a manner in whichthe scientific operations and the flight operations can be merged.  2) ASU scientists andengineers are unique in their familiarity with the LROC instrument design, testing andcalibration as well as the LRO spacecraft.  From 2005-2009, ASU designed, fabricated,calibrated, tested, and integrated the LROC instrument for the LRO spacecraft, includingat the Spacecraft level after delivery to LRO.	Under contract NNG07EK00C, ASU hassuccessfully carried out the science operations of the LROC instrument on the LROspacecraft since LRO launch in June 2009.  Dr. Mark Robinson of ASU, as a leading expertin his field of planetary geophysics, was selected by NASA Headquarters to lead thisinvestigation, based on an evaluation of his proposal submitted under the Announcement ofOpportunity for exploration measurements in NASAs LRO Mission (AO NNH04ZSS003O).  TheLROC instrument is a state-of-the-art, one-of-a-kind instrument.  In addition, ASUdeveloped software for:  testing the instruments on-orbit, generating target selection,checking telemetry received for health and safety of the instruments, processing the rawdata so that scientists can manipulate, display, and analyze the scientific datareceived, and producing summary data.  This effort requires the detailed understanding ofthe instrument and all related software.  Since no other organization was involved withthese activities on an in-depth level, no other organization currently has the knowledgeand experience to perform the requirement.  3) ASU scientists have helped lead the effortin the community to analyze the images and data products from the LROC Instrument, andare currently the only organization with the capability to carry out the combinedscientific and instrument operations in conjunction with the educational opportunities.  Statutory authority for this firm-fixed price procurement is 10 U.S.C. 304(c)(1)--OnlyOne Responsible Source.  However, organizations who believe they can provide theseservices without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this workshould fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication ofthis synopsis.	Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualificationsto perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30p.m. local time on July 30, 2010.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluatedsolely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on acompetitive basis.

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for the award of a newcontract with the University of New Hampshire (UNH) Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effectsof Radiation (CRaTER) Investigation on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Mission asa followon to the current Contract NNG05EB92C with Boston University (BU).  UNH, under asubcontract to BU, is currently performing both the flight operations, which includesspacecraft operations planning, scheduling, and engineering parameter review andtrending, as well as the science operations which includes initiating all calibrationrequests to the instrument, planning all instrument modes and turn-ons, datadissemination to the co-investigators and to the general scientific community through thePlanetary Data System (PDS).  NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to UNH.  Theestimated period of performance of this cost no fee (CNF) contract extension will be for twenty-four (24) months from March 1, 2011 through March 15, 2013. UNH is now the onlyorganization currently qualified to perform the subject requirement for the followingreasons:  1) In the fall of 2009, the CRaTER core personnel expertise (PrincipalInvestigator Dr. Harlan Spence, operations staff and science team members) all relocatedfrom BU to UNH, with NASA concurrence. To continue the CRaTER work without interruption,BU initiated a subcontract with UNH. We believe that it is in NASAs best interest tocontract the follow-on work directly with UNH, rather than continuing a contract with BU.2) This procurement will enable the science and flight operations activities to be mergedand carried out at UNH with a substantial university undergraduate and graduate studenteducational involvement.  Only UNH possesses the high level scientific expertise, thedetailed knowledge of the CRaTER instrument and LRO spacecraft, the capability to carryout the calibration and operations in a manner in which the scientific operations and theflight operations can be merged.  2) UNH scientists and engineers are unique in theirfamiliarity with the CRaTER instrument design, testing and calibration as well as the LROspacecraft.  From 2005-2009, the UNH team (then resident at BU) designed, fabricated,calibrated, tested, and integrated the CRaTER instrument for the LRO spacecraft,including at the Spacecraft level after delivery to LRO.  Under contract NNG05EB92C, theUNH team (while at BU and now UNH) has successfully carried out the science operations ofthe CRaTER instrument on the LRO spacecraft since LRO launch in June 2009.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Promega Corporation 2800 Woods Hollow Road, Madison, Wisconsin 53711-5399 to procure ADP-Glo Kinase Assay Kits.

The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives.  The NIH Chemical Genomics Center regularly screens its small molecule library collections against enzyme targets with known implications for disease.  As such, there is a clear need for kits or reagents which allow the sensitive and robust detection of enzyme activity in the presence of such small molecules. Promegas ADP-Glo kit has been used and validated by the NCGC for several different assays, and remains the most sensitive and useful method of detection for such screening applications.  One such project, related to the elucidation of inhibitors of the T. brucei isoform of phosphofructokinase, has been approved for screening, and the NCGC is in need of screening-quantity amounts of ADP-Glo, the validated and approved method of detection for this particular assay.  Having this reagent is essential to this and several other ongoing projects at NCGC, and is crucial to our ability to continue and maintain fruitful collaborations with the many institutions with whom we work so closely.  

Description:

1. ADP-Glo Kinase Assay, Catalog Number V9103, Quantity: 15 Each.

The sole source determination is based on the fact NIH Chemical Genomics Center has established a screening environment in which assays relevant to any number of diseases can be validated and screened against the institutes in-house repository of +300,000 small molecules for activity.  We have validated several assays that specifically use Promegas ADP-Glo kits to measure the activity of enzymes, allowing us to screen for compounds with potential as lead drugs against a variety of rare and neglected disorders, such as African Sleeping Sickness and Chagas disease.  Several vendors offer kits to measure ADP levels, which we have tested in lab, but only Promegas ADP-Glo kit provides the luminescent readout and high level of sensitivity we need for our high-throughput screening applications.  In addition, this particular kit is comprised of a proprietary collection of enzymes and buffers specifically optimized for such applications, and thus is not obtainable through any other vendors or means. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Human Genome Research Institute, NHGRI), 9800 Medical Center Drive, Building B, Room 1022 , Rockville, Maryland 20850.

Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 325414, Biological Product (except Diagnostic) Manufacturing with business size standard of 500 employees.  The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001).and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-44 (July 8, 2010). 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by July 28, 2010, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.

Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-(HG)-2010-197-DLM, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition,   Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Dorothy Maxwell.  Response may be submitted electronically to maxwelld@mail.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted.  Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

The items referenced above are components of the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Missions Support Station and (LCAC) common data recorder.  In order to maintain 100% pin-to-pin compatibility only the Tracewell Systems components will meet form, fit, function, and interchangeability requirements for the LCAC C4N CDR and the LMSS.  This acquisition is not suitable for full and open competition as the Government does not own the technical data packages or specifications to compete these procurements.  Developing another source for these components would require a redesign of the LCAC Common Data Recording Unit and the LMSS beyond the scope of the current task assigned to NSWC -PC.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Point Chehalis revetment project is located adjacent to the Westport Marina.  Damage to the revetment will be repaired by placing approximately 1,735 cubic yards (2,435 tons) of new armor rock along approximately 200 linear feet of revetment.   A small amount of gravel (approximately 30 tons) may also be placed temporarily to protect the asphalt pit run and sidewalk adjacent to the revetment from damage during equipment (track backhoe or crane access) to repair the structure, and would be removed at project completion.   The new armor rock material of average 9-17 ton size would be placed, and existing material would be reshaped to  conform with the minimum top elevation called for in the rehabilitation design (+25 MLLW) and will be similar in construction and elevation to the neighboring segments of groin/revetment.  The majority of the work would take place above the mean higher high water contour.   Some rock would be re-worked in the lower sections of the revetment below MLLW, and some additional rock would be incorporated.  The repair project is scheduled for a three week period in September 2010.  Actual construction activities are expected to last seven to 10 days depending on weather and tidal conditions.  Rock would be trucked to the site on existing, paved roads.  Equipment access to the site would also be via the existing paved road shoreward of the revetment.  Equipment to be utilized would include dump trucks to haul required rock as well as a hydraulic excavator or mobile crane to position the rock.<BR>This project is open to small business ONLY.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990 Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, with a size standard of $33.5 million.  For the purposes of this procurement, a firm is a small business if its annual average gross revenue, taken for the last 3 fiscal years, does not exceed $33.5 million.  For information concerning NAICS and SBA size standards, go to http://www.sba.gov.  Issue of the solicitation will be in electronic format only.  No disks or hard copy will be available.  Follow the registration procedures at www.fbo.gov to receive notification of solicitation/amendment posting.  <BR>Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), the solicitation will be available for download no earlier than 15 days following the posting of this synopsis.  There is no technical information available until the issue of the solicitation via the Internet.  The solicitation will contain the actual proposal due date.  WWW.FBO.GOV dates are approximate.  The magnitude of construction project is $250,000 to $500,000.

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for Educational Services (Private) Limited / Beaconhouse School System to demonstrate the commercial viability of installing solar photovoltaic power systems at approximately 400 private schools owned or operated by the ESL. Solar power will provide uninterrupted power at a time of frequent load shedding, lower the overall cost of power, and demonstrate science at work to pupils. The objectives of the study are to identify practical photovoltaic designs, demonstrate whether the concept is commercially viable, develop a baseline design which can be adapted to other schools in the system, provide documentation to support filing for permits and tariffs, and provide reassurance to lenders and investors, and to evaluate subsidized tariff options to promote renewable energy sources at commercial sites.</p>
<p>Educational Services (Private) Limited, a school management company based in Lahore, Pakistan, is the largest private educational company in Pakistan. It owns 150 schools and operates 250 more under franchise, with more than 180,000 students in seven countries. The Beaconhouse Schools brand is owned by ESL, a business whose founders started the Beaconhouse schools network.</p>
<p>Beaconhouse schools consume around $1.2 million in electricity costs each year but suffer frequent outages from load shedding. ESL is committed to environmentally sound business practices and established a subsidiary company, Beacon Energy Limited, to set up a 50 MW wind farm near Karachi which is on target to reach financial close by the end of 2010.</p>
<p>This USTDA funded feasibility study is designed to identify practical photovoltaic designs, demonstrate whether the concept is economically viable and develop a baseline design that can be adapted to other schools in the system and which ESL can use to procure and install a test array. Data and experience from the test installation will help guide the project in developing an implementation plan for the entire Beaconhouse school system. Further, the selected U.S. Contractor will provide documentation to support ESL in filing for permits, an electricity tariff and for use in negotiations for a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and Interconnect Agreement with distribution and transmission utilities.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $299,896 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), located at 260 Industrial Way West, Eatontown, NJ 07724 intends to enter into a contract on the basis of other than full and open competition for the Office of Information and Technology (OI&T). The TAC intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price contract consisting of one (1) base year and four (4) option years, to Vision Technologies, Inc., 530 McCormick Drive, Suite G, Glen Burnie, Maryland 21061-8200, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), Veterans First Contracting Program  and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-5, "Authorized or required by Statute", for services in support of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) Martinsburg, West Virginia, Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP). COOP is an ongoing effort of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Information and Technology (OI&T) in meeting VA's requirements and Department of Homeland Security's guidance in respect to Continuity of Government.  The procedures in the OI&T COOP require that reliable and secure telecommunications systems are put in place to ensure that deployed personnel are able to communicate with others outside their designated work areas using wireless telecommunications devices.  The VAMC in Martinsburg, WV, is one of the relocation sites; however, current carriers' cellular and PCS signals are not able to penetrate walls in certain areas of the campus.  This procurement calls for maintenance of an In-building Wireless Coverage System that extends cellular and PCS services into the Martinsburg VAMC Building 500 and broadcast signals to areas where current carriers' signals cannot penetrate. The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) for this effort is 541519. The estimated date of award for this action is August 30, 2010. 

This notification shall close on Friday, July 30, 2010. Questions/responses shall be submitted to the contract specialist at michael.brill@va.gov.  The Points of Contact (POCs) for this action are Michael Brill, Contract Specialist, michael.brill@va.gov and Anne Marie Vasconcelos, Contracting Officer, anne.vasconcelos@va.gov.

<DESC>TITLE: XRA SIMAF (Simulation and Analysis Facility) Facilities and Infrastucture Sources Sought/Capability Request for Information
DESCRIPTION: The Air Force Material Command (AFMC), Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), Capabilities Integration Directorate at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is conducting market research analyses including Sources  Sought/Capability Request for Information (CRFI) for Government Market Research purposes. Before submitting any information to the Government, be advised that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information you provide.  Your responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.    Not responding to this CRFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP. Only responses from US companies will be accepted. Any information provided by the Government at this time is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to a formal release of a Request for Proposal.
Submission of Proprietary Information Caution:  The government appreciates that interested firms may not be able to respond to this Sources Sought/ CRFI without disclosing information deemed "proprietary" or "competition sensitive."   Data submitted in response to this CRFI will be widely distributed and discussed within the government as it will be used to assist in developing an acquisition strategy.  It is the responsibility of respondents to clearly mark submitted information with appropriate restrictive markings.   Respondents are further advised that the government's analyses of your responses may require disclosure to Advisory and Assistance Services contractor personnel.  All members of the evaluation team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, Government members will be reminded of the! ir obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All support contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts. The Government has also determined that the support contractor personnel have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information.  The government's support contractors will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement concerning proprietary information prior to being granted access to your data.    

The Government is seeking interested firms to furnish the following information: 
(1) Company name, address, point of contact, telephone number and e-mail address. (2) Business size (if 8(a) provide proof of certification, etc.) under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541712. (3) Under which NAICS does your company usually provide supplies identified above? Do you consider a NAICS code other than 541712 to be more appropriate as a classification for the supplies identified above? Please include the rationale for your answer. (4) Which of the following would you see as your role in the performance of a potential requirement of this nature (ref: Acquisition Strategy Briefing from Industry Day)? (a) Prime Contractor; (b) Subcontractor; or (c) Other, and please describe. (5) Based on the technical requirements defined in the Facilities and Infrastructure Requirements Definition Document, do you feel the entire effort can be priced and executed as a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Effort and why?  If not, which requirements do you feel could be executed as a FFP, what contract type do you recommend for the remaining requirements, and why? (6) Discuss how you would recommend coordinating your Facilities and Infrastructure activities with potentially multiple SIMAF Modeling Simulation and Analysis contractors.(7) What are your capabilities/strengths with respect to performing the XRA SIMAF Facilities and Infrastructure mission?(8) The Air Force is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability.  Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting).  The clause reads, in part, as follows:  "Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec 1996) (b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction).  At least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. (2) Supplies (other than procurement from a nonmanufacturer of such supplies).  The concern shall perform work for at least 50 percent of the cost of manufacturing the!  supplies, not including the cost of materials ."  Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.  (9) AFMCFARS clause 5352.219-9001, "Use of Joint Ventures in Meeting the Limitations on Subcontracting Requirement (Nov 2007)" is planned for inclusion in this solicitation.  If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used.  Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.RESPONSES AND PAGE LIMITATIONS: Responses to this CRFI must be received No Later Than 1500 (EST) 11 Feb 2010.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.
<p>The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is exploring sources for a Marine Research Scientist.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />The Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is the research component of National Oceanic and Atmospherics' (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for the Northeast Region. NEFSC has an ongoing research program to use remotely-sensed data collected by satellites to monitor the spatial, seasonal, inter-annual and decadal variability in sea surface temperature and phytoplankton productivity of the Northeast United States continental shelf ecosystem, and understand how oceanographic variability influences fisheries productivity and the living marine resources within this region. The Northeast U.S. ecosystem is oceanographically diverse owing to its location at the confluence of the warm northward Gulf Stream and cold southward Slope Current. There is a complex pattern of oceanic fronts in the Northeast region due to interaction of strong tidal currents and topography in areas such as Georges Bank, Nantucket Shoals, Bay of Fundy, and the Scotian Shelf. Such oceanic fronts represent major biogeographical/ecosystem boundaries and are often associated with zones of elevated primary and secondary productivity. There are numerous reports in the scientific literature summarizing the importance of oceanic fronts to fisheries.</p>
<p>Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fronts, regions of sharp gradients in ocean surface temperature, can be detected by using satellite data. The methods for quantifying SST fronts from satellite data were developed and refined by oceanographers at the University of Rhode Island, Graduate School of Oceanography (GSO) and published in the scientific literature (Cayula &amp; Cornillon 1992). Climatology of SST front statistics has also been developed and published by GSO, for the Northeast US coastal region. The Northeast US coastal region is the principal focus area for this contract (see attached figure).</p>
<p>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:</p>
<p>Scope:<br />The purpose of this project is to validate, upgrade, and support the SST-CHL front detection (BOA) algorithm.</p>
<p>Specific Tasks:<br />1) The contractor shall validate the BOA against in situ and satellite data (Year 1). The contractor shall validate the BOA SST-CHL front algorithm by comparing results from the BOA with in situ and satellite data (Year 1). Satellite data, from sensors AVHRR on NOAA satellites and MODIS Aqua on NASA satellites, will be provided by NOAA-NEFSC, Narragansett Laboratory and will consist of high resolution (I-km) data. Data collected from shipboard surveys (in situ data) will also be provided by NOAA-NEFSC, Narragansett Laboratory.</p>
<p>2) The contractor shall upgrade and modify (as needed) the BOA (Year 2).</p>
<p>3) The contractor shall prepare a technical report, to eventually be published in the Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, detailing the results of the BOA validation (Year 2).</p>
<p>References:<br />References related to this work include oceanographic and remote sensing scientific technical reports and journals, technical scientific references and literature on oceanic fronts, accepted computer, statistical and analytical methods for satellite data processing, computer security policies and agency policies and directives. The C&amp;A requirements of clause 73 does not apply; and a Security Accreditation Package is not required for this contract.</p>

<p>The DOC/NOAA is seeking the following information:</p>
<p>Potential Respondents shall describe how they would propose to successfully perform these services, assuming that all services provided by Respondent would be accomplished in accordance with all applicable U.S. laws, regulations, policies, and procedures. In addition, Respondents shall indicate any relevant experience in the Fisheries industry.</p>
<p>Respondents shall not be obligated to provide the services described herein and it is understood by the United States Government that the cost estimates provided as a result of this request are "best" estimates only.</p>
<p>Note: This announcement is a Request for Information and no contract will be awarded pursuant to this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied, or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.

<DESC>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in North Carolina to develop an improved version of similarity search algorithm using modified Locality Sensitive Hashing called Satellite Image Base Retrieval Application (SIBRA). The technique allows the searching and classification of the defensive Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellite images by means other than space and time as is now provided.
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) requirement for an improved version of similarity search algorithm using modified Locality Sensitive Hashing called SIBRA. The Defensive Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) designs, builds, launches and maintains satellites monitoring the meteorological, oceanographic, and solar-terrestrial physics environments. Data is collected and is archived by memorandum of understanding (MOU) at NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center. Due to the dynamic nature, vastness and complexity of the data set, it has become essential to develop a scalable algorithm that has the capability of archiving this database. The Autonomous Control and Information Technology Center (ACIT), North Carolina A&amp;T is an organization specializing in digital imagery and patter recognition. They are completely unique in that they have extended their work to include environmental data and satellite imagery classification.</p>
<p>The Period of performance shall be August 2010 through May 2011.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington D.C. 20593-0001<br />Telephone 202-372-3695<br />Fax: 202-475-3904</p>

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for a new, dry (oil-free), high-vacuum leak detector.The system must support H2 sensing, i.e. the system is to offer 4He, 3He and H2 leakdetection capability. The equipment must be easily movable around the lab and be configured with at most twostandalone units, e.g. one being a high-throughput, high-vacuum pump station, while theother unit is a modest vacuum, high-sensitivity leak detector that is easily tied intothe fore-vacuum of the pump station. The complete pumping station and mass-spectrometry-based, high-sensitivity leak detectionequipment is to be able to pull down modestly large lab systems within a couple of hoursto a high vacuum (&lt; 10-6 Torr).  This implies a minimum pumping capacity of 200 l/sec(at pressures &lt;10-4 Torr) and a base pressure of 10-7 Torr  or better.  The systemmust enable leak detection of systems that range from having large leaks causing a verypoor vacuum (10 Torr and worse) to a very good vacuum with possibly very small leaks(&lt; 10-8 std.cc/sec) that only cause problems after cool-down to cryogenictemperatures.  Therefore, high crossover pressure (&gt; 10 Torr) and the inclusion of asniffer probe are essential, as is high leak rate sensitivity (better than 10-9std.cc/sec).The instrument must also be able to pull down the pressure in sizable test vessels (order100 liter) to a high vacuum within a couple of hours (reach 10-5 Torr in 1/2 to 1 hr,10-6 in 4-6 hours and dipping below 2*10-7 in 12-16 hrs).A summary of the requirements for this instrument are as follows:Oil-free;Leak rate sensitivity: Resolution to 5*10-10 Std.cc/sec or better;4He, 3He and H2 leak detection capability;Throughput: Exceeding 200 l/sec nearing the low-end pressure;Vacuum Limit: Better than 10-7 Torr;Crossover Pressure &gt; 10 Torr;Sniffer probe included;The systems need to be on wheels A single fully integrated system or at most two subsystems being one high-throughput,high-vacuum pump station and one modest-vacuum leak detector;Should be able to perform to spec through 2025Delivery to NASA Ames Research Center, Receiving Section, Building 255, Moffett Field, CA94035-0001 is required within 90 days ARO.

<SOLNBR>ED-IES-10-R-0074

<CONTACT>Joseph S. Gibbs, Contract Specialist, Phone (202) 245-6016, Fax 202-245-6297, Email joseph.gibbs@ed.gov
<DESC>The US Department of Education releases the solicitation for the subject impact evaluation. The Government requires a contract to evaluate the impact of the receipt of funds under the Race to the Top (RTT) and State Improvement Grant (SIG) programs on student achievement; the effect of State capacity (a key assumption of RTT) in improving student outcomes; and the relationship between implementation of four broad school turnaround models and their strategies with student outcomes.
<p>RTT grants, currently authorized by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, are designed to encourage and reward States that are already implementing significant education reforms to extend their efforts and to advance comprehensive and coherent education reform in districts across the State for the purpose of improving student outcomes. Discretionary grants will be awarded to States that have made significant progress and articulate their goals in four reform areas. State applications must include a comprehensive approach to education reform. Awards made with the $4 billion in Recovery Act funding will support project periods of up to 4 years, and are estimated to range from $20 million to $700 million per state. In distributing funds, states must give priority to high-need districts, and require that participating districts sign a binding agreement or memorandum of understanding with the state that specifies the scope of the work to be implemented by the district including a commitment to implement one of four school turnaround models aimed at turning around or closing these persistently lowest-performing schools. Phase I awards will be announced in April 2010, and Phase II awards will be announced in September 2010.</p>
<p>SIGs are authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to improve student achievement in the persistently lowest- achieving schools. The Recovery Act added an additional $3 billion to the FY09 program amount of $546.6 million. Under SIG for Turning Around Low-Performing Schools, funds go to States based on each State's share of Title I funding. States then distribute funds to districts with the lowest-achieving Title I schools that demonstrate the greatest need and strongest commitment to implement one of four school turnaround models aimed at turning around or closing these persistently lowest-achieving schools. Congress recently enacted appropriations language allowing State Educational Agencies (SEAs) to award up to $2 million for each participating school. This higher limit will permit an SEA to award directly the amount that the Department believes typically would be required for the successful implementation of the turnaround, restart, or transformation model in a Tier I or Tier II school. FY 2009 school improvement funds are available for obligation by SEAs and Local Educational Agencies (LEAs) through September 30, 2011. In its application for these funds, an SEA may request a waiver of the period of availability to permit the SEA and its LEAs to obligate the funds through September 30, 2013. An LEA's proposed budget should cover a three-year period (if the SEA or LEA has applied for a waiver to extend the period of availability of funds).</p>
<p>The Department anticipates the award of a hybrid contract (cost &amp; fixed price tasks) for a total period of performance for 60 months.</p>

B. Background The laboratory investigates the interactions of encapsulated bacteria and bacterial polysaccharide vaccines with the host immune system. This information is critical for understanding of the biology of host immune response against PS vaccines and useful for the improvement of the immunogenicity of polysaccharide vaccines. Our research relies heavily on the use of flow cytometer which is used to acquire cells stained with antibodies or cellular markers. Use of multiparametric flow cytometer allows us to characterize subsets within given cell populations. A flow cytometer is an instrument that simultaneously measures and then analyzes multiple physical characteristics of single particles, usually cells, as they flow in a fluid stream through a beam of light. The properties measured include a particle&rsquo;s relative size, relative granularity or internal complexity, and relative fluorescence intensity. These characteristics are determined using an optical-to-electronic coupling system that records how the cell or particle scatters incident laser light and emits fluorescence. A flow cytometer is made up of three main systems: fluidics, optics, and electronics. The fluidics system transports particles in a stream to the laser beam for interrogation. In the flow cytometer, cells are carried to the laser intercept in a fluid stream. Any suspended particle or cell from 0.2&ndash;150 micrometers in size is suitable for analysis. The portion of the fluid stream where particles are located is called the sample core. When particles pass through the laser intercept, they scatter laser light. The optics system consists of lasers to illuminate the particles in the sample stream and optical filters to direct the resulting light signals to the appropriate detectors. Any fluorescent molecules present on the particle fluoresce. The scattered and fluorescent light is collected by appropriately positioned lenses. A combination of beam splitters and filters steers the scattered and fluorescent light to the appropriate detectors. The detectors produce electronic signals proportional to the optical signals striking them. The electronics system converts the detected light signals into electronic signals that can be processed by the computer. List mode data are collected on each particle or event. The characteristics or parameters of each event are based on its light scattering and fluorescent properties. The data are collected and stored in the computer. This data can be analyzed to provide information about subpopulations within the sample. Since our laboratory depends heavily on the use of flow cytometer to assess various immune cell populations and their expressed antigens, we require a machine which can provide maximum flexibility and high-performance typically found in high-end systems, but in a small, light-weight, bench top package. The minimum mandatory requirements are as follows: Fluidics: Rate of sample flow for a single stream :&ge;1000 events /sec with a minimum carryover in between samples. Automatic back flush to avoid clogging of sample injection port. Minimal Sheath fluid usage to reduce daily running costs. Optics: The system should be able to provide use of maximum lasers with a possibility of future upgrades. Lasers preferred are blue (488nm) and red (640nm) with possible upgrades to violet (405nm) and yellow/green lasers (561nm) in future. The more upgradable the machine, the better for future needs. A high resolution instrument with log and linear scales for FSC and SSC parameters Ability to resolve the eight peaks on rainbow beads with maximum separation. Also, an instrument with Interchangeable and replaceable Filters and Dichroics, Flexible Dye Selection would be preferred to allow more flexibility in choice of antibodies and immunophenotyping panels in the future. Electronics: Ability to import and analyze FCS 2.0 or 3.0 list mode data files from any source. This would allow us to compare data with the machine from the core facility, which is currently being used for our experiments. Software: Software should include fully automated pre and post acquisition compensation, integrated calculation sheet and ability to define custom parameters Software should allow off line experiment design and analysis Software should be user friendly, and comparable to Flowjo software that is currently being used in the lab because the lab currently has two user licenses for Flowjo and has been using flowjo for all data analysis till now. Computer: The machine should come with a computer /monitor, preferably widescreen at least a 20-22 inches or an extended desktop to allow view of all acquisition controls while reading the samples as well as simultaneous view of cell populations along with the flour chrome panels such as isotype controls and single stained compensation controls. This allows the user to have better set up of the experiment from the beginning. Training: The contractor shall provide training after installation has occurred. The contractor shall provide on site training to all FDA lab personnel so that assay-specific related questions can be addressed. Operation and Maintenance: The contractor shall provide maintenance to include upgrades and including warranty The benchtop flowcytometer will be used for the acquisition and analysis of immunopheno types of B and T cells and other assays such as cytokine expression, viability assay , apoptosis assays, proliferation assays etc. Part II: Work Requirements Technical Requirements &bull; Ability to analyze at least five different fluorochromes on a given sample. &bull; Should include at least the blue and red lasers since most of the antibodies we use are conjugated with flourochrome dyes that can be detected with these two lasers. &bull; Should be upgradable to more lasers and detectors in future. &bull; Due to size restrictions of the space we are being provided for, should be small enough to fit on a bench top. &bull; Should come with user friendly software for acquisition and analysis. It should also be able to export and save acquired data on Flowjo software (should be able to save files in fcs 3 format). &bull; Should have minimum daily running costs and easy maintenance. Deliverables &bull; A benchtop flow cytometer instrument (platform consisting of lasers, optical detectors, filters and dichroic mirrors, flow cell, sheath and waste tanks etc.) &bull; Computer &bull; Software Part III: Supporting Information Security Access will be computer based user log in.

<p><strong>1. Background:</strong></p>
<p>The Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA) provides legal advice, and services required to support the ICE mission while defending the immigration laws of the United States in the administrative and Federal courts. Pursuant to section 442 of the Homeland Security Act, OPLA is the exclusive legal representative of ICE and the DHS legal component authorized to represent the government in all exclusion, deportation, and removal proceedings before the Executive Office of Immigration Review.</p>
<p>As the legal representative of the U.S. Government at immigration court hearings, OPLA attorneys handle a variety of immigration-related issues that range from contested removals to custody determinations to applications for administrative relief. Most of the hearings involve criminal aliens, terrorists, and human rights abusers, among others.<br /><br />The Philadelphia Office of the Principal Legal Advisor works in tandem with EOIR and both components have long been co-located. Both offices were scheduled to move together to a new location but budgetary constraints will only provide funding for the moving of one office this fiscal year. EOIR will be moved to its new location in the next few months and files that were easily exchanged between the two components will now have to be couriered from OPLA to EOIR and back again. The OPLA office is scheduled to move in the near future but the timeline is uncertain as GSA figures prominently in the build out of the new space and they are waiting for funding. We are therefore basing this contract on one base period of 6 months with three (3) 6-month option periods for a total of 24 months.<br /><br /><strong>2. Objective:</strong></p>
<p>OPLA's Philadelphia (OCC), requires courier service to transport files and/or documents between the Office of the Chief Counsel at 1600 Callowhill Street and the temporary swing space located at the Nix Federal Building at 900 Market Street. (NOTE: OCC Philadelphia will be moving to the 900 Market Street location in the near future).</p>

Pickup will typically consist of 1-8 locked bins weighing approximately 30-70 lbs each.<br /><br />2) Deliver locked bins to&nbsp;Nix Federal Building, OPLA, Suite 500, 900 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107 NOT LATER THAN 8:45AM same day.</p>

<p>4) Deliver locked bins to&nbsp;OCC Philadelphia Office at 1600 Callowhill Street, 4th Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19130 NOT LATER THAN 9:30 AM same day.</p>
<p>b) Courier Service will obtain an Official Government employee signature at each office verifying pickup and/or delivery of locked boxes.</p>
<p>c) The courier shall not read or peruse through any materials/information being transported at any point during performance of the services.</p>
<p>d) At the conclusion of the route, the courier will provide the&nbsp;Philadelphia OCC Point of Contact (POC) with the daily delivery receipts documenting all deliveries and/or pickups. The Philadelphia OCC POC will be identified on the award document.</p>
<p>4. Invoicing:</p>
<p>The contractor will invoice monthly in arrears. Billing instructions will be included on the award document.</p>

<p>Background checks as outlined below shall be accomplished prior to the first day of performance. Background checks shall be accomplished at no additional cost to the government.</p>
<p>GENERAL</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has determined that performance of the tasks as described in this future award requires that the Contractor, subcontractor(s), vendor(s), etc. (herein known as Contractor) have access to sensitive DHS information, and that the Contractor will adhere to the following.</p>
<p>SUITABILITY DETERMINATION</p>
<p>DHS shall have and exercise full control over granting, denying, withholding or terminating unescorted government facility and/or sensitive Government information access for Contractor employees, based upon the results of a background investigation. DHS may, as it deems appropriate, authorize and make a favorable entry on duty (EOD) decision based on preliminary security checks. The favorable EOD decision would allow the employees to commence work temporarily prior to the completion of the full investigation. The granting of a favorable EOD decision shall not be considered as assurance that a full employment suitability authorization will follow as a result thereof. The granting of a favorable EOD decision or a full employment suitability determination shall in no way prevent, preclude, or bar the withdrawal or termination of any such access by DHS, at any time during the term of the contract. No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed to EOD and/or access sensitive information or systems without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the Office of Professional Responsibility, Personnel Security Unit (OPR-PSU). No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed unescorted access to a Government facility without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the OPR-PSU. Contract employees assigned to the contract not needing access to sensitive DHS information or recurring access to DHS' facilities will not be subject to security suitability screening.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS</p>
<p>Contract employees (to include applicants, temporaries, part-time and replacement employees) under the contract, needing access to sensitive information, shall undergo a position sensitivity analysis based on the duties each individual will perform on the contract. The results of the position sensitivity analysis shall identify the appropriate background investigation to be conducted. Background investigations will be processed through the Personnel Security Unit. Prospective Contractor employees with adequate security clearances issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) may not be required to submit complete security packages, as the clearance issued by DISCO may be accepted. Prospective Contactor employees without adequate security clearances issued by DISCO shall submit the following completed forms to the Personnel Security Unit through the COTR, no less than 5 days before the starting date of the contract or 5 days prior to the expected entry on duty of any employees, whether a replacement, addition, subcontractor employee, or vendor:</p>
<p>1. Standard Form 85P, "Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions" Form will be submitted via e-QIP (electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing)<br />(2 copies)</p>
<p>2. FD Form 258, "Fingerprint Card" (2 copies)</p>
<p>3. Foreign National Relatives or Associates Statement</p>
<p>4. DHS 11000-9, "Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act"</p>
<p>5. Optional Form 306, "Declaration for Federal Employment" (applies to contractors as well)</p>
<p>6. Authorization for Release of Medical Information</p>
<p>Required forms will be provided by DHS at the time of award of the contract. Only complete packages will be accepted by the OPR-PSU. Specific instructions on submission of packages will be provided upon award of contract.<br />Be advised that unless an applicant requiring access to sensitive information has resided in the US for the past three of the past five years, the Government may not be able to complete a satisfactory background investigation. In such cases, DHS retains the right to deem an applicant as ineligible due to insufficient background information.</p>
<p>The use of Non-U.S. citizens, including Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), is not permitted in the performance of this contract for any position that involves access to, development of, or maintenance to any DHS IT system.</p>
<p>CONTINUED ELIGIBILITY</p>
<p>If a prospective employee is found to be ineligible for access to Government facilities or information, the COTR will advise the Contractor that the employee shall not continue to work or to be assigned to work under the contract.<br />The OPR-PSU may require drug screening for probable cause at any time and/or when the contractor independently identifies circumstances where probable cause exists.</p>
<p>The OPR-PSU may require reinvestigations when derogatory information is received and/or every 5 years.</p>
<p>DHS reserves the right and prerogative to deny and/or restrict the facility and information access of any Contractor employee whose actions are in conflict with the standards of conduct, 5 CFR 2635 and 5 CFR 3801, or whom DHS determines to present a risk of compromising sensitive Government information to which he or she would have access under this contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor will report any adverse information coming to their attention concerning contract employees under the contract to the OPR-PSU through the COTR. Reports based on rumor or innuendo should not be made. The subsequent termination of employment of an employee does not obviate the requirement to submit this report. The report shall include the employee's name and social security number, along with the adverse information being reported.</p>
<p>The OPR-PSU must be notified of all terminations/resignations within five days of occurrence. The Contractor will return, if issued, any expired DHS identification cards and building passes, or those of terminated employees to the COTR. If an identification card or building pass is not available to be returned, a report must be submitted to the COTR, referencing the pass or card number, name of individual to whom issued, the last known location and disposition of the pass or card. The COTR will return the identification cards and building passes to the responsible ID Unit.</p>

Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(End of Provision)<br />52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999)<br />The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 calendar days before the contract expires.<br />(End of Clause)<br />52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000)<br />(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 calendar days before the contract expires; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.<br />(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.<br />(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 66 months.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>Economic Price Adjustment for Gasoline: The awarded prices for the option period line items, if exercised, shall be adjusted for increases/decreases in gasoline prices at time of exercise.</p>
<p>(a) To the extent that contract cost increases/decreases are provided for by this economic price adjustment clause, the vendor warrants that the prices in this proposal for any option periods do not include any amount to protect against such contingent cost increases (no increases for gasoline prices included in the option periods).</p>
<p>(b) The cost index, for the purpose of price adjustment under this clause, shall be the American Automobile Association (AAA) Daily Fuel Gauge Report, Current Price per Gallon for Philadelphia, PA, unleaded regular, available at http://www.fuelgaugereport.com, as of July 15, 2010</p>
<p>(1) The Base Index, for the purposes of price adjustment under this clause, shall be $2.75, the most recent index published prior to the issue of this solicitation (rounded .5 and up, to the next higher number). This Base Index shall remain constant throughout the life of the contract, including all options.</p>
<p>(2) The Adjusting Index shall be the most recent Index published on the date the Government provides the contractor preliminary written notice of its intent to exercise an option period. In the AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report Current Price per Gallon for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Gasoline, unleaded regular discontinues, or alters substantially, its method of calculating the Index cited herein, the parties shall mutually agree upon an appropriate substitute for determining the price adjustment described herein.</p>
<p>(c) In preparation for exercise of an option period, the Contracting Officer shall apply the difference between the Base Index and the Adjusting Index to the option year prices by multiplying the increase/decrease times the number of gallons identified for each line item. Only the line items of the option year being exercised will be adjusted.</p>
<p>(d) An example of an adjustment calculation is provided below for informational purposes only.</p>
<p>For purposes of this example, assume that the contract price for the option period being exercised $2,000.00 per month, and includes costs for 200 gallons of gasoline. If the Base Index (the most recent index published prior to the issue of this solicitation) is $3.50 per gallon and Adjustment Index (the most recent Index published on the date the Government provides the contractor preliminary written notice of its intent to exercise an option period) is $3.65 per gallon, the calculations for contract price adjustment would be as follows:</p>
<p>Adjusting Index $3.65 per gallon<br />Minus the Base Index -$3.50 per gallon<br />Equals increase (or decrease) to the Base Index <br />$ .15 increase</p>
<p>Option Line Item gasoline quantity multiplied by increase (or decrease) 200 * .15 = $30.00<br />Option Line Item price adjusted by increase ( or decrease) $2,000.00 + $30.00 = $2,030.00</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br><BR>Action:  Combined Synopsis/Solicitation<BR>Solicitation Number:  W912KN10-T-0030<BR>Set Aside:  100 % Small Business Set Aside<BR>Site Visit: 21 July 2010 @ 1000 Hours<BR>Response Date:  28 July 2010 @1000 Hours<BR><BR>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12 and supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued. The 177th Fighter Wing has a requirement for clearing of vegetation at its Warren Grove Range, located at Route 539, Burlington County, New Jersey. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this work is 561730 with a small business size standard of $7 million dollars annually. This is a 100% small business set-aside.  A firm fixed price contract will be awarded.<BR><BR><BR>STATEMENT OF WORK<BR><BR>General Requirements: <BR>The contractor shall furnish all transportation, skilled labor, supplies and wheeled ROWMAC rotary flail clearing equipment necessary to complete the statement of work in accordance with the conditions listed.  The intended result is to provide Warren Grove Range personnel with areas (fire breaks) cleared of vegetation that they can continue to maintain with their own equipment. <BR>Rotary flail mowing has proven to be the best clearing method due to 1) the complete chipping and removal of cut product, and 2) the limited slash fire fuel load created during mowing operations. Alternate methods such as the use of a rotary axe mower type head for clearing have not provided the desired result due to the limited diameter breast height (DBH) clearing capabilities. The contractor will comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local (to include NJANG) regulations, and environmental and occupational safety requirements.<BR>Location:                                  <BR>Warren Grove Gunnery Range, Route 539, Burlington County, New Jersey<BR>Description of Service: <BR>Contractor shall mechanically clear and chip all trees while not destroying the root system.  Remove all overhanging branches to a height of at least 12 feet and clear all vegetation in areas that have been designated as fire breaks by WG Range personnel.  Clear, chip and remove vegetation to approximately a 15 foot maximum width from both sides of the road edge or a maximum of 25 feet from designated single side road edge. Range personnel or other authorized personnel under contract with the Range, shall mark out specific areas that are deemed environmentally sensitive and shall not be worked upon or mowed. Equipment to be utilized must be a wheeled machine in order to minimize impact upon the environmental habitats, as proven by past contracted practices. <BR>The finished product must be able to be mowed by a wheeled tractor driven tow behind standard rotary cutter (i.e. Brush hog).  The root system for all vegetation must be preserved; NO dozing or digging will be authorized. <BR><BR>Estimate:<BR>            Estimate is based on a per day amount which includes equipment and labor. The contractor will schedule the days to work with WG Range personnel; this schedule will be mission-based and subject to change at any time at no additional cost to the government.  The entire job must be started no earlier than 1 November 2010 and completed no later than 31 December 2010 due to nesting season(s) for identified threatened/endangered species. <BR>Experience:<BR>            Contractor must demonstrate past performance experience working in areas adjacent to wetlands and the pinelands of NJ, and in and around threatened and endangered species.

FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 332313 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.***


*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase Flexible Borated Shielding. ***

Background:  The NCNR designs, builds, operates and maintains a suite of neutron scattering instrumentation used in the conduct of material structure research.  A large portion of the design effort centers on the placement of neutron and gamma ray shielding such that unwanted radiation doesnt interfere with personal safety, degrade the quality of data gathered, or cause damage to equipment and instrumentation.  A typical shielding arrangement is a matrix of various materials, chosen for the way that the various forms of incident radiation react upon contact or penetration.  

One form of radiation requiring attenuation is thermal neutrons.  These can be absorbed by 10B, an isotope of boron that represents about 20 percent of the atoms in naturally occurring boron.  The challenge in using 10B (a powder) is in achieving a uniform areal density surrounding the thermal neutron radiation field.  Placing the powder in metal canisters is very costly, engineering intensive and subject to settling due to gravity (and leaving an open pathway for thermal neutrons).  Mixing the boron in epoxy has met with limited success, but the epoxy can be difficult to cast into the appropriate shapes and is susceptible to radiation damage.

In the last 10 years, the NCNR has had success using a flexible polymer matrix containing boron that has been enriched to give a high percentage of the 10B isotope.  The flexible polymer matrix provides an excellent method for placing 10B where it is needed without causing secondary radiation problems and provides a uniform dispersion of the 10B atoms.  Additionally, the material can be cut to size easily with shears.

This product (borated shielding) may also be referred to as boronated shielding, particularly outside of the United States.

ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC-39)

1352.215-73 INQUIRIES (MAR 2000)
 
  Offerors must submit all questions concerning this solicitation in writing to the Contracting Officer. They must be received no later than seven calendar days after the date of this solicitation. All responses to the questions will be made in writing and included in an amendment to the solicitation.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Low Level Background Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer. ***

Background:  

NISTs Physics Laboratory has a requirement for a Low Level Background Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer, which will be used for the measurement of very low activities of beta- and alpha-emitting radionuclides, e.g., H-3, C-14, Fe-55, Co-57, Co-60, Ni-63, Sr-90 + Y-90, Tc-99, Cs-134, Cs-137, Ba-133, Pb-210+Bi-210, Po-210, Ra-226 + daughters, U, Np-237, Pu-241, Pu-239, Pu-240, Am-241, Cm-243, and Cm-244. Although a significant fraction of these radionuclides have gamma ray emissions that are normally used for measurement, the quantitative analysis of very small activities of these species is greatly facilitated by chemical separation from complex matrices followed by measurement of their beta or alpha emissions with high efficiency by liquid scintillation counting in the presence of very low background rates.

***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

Line Item 0001: One (1) Low Level Background Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications: 

1.	The main sample light detection configuration shall consist of at least two photomultiplier tubes (PMTs).

2.	The instrument shall offer an automatic spectrum stabilization capability to monitor and adjust the PMT high voltages in order to keep the signal output constant. 

3.	The background signal shall be kept as low as possible by means of both active and passive radiation shielding, pulse amplitude comparison, electromagnetic noise suppression and static electricity elimination.  Acceptable background rates for H-3, C-14 and alpha-emitters are given in specification 11.

(a) The active shielding shall consist of a separate guard system for detection of cosmic radiation and environmental gamma radiation that surrounds the sample detection system such that the sample detector signals are in anti-coincidence with the guard signals. 
 
(b) Active and passive shielding surrounding the sample detection system shall be standard, integral components of the instrument.

(c) The instrument shall offer a pulse amplitude comparison feature to decrease background from optical crosstalk and shall be adjustable by the user to minimize this crosstalk.

(d) Potential electromagnetic interference with the sample signals from power cables and radiofrequency sources shall be suppressed or eliminated automatically.

(e) Deleterious effects and spurious false events from static electricity shall be prevented by an appropriate device such as an ionizing source to protect against formation of static electric charges on sample vials, moving sample holders and other parts of the equipment.

4.	Additional instrument stabilization and low background maintenance shall be ensured by appropriate internal temperature control/cooling.

5.	Pulse shape discrimination between signals produced by alpha and beta emissions is required and shall be user-adjustable to optimize the electronic separation of alpha and beta events. It shall enable measurement of alpha events in the presence of a 100,000-fold excess of beta events. Simultaneous spectral acquisition of both alpha and beta signals must be possible.

6.	Instrument shall offer quench indication monitoring by means of an external radiation source. 

7.	All sample and guard event data, both coincident and non-coincident, must be accessible for examination to evaluate guard performance.

8.	Instrument shall offer dual programmable multichannel analyzers to provide multiple counting parameters and full spectral analysis capability.

9.	The Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer must have a fully-programmable, PC-based operation running on a Microsoft XP software platform with live spectral display capability as well as instantaneous monitoring of the status of the current measurement. It must also be able to store and retrieve previously acquired spectra.

10.	Instrument shall offer a back-up battery power system for supporting RAM and critical measurement data for at least 2 days following a power outage.

11.	Achievable instrument performance acceptance criteria for H-3, C-14 and alpha-emitting radionuclides: 

(a)	H-3: efficiency for unquenched samples > or = 65%; efficiency for typical water samples (quenched) 25 to 30%; background rates for {8 mL water + 12 mL liquid scintillation cocktail} < or = 1.5 counts/minute

(b)	C-14: efficiency for unquenched samples > or = 95%; background rates < 0.3 counts/minute for 7 mL vial

(c)	Alpha-emitters: efficiency > or = 95%; background rates less than 0.2 counts/minute with pulse shape discrimination enabled.

Express Warranty

The contractor shall warrant the instrument for a period of at least one year.

Delivery

FOB Destination delivery terms are requested, and shall take place no later than 180 days after receipt of order.  FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.

However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offerors FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.

QUOTATION EVALUATION: 

Evaluation Factors

Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Experience, 3) Past Performance, and 4) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equally important to price. 

Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award.  If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NISTs requirements. 

Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offerors experience providing similar equipment. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same equipment they are proposing for the current requirement. 
Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years.  In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references.  The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable.  The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offerors past performance.  The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.

 Price:  The Government will evaluate price for reasonableness. 

Past Performance, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Low Level Background Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer. ***

Background:  

NISTs Physics Laboratory has a requirement for a Low Level Background Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer, which will be used for the measurement of very low activities of beta- and alpha-emitting radionuclides, e.g., H-3, C-14, Fe-55, Co-57, Co-60, Ni-63, Sr-90 + Y-90, Tc-99, Cs-134, Cs-137, Ba-133, Pb-210+Bi-210, Po-210, Ra-226 + daughters, U, Np-237, Pu-241, Pu-239, Pu-240, Am-241, Cm-243, and Cm-244. Although a significant fraction of these radionuclides have gamma ray emissions that are normally used for measurement, the quantitative analysis of very small activities of these species is greatly facilitated by chemical separation from complex matrices followed by measurement of their beta or alpha emissions with high efficiency by liquid scintillation counting in the presence of very low background rates.

***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

Line Item 0001: One (1) Low Level Background Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications: 

1.	The main sample light detection configuration shall consist of at least two photomultiplier tubes (PMTs).

2.	The instrument shall offer an automatic spectrum stabilization capability to monitor and adjust the PMT high voltages in order to keep the signal output constant. 

3.	The background signal shall be kept as low as possible by means of both active and passive radiation shielding, pulse amplitude comparison, electromagnetic noise suppression and static electricity elimination.  Acceptable background rates for H-3, C-14 and alpha-emitters are given in specification 11.

(a) The active shielding shall consist of a separate guard system for detection of cosmic radiation and environmental gamma radiation that surrounds the sample detection system such that the sample detector signals are in anti-coincidence with the guard signals. 
 
(b) Active and passive shielding surrounding the sample detection system shall be standard, integral components of the instrument.

(c) The instrument shall offer a pulse amplitude comparison feature to decrease background from optical crosstalk and shall be adjustable by the user to minimize this crosstalk.

(d) Potential electromagnetic interference with the sample signals from power cables and radiofrequency sources shall be suppressed or eliminated automatically.

(e) Deleterious effects and spurious false events from static electricity shall be prevented by an appropriate device such as an ionizing source to protect against formation of static electric charges on sample vials, moving sample holders and other parts of the equipment.

4.	Additional instrument stabilization and low background maintenance shall be ensured by appropriate internal temperature control/cooling.

5.	Pulse shape discrimination between signals produced by alpha and beta emissions is required and shall be user-adjustable to optimize the electronic separation of alpha and beta events. It shall enable measurement of alpha events in the presence of a 100,000-fold excess of beta events. Simultaneous spectral acquisition of both alpha and beta signals must be possible.

6.	Instrument shall offer quench indication monitoring by means of an external radiation source. 

7.	All sample and guard event data, both coincident and non-coincident, must be accessible for examination to evaluate guard performance.

8.	Instrument shall offer dual programmable multichannel analyzers to provide multiple counting parameters and full spectral analysis capability.

9.	The Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer must have a fully-programmable, PC-based operation running on a Microsoft XP software platform with live spectral display capability as well as instantaneous monitoring of the status of the current measurement. It must also be able to store and retrieve previously acquired spectra.

10.	Instrument shall offer a back-up battery power system for supporting RAM and critical measurement data for at least 2 days following a power outage.

11.	Achievable instrument performance acceptance criteria for H-3, C-14 and alpha-emitting radionuclides: 

(a)	H-3: efficiency for unquenched samples > or = 65%; efficiency for typical water samples (quenched) 25 to 30%; background rates for {8 mL water + 12 mL liquid scintillation cocktail} < or = 1.5 counts/minute

(b)	C-14: efficiency for unquenched samples > or = 95%; background rates < 0.3 counts/minute for 7 mL vial

(c)	Alpha-emitters: efficiency > or = 95%; background rates less than 0.2 counts/minute with pulse shape discrimination enabled.

Express Warranty

The contractor shall warrant the instrument for a period of at least one year.

Delivery

FOB Destination delivery terms are requested, and shall take place no later than 180 days after receipt of order.  FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) and the Eastern Region Acquisition Division-Kansas City, MO (ERAD), intend to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for single page document scanning, data entry, and data verification for up to five current logbook forms with a one-week return time for their five ongoing logbook programs. Background: The SEFSC Logbook Department will send batches of forms from up to five logbook programs on a weekly basis. The volume of form to be key-entered per batch will vary by program/form type and because of changes in the number of fishing trips, seasonal openings, weather, etc. It is expected that the volume per batch will range from 300 forms and 1200 forms per week. The number keystrokes per form is also highly variable depending on the number of different species of fish that are caught, the number of gear, and the number of fishing areas. Depending on the type of form, the number of keystrokes per form can vary from 20 to 200. The logbook forms are pre-printed questionnaires which are answered by permit holders who are required to submit one or more form after each fishing trip. Completed forms are considered Confidential Data and a non-disclosure agreement between SEFSC and the vendor will be required.
<p>&bull; Coastal Fisheries Logbook Reports<br />&bull; No-Fishing Reports<br />&bull; Discard Reporting forms<br />&bull; Atlantic Migratory Species Set forms for the Pelagic Longline program<br />&bull; Dealer Reporting forms for the Highly Migratory Species (HMS) Dealer program</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide a separate bid each of the five programs based on the approximate number of forms estimated to be processed per month per program. Quotes should be presented as a price per page. Include any set-up coast, yearly maintenance fees, and fees required for minor modification needed for slight changes to the form design which is made annually.</p>

The aircraft requiring work is DHC-6-300 S.N. 740, current tail number N48RF with approximately seventeen thousand hours and fourteen thousand cycles. Aircraft will require complete repainting after the following work scope. Complete repaint was done in January 2006.</p>
<p>A. Scope: The contractor shall comply with applicable Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) and all aircraft manufacture's requirements. The Contractor will provide all special tools, facilities, equipment, and certified technical staffing to perform tasks. Maintenance Contractors must be an FAA approved repair station or equivalent Approved Maintenance Organization (AMO) if Canadian for the Twin Otter. The Government shall be responsible for scheduling all work against this contract. The Government reserves the right to exercise or cancel any part of this agreement. Once the aircraft arrives at the Contractors facility, no work shall begin until AOC has given the approval for such work to begin. Only the work that is being requested shall be done. Any additional work or discrepancies must have prior approval from the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide a list of discrepancies/tear down inspection report to AOC. The report shall include the extent of the inspection, condition found on all major components, outstanding service bulletins and airworthiness directives that must be complied with, and any recommendations for maintenance that would prevent future failures if applicable.</p>
<p>The Contractor may sub-contract out inspection, maintenance, overhaul, and repair work. The Government reserves the right to approve or disapprove, any sub contractor.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be responsible for all FAA and AOC required documentation to include but not limited to approval for return to service.</p>
<p>A.1 Delivery Requirements: A government flight crew shall fly the aircraft to the Contractor's facility. AOC and/or the flight crew shall notify the Contractor as soon as the need for service, inspection, and repair has been identified. If requested, all scheduled events and required services will be brought to the contractor's attention before award of the contract. Government owned parts, equipment, and property shall be returned to the Government. The cost of shipping the returnables shall be the responsibility of the Government.</p>
<p>A.2 Quality Assurance: NOAA/AOC may desire to have a representative witness any part of this contract. The Contractor shall keep the NOAA/Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) apprised of the progress and schedule. Any repairs outside of this contract must be approved by the Contracting Officer before repairs are started. NOAA shall have access to the aircraft throughout the terms of this contract. NOAA will provide representative for final acceptance and test flight.</p>
<p>A.3 Insurance Against Loss or Damage to Government Property: The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain hull liability insurance of not less than $2,500,000.00 to cover the aircraft on which this work will be performed. The policies evidencing the required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Governments interest shall not be effective: <br />- For such a period as the laws of the State in which this work is to be performed prescribe; or Until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice to the Contracting Officer, whichever period is longer.</p>
<p>A.4 Parts, Discounts, and Warranties: The Contractor shall provide all replacement parts, materials, and consumables. However, the Government reserves the right to provide the same, if advantageous at any time during the contract. The Government will make the final determination on whether new, new surplus, overhauled, repaired, or serviceable parts will be installed on the aircraft. Parts and components in an "as removed" status will not be installed on the aircraft. Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life but fails inspection and needs to be replaced will be treated as an over and above. Since the government cannot determine which parts or components if any meet this criteria, maintenance contractors shall provide what labor rate they will charge the government, per hour for "over and above" discrepancies. Secondly, contractors are asked to provide what percent discount off list price or the cost plus percentage for replacement parts. Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA) parts are acceptable. The Contractor shall provide the industry standard implied warranty on all products and service.</p>
<p>A.5 Submittal of Invoices: The contractor shall prepare and submit invoices to NOAA/AOC at the address shown in block 15 of the Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items-Standard Form 1449.

Discrepancies that are not a part of the inspection will be known as "over and above." Corrective actions as a result of the inspection are considered "over and above" items. Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life, but fails inspection and needs to be replaced, is considered an "over and above" item.</p>
<p>"Over and Above" discrepancy report must include (as a minimum):<br />&bull; Description of each discrepancy found;<br />&bull; Number of person-hours per discipline required to complete each discrepancy;<br />&bull; Hourly rate for personnel performing the work;<br />&bull; Parts cost less the percentage discount, if any;<br />&bull; Total dollar amount for the complete list of discrepancies.</p>

The Government will pay invoices for "over and above "services out of the funds allocated and authorized on CLIN 0003. This paragraph applies only to CLIN0003. It is not possible prior to contract award to accurately estimate the extent and duration of work or to anticipate costs for CLIN0003 with any reasonable degree of confidence. Time and materials provide for acquiring these services will be on the basis of direct labor hours and cost of materials.</p>
<p>Direct labor hours are at specified fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit. Cost of materials includes appropriate material handling cost as part of material costs. The price to be paid for material shall be based on an established catalog or list price in effect when material or other product is furnished, less all applicable discounts to the Government.

<p><br />C.1 Evaluation Criteria: All contractors that have responded to the solicitation shall be evaluated under the following criteria:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL <br />&bull; Ability to accomplish the corrosion inspection plus scheduled maintenance items listed in Section B for Twin Otter aircraft IAW manufacturer's manual. <br />&bull; Ability to complete all items in required performance period (See D.1 for requirements).<br />&bull; Submitted proof of having maintained or repaired the same model aircraft within the past six months.<br />&bull; Submitted copy of FAA Repair Station Certificate, or Canadian AMO Center documentation.<br />&bull; Submitted proof of insurance documentation (see A.3 for requirements).<br />&bull; Submitted proof of factory trained technicians on staff.<br />&bull; Location of FBO and maintenance facility.<br />&bull; Number of work shifts in a 24 hour day (non-overtime), total service hours per day, and days of operation per week.<br />&bull; Name and location of Contractor's preferred paint shop and price of painting. (See B.2 #1.)</p>
<p><br />FACTOR 2 - PAST PERFORMANCE: Must submit up to three references for recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers, and other relevant information.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, is slightly more important than price. As the technical ratings become more equal, price becomes more important. Conversely, as price proposals become more equal to one another, technical proposals will become a more important determining factor. NOAA will evaluate the offeror's proposed prices for fairness and reasonableness in relation to the solicitation's requirements.</p>
<p>A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C.2 Basis for Award: The Government will evaluate the offer for award purposes on the basis of best value.</p>
<p><br />D.1 Schedule: It is desired that this contract be started on or about October 1st 2010 and that the corrosion inspection along with the discrepancies as well as all scheduled maintenance, repairs, inspections, and upgrades listed in section B will be completed within two months. Actual schedule start and completion dates are to be negotiated between NOAA/AOC, Contracting Officer, and the Contractor.</p>

These projects will help IHS modernize and extend electronic health information technology to improve access, quality, safety, and overall health status of American Indians and Alaskan Natives.  The NextGate software license will provide the management tools to help IHS achieve compliance with mandated federal requirements, including the HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health) Act, the AHIC-Interoperable Nationwide Health Exchange, the Federal Healthcare Architecture, and the HSPD12-HHS Identity associated with evolving criteria for Meaningful Use Electronic Health Record Certification provisions.  

NHIN is a set of standards, services and policies that enable a secure health information exchange over the internet.  NHIN ties together health information exchanges, integrated delivery networks, pharmacies, government, labs, providers, payers, and other stakeholders.  NHIN CONNECT is an open source software package that implements NHIN architecture.  Several federal agencies collaborated to build NHIN CONNECT to tie their health IT systems into NHIN, creating a single solution that can be reused by each agency and that meets federal regulations for health IT interoperability.  NextGate has adapted a functional core component for resell per a provision of NHIN CONNECT regulations.  IHS intends to purchase this product from NextGate because of this core competent modification.  Additional customization will be required with the Data Quality Manager included with the license to work in the IHS environment.  IHS has a unique environment that is particular to its Native American population and special reporting requirements.  NextGate is uniquely qualified for the following reasons:  They are currently developing the schema for IHS MPI project and, therefore, have gained valuable knowledge of IHS unique requirements and systems, including data fields, reports and protocols specific to the Native American population.  NextGate is currently working with IHS on other NHIN and MPI related projects that include the implementation of the NHIN CONNECT Health Information Exchange (HIE) and the Personal Health Record (PHR).  NextGate has worked with federal, tribal and contractor staff on these applications and have established relationships and communications among these various entities.  NextGate knows the challenges working with IHS, including the different types of healthcare facilities that IHS supports.  Health services are provided by IHS to federal, tribal and urban healthcare sites and range from large hospitals to small outpatient clinics in a complicated organization that are included in the MPI and NHIN implementation.  NextGate has comprehensive knowledge of the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS), a patient management database system based on the M programming language using Intersystems Cache database operating system that IHS uses exclusively at their medical facilities.  NextGate has developed messaging capabilities for IHS specifically interfacing between the NHIN, MPI, RPMS and IHS PHR.  NextGate can deliver the software in a timely manner so that IHS can accomplish goals and requirements prior to 9/30/2010.

The contractor shall provide a copy of its standard commercial warranty (if applicable) with this response.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p><strong>Only offers meeting the listed technical capability criteria are eligible for award.</strong></p>
<p>Technical Capability</p>
<p>Quotes shall address in detail the following information as they will be rated against these criteria. The criteria in this section are pass/fail criteria. Only offerors meeting all of these criteria will be considered for contract award.</p>
<p><br />1. FAA Certification:<br />The contractor shall provide verification that they possess a valid and current FAA certification applicable to the services being requested.</p>
<p>2. OEM Procedures:<br />The contractor shall provide verification that they have access to OEM specifications, procedures, and parts.</p>

<p>The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance in accordance with <br />FAR Clause 52.246-15 and in the format specified in the clause.</p>
<p><br />The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">USCG Evaluation of Capability:</span></strong></p>
<p>The offerors selected for contract award will be subject to review and evaluation by the USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) New Product Capability office prior to contract award. Any company found not acceptable will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>Evaluation of vendor's technical capability shall include evaluation by the USCG New Product Development Branch. The evaluation will include in-depth analysis of the vendor's capability to complete the work being solicited to include: facilities, personnel, and associated processes (Quality Control, inventory management, etc.). This evaluation may be accomplished via document reviews and/or a vendor site visit.</p>
<p>Vendors must pass this evaluation in order to be considered for contract award.</p>
<p>This evaluation will only be performed on vendors selected for contract award. Evaluation will be conducted and completed prior to contract award.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Evaluation Criteria:</span></strong></p>
<p>Only offerors successfully meeting these technical evaluation factors listed above will be considered for possible award and evaluated in the following areas. The Government will evaluate quotes based on the following criteria in descending order of importance:<br /><br />1. Delivery<br />2. Past Performance (Relevant and recent)<br />3. Price</p>
<p>Delivery is the most important evaluation factor, with Past Performance being the second most important evaluation factor. Delivery and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price. The closer the offers are to equality, price becomes the most important.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Delivery:</span></strong></p>
<p>The offer must include delivery information IAW the attached Statement of Work. Offerors that can meet the government's required delivery date will be rated higher, with offerors that can meet or excced the government's desired delivery date rated the highest.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Past Performance:</span></strong></p>
<p>The offeror shall provide three (3) past performance references that reflect relevant experience performed within the past five (5) years. Relevant experience includes that which is similar in services provided. The following information shall be provided for each reference listed: Name of Contracting Activity, Contract Number, Contract Type, Contract Amount, Short Description of Work Performed, Contracting Officer and Telephone Number, Technical Point-of-Contact and Telephone Number. Offerors may provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror's corrective actions.</p>
<p>Past performance will be evaluated for relevancy and recency. More relevant past performance will be rated higher with more recent, relevant past performance rated the highest.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating. The Government may also use other information available from Government sources to evaluate an offeror's past performance. The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Price:</span></strong></p>
<p>The contractor shall provide pricing based on the repair of the items documented in the solicitation HSCG38-10-Q-200173. Any quantity price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">X</span></strong>52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Aug 2009)<br />__ (ii) Alternate I (Apr 2002) of 52.212-3.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">X</span></strong>52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data. (Oct 1997) Alternate IV (Oct 1997).</p>
<p>(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required.</p>
<p>(b) Provide information on prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold in the commercial market that is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price for this acquisition. Such information may include: For catalog items, a copy of or identification of the catalog and its date, or the appropriate pages for the offered items. Provide a copy or describe current discount policies and price lists (published or unpublished), e.g., wholesale, original equipment manufacturer, or reseller. Also explain the basis of each offered price and its relationship to the established catalog price, including how the proposed price relates to the price of recent sales in quantities similar to the proposed quantities.<br />(End of provision) <br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p>1.2 Specification 3.5 in Section 3 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
<p>FROM:</p>
<p>3.5 The Raman spectrometer shall include at least 2 gratings blazed at 500 nm to provide different combinations of high spectral resolution(0.5 cm-1 /pixel at 532nm with a 1800g/mm grating) at lower range or lower spectral resolution with greater range (up to at least 3000 cm-1, such as with a 300g/m mgrating). For future near UV work, a resolution of about 1cm-1/pixel with 2400g/mm grating is required. The use of gratings higher than 1800g/mm is not desirable for visible and NIR work, due to the loss of reflectivity at high angles. Smilarly the use of gratings higher than 2400g/mm for NUV is not desireable</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to address the following vendor question and answer:</p>
<p>Question: Why is NIST requiring the capability to perform visible to UV optical interrogation without having to realign or replace optics?<br /><br />Answer: Our goal is to perform optical/electrochemical measurements on a given specimen over a wide wavelength range spanning UV-VIS-NIR. Thus our goal is to minimize any realignment or replacement of optics during experiments, as this will greatly complicate measurements that are time sensitive.</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to address the following vendor questions and answers:</p>
<p>Question 1: Is the Raman instrument supposed to be in an upright or inverted setup?</p>
<p>Answer: Upright Set-up is required</p>
<p>Question 2: Requirements mention I-V characteristics: is this in air or liquid? Is this conductive AFM or electrochemical voltammograms referenced?</p>
<p>Answer: Air and liquid; conductive AFM and electrochemical voltammograms</p>
<p>Question 3: What is NIST's perspective of SECM: there are several interpretations. Is this the AFM based method in which the AFM tip is used purely for imaging the surface in an EC environment, or does the tip take an active electrochemical role? Or is this referring to the non-AFM based SECM method?</p>
<p>Answer: The tip takes an active electrochemical role</p>
<p>Question 4: "The maximum scan range shall be at least 100 &micro;m &times; 100&micro;m. Independent tip positioning with over an area of 10 &micro;m &times; 10 &micro;m is required." Is the requirement for a dual-scanning system in which the sample and tip can both be scanned with piezos, or simply for a 100um scan range (tip or sample)? Some clarifications on the 10um tip positioning is required.</p>
<p>Answer: NIST requires the capability to scan the stage and the tip. The tip should be placed within an area of 10 um x 10 um without having to move the stage.</p>
<p>Question 5: "The liquid media shall include dilute acidic and basic solutions, as well as organic solvents": which solutions exactly?</p>
<p>Answer: The solutions should include 0.1 M HClO4 and 0.1 M KCl etc.</p>
<p>Question 6: Is there an interest in nano-mechanical mapping?</p>
<p>Answer: No</p>
<p>Question 7: What resolution do they want to obtain in the AFM mode?</p>
<p>Answer: In pure AFM mode with Si probes NIST requires a spatial resolution of 0.5 nm; with SECM probes NIST requires 100 nm routine resolution and 30 nm under best conditions</p>
<p>Question 8: Do they want to do TERS or co-located AFM/Raman?</p>
<p>Answer: NIST requires co-located AFM/Raman.</p>
<p>Question 9: What are the samples under study?</p>
<p>Answer: Variety of samples from metal films including Pt and Pt alloys and oxides such as TiO2.</p>

<DESC>The US Dept of Commerce NOAA / ESRL / PSD requires<br />a contractor to prepare a parking pad for a research<br />weather radar North of the end of Flightline Dr,<br />Lincoln, CA 95648.
<p>The exact location of the site is defined by orange<br />cones left by Clark King 2009-11-09. The cones were<br />present 2009-12-04.</p>
<p>There is an existing PG&amp;E underground electrical vault<br />about 350 ft North of the end of Flightline Dr that<br />provides a fixed reference to the site. The approximate<br />GPS coordinates of the vault are<br />38.91503 North, 121.34628 West.</p>
<p>The sides of the site are parrallel to and<br />perpendicular to the existing fence line East<br />of the vault. The fence has a heading of about<br />345 degrees true and is about 70 feet East of<br />the vault.<br />A 12 ft wide driveway about 290 feet long<br />is required. The existing cones that define<br />the driveway are only 10 feet wide and the<br />driveway needs to be 12 feet wide. The<br />driveway parrallels the fence from Flightline<br />Dr for 55 feet, then angles to the center of<br />the South side of the site. We need to be<br />able to get a semi-trailers and cranes to<br />the site.</p>
<p>The site and driveway is to be only slightly leveled<br />and vegitation scraped without digging into the ground<br />or removing much soil. The road base should then be<br />put down over the leveled surface. The scraped<br />material can be put just North of the site.</p>
<p>The site and driveway must also be surrounded hay<br />tubular pads to filter surface run-off.</p>
<p>There need to be three drainage pipes under the<br />driveway, 2 to 3 " diameter, to let any water<br />slowly drain under the driveway. One pipe needs<br />to be near the site, one near the middle of the<br />driveway, and one just North of the bend near<br />Flightline drive. Exact location is not critical.</p>
<p>The compacted road base must be 6 inches deep after<br />compacting. My rough estimate of yardage after<br />the compacting is done:<br />66 ft X 110 ft X 6 inches = 134.4 cubic yards<br />+ 12 ft X 290 ft X 6 inches = 64.4 cubic yards<br />------<br />about 200 cubic&nbsp;yards&nbsp;<br /><br />Amendment&nbsp;3 : Offerors shall acknowledge all three amendments by providing a statement with the proposal</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Questions and Answers pertaining to VA-241-10-RQ-0457, July 15, 2010

1)	QUESTION: Line Item G, estimated workload - Buprenorphine is not listed.

ANSWER: Buprenorphine confirmation volume from Q1& Q2 2010:  0

2)	QUESTION: Do we answer YES to every line item and provide written documentation for Line Items C, D, E?

ANSWER: All offerors must provide a positive response to every line item listed below.  It is up to the vendors how they wish to spell out the written response.  

3)	QUESTION: In the solicitation is states "Please state how your company will track these specimens during transit in your final response." So I assume a "chain of custody" receipt is not required but I just wanted to make sure since we do not do chain of custody but we do track specimen shipping. 

ANSWER:  This is referring to specimen tracking, not chain of custody.

<DESC><p>The Air Armament Center, 708th Armament Systems Group, Eglin AFB FL, will be issuing a contract to support the acquisition of the Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze (HTVSF). The HTVSF is intended to provide a hard target, void sensing fuze capability for use on BLU-109, BLU-113, and BLU 122 penetrator warheads.

The sources cited above should contact Mr. Roger Stevens, Contract Specialist at 850/883-0263 or Mr. Steve Wall, Contracting Officer at 850/883-0844, for technical information, contact Mr. Jason Haynes, Program Manager at 850/883-0819.

When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or source selection process. Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist, or Program Manager. For any other concerns, interested parties may contact or call the AAC Ombudsman, Col. David A. Harris david.harris@eglin.af.mil at 850/882-5422.</p>

Interested parties are cautioned that the draft PWS posted with this notice is subject to change; the formal version of the PWS will be released with the solicitation on a future date. All potential offerors are reminded that in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration (CCR), lack of registration in the CCR will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.

<DESC><p>COCESS - Sources Sought (REVISION 1-PLEASE READ IN ITS ENTIRITY)</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Notice only. No solicitation is being issued at this time. 30 CONS/LGCB is seeking commercial sources with the technical expertise to provide a Contractor-Operated Civil Engineer Supply Store (COCESS) for the 30th Civil Engineer Squadron at Vandenberg AFB, CA. The general description of services is as follows: The contractor shall provide all necessary labor, supervision, equipment, supplies, and materials (except those items identified in the Statement of Work (SOW) as Government-furnished) to support a COCESS located on Vandenberg AFB, CA.

<p>The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code proposed for the requirement is 444130. The size standard for NAICS 444130 is 500 employees. However, offerors are referred to FAR 19.001, Definitions, Nonmanufacturer rule, which impacts an offerors' representation of socio-economic business status (i.e. large business, small business, etc.). Due to the requirements of the application of the nonmanufacturer rule, the Government anticipates this acquisition will be conducted under FAR 6.1, Full and Open Competition. The Government requests interested parties submit a brief description of capabilities, anticipated teaming arrangements, and a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers. Any responses involving teaming arrangements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</p>
<p>Contractors may be afforded a one-on-one opportunity to discuss suggestions, ideas, and comments regarding the proposed acquisition.

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) Center - Fort Bragg, located at Fort Bragg, NC intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP), for an environmental compliance requirement in order to provide services necessary to perform environmental compliance services to meet legal environmental guidance throughout US Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM) and the US Army Environmental Command (USAEC).  The resulting contracts will be designed to support IMCOM and USAEC and will provide contract support services to satisfy the requirements of IMCOM Regional Offices, IMCOM installations, the USAEC, and other organizations (to include the US Army Corps of Engineers) that may require support under this acquisition.  Environmental compliance requirements are broad and include support for all air, water, and hazardous waste management activities.  This acquisition will provide technical assistance to the Army with environmental compliance requirements in five broad categories:  (1) survey, inventory, or investigation, (2) program improvement, (3) sampling and analysis, (4) training, and (5) environmental compliance review.<BR><BR>The Government anticipates awarding multiple indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts to support this initiative.  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation will apply to this acquisition.  One RFP will be issued; however, the Government intends to make awards in two suites:  a restricted suite (set aside 100% for small business concerns) and an unrestricted suite (other than small business).   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services with a size standard of $7.0 million.   The requirement will consist of a 2-year basic ordering period, one 2-year optional ordering period, and one 1-year optional ordering period for a total of a 5-year ordering period.   <BR><BR>MICC Center - Fort Bragg anticipates issuing RFP W91247-09-R-0002 on or around 11 February 2009.  The closing date for submission of proposals will be contained in the solicitation.  Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a government contract, http://www.ccr.gov.

<CONTACT>BRIAN R ROSE, Contract Specialist, Phone 717 770-4673, Email brian.rose@dla.mil - THOMAS F MARTINO, CONTRACTING OFFICER, Phone 717 770-6169, Fax 717 770-5689, Email thomas.martino@dla.mil
<DESC>The Defense Distribution Center (DDC) has a requirement to provide distribution labor services for temporary, intermittent support of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and DDC mission.  The type of services include planning, program management, executing effective and efficient receiving, storage, physical inventory, packaging, care of supplies in storage (COSIS), stock control, stock selection, issue processing, packing, shipping, traffic management support, distribution of material, container fabrication, material processing center (MPC) functions, consolidation and containerization functions, ocean terminal operations, and kitting.  

A contract is required to support excess workload due to surge in order to avoid any degradation to the DDC/DLA mission.  A contract for labor to support workload surges and distribution contingency operations on an as needed  basis would provide for a stop-gap measure for unforeseen, unplanned, situations that the DDCs current workforce cannot absorb with regular work, overtime, reassignment, or temporary or permanent hiring actions.  This contract will provide labor to support workload surges, unforeseen/unplanned workload, contingency operations and special projects.

<DESC>Introduction:  The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate a new area for support of the Missile Defense Agencys (MDA) Educational and Engineering Science Student Outreachs (EESSO) program into the MSTAR BAA, HQ0147-10-MSTAR-BAA.  EESSOs purpose is to expose K-12 students to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields (curricula, programs and activities) in order to increase the number of United States (U.S.) citizens choosing science, math and/or engineering as a career path.  A new submission date for proposals supporting this area is also established.

Under Research Topics, a ninth area is included as follows:
(9) Educational Engineering and Science Student Outreach (EESSO):  Proposals for this area must address the development, implementation and execution of programs and activities in support of the MDAs EESSO program.  Specific program and activity information is contained in the EESSO Program Information attached to this announcement.  This is the only area that we will entertain accepting proposals for other than Advanced Technology Research under the MSTAR program.

For planning purposes, Firm-Fixed Price contracts or grants are anticipated to be awarded for this area.  Although subject to official fiscal appropriation and availability, it is expected that awards for this area to be funded up to an approximately $40,000 level with an anticipated period of performance of up to 12 months (mirroring the school year).  Proposals may include two additional 12 month periods of performance as options at the same anticipated funding level.  Inclusion of options in any award is at the discretion of the Government.  The Government is also not obligated to exercise any option period included in an award. 

If MDA decides to pursue a concept, the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a final proposal will be requested by a MDA Contracting Officer in writing.  Funding of research within MDA areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during the budget cycle.  Therefore, those contemplating submission of a white paper in this area are encouraged to contact the MDA technical point of contact, Educational Outreach Office at 256-313-0587, to determine the likelihood of funding prior to committing resources to preparing a proposal in response to this BAA.  Coordination with the technical point of contact for this area prior to proposal submission allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and avoids educational institution and Government time spent on efforts that may have little chance of being supported.  Potential awards are anticipated to occur in time to support activities in the upcoming school year.

Unless otherwise stated in this announcement or in the attached EESSO Program Information, use the information in the original MSTAR proposal guidelines when preparing and submitting your proposal.  Proposal submission date for submittal of white papers supporting topic area (9) EESSO is established as 25 August 2010.  

Original Posted Announcement Information:
The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is charged with developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States (US), as well as US allies and friends from a ballistic missile attack.  The MDA Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, directed energy systems, battle management, and command control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from Boost and Early Intercept Phases through Midcourse into Terminal Phase.  MDA efforts are focused on making the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and increasing capabilities to handle a broad range of unknown missiles, warheads, trajectories, and adversaries.  MDA must have the ability to detect, track, identify and kill the ballistic missile.

MDA Advance Technology Directorate (DV) instituted the Missile Defense Agency Science and Technology Advanced Research (MSTAR) program to fund relevant advanced research at qualified accredited domestic colleges, universities or institutions of higher learning and to support training of future scientists and engineers in the field of missile defense.  This BAA is a recurring, competitive solicitation and contract vehicle to allow DV to identify and acquire emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and advanced algorithms to improve the BMDS capability and fill technology gaps.  

This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d) (2), which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."  Any contracts awarded from this BAA must comply with the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR).

Proposals are solicited only from eligible domestic accredited colleges, universities or institutions of higher learning registered by the U.S. Department of Education.  Any award resulting from this BAA will be made only to an offeror that is a qualified education institution at time of award.  If the proposal is based on a subcontract or teaming arrangement, the college, university or educational institution submitting the proposal is required to perform 50 percent or more of the effort.  For planning purposes, Firm-Fixed Price or Cost level of effort or completion type contracts are anticipated.  Although subject to official fiscal appropriation and availability, it is anticipated that each MSTAR contract is projected to be funded between $600,000 and $800,000 for a period of two or three years.  Funding ceilings are $300,000 a year during the two year base period of performance with a potential option for a third year of performance funded at a maximum of $200,000.  Inclusion of options in any contract is at the discretion of the Government.  The Government is also not obligated to exercise any option period included in an awarded contract.

MDA requires that lead Principal Investigators of institutions submitting a proposal under this program hold US citizenship. MDA desires that participating students conducting research for or sponsored under this program award, hold US citizenship.  In addition, the Government reserves
the right to request special justification for considering any student who is a non-US citizen, but who holds a valid green card, for participation in research for or sponsored through this program award. Students without valid green cards are ineligible for consideration and participation altogether.

If MDA decides to pursue a concept, the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a final proposal will be requested by a MDA Contracting Officer in writing.  Funding of research within MDA areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during the budget cycle.  Therefore, those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the MDA technical point of contact, Richard Schwarz, MDA/DVI; 256-955-1835, to determine the likelihood of funding prior to committing resources to preparing a proposal in response to this BAA.  Coordination with the technical point of contact prior to proposal submission allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and avoids contractor and Government time spent on efforts that may have little chance of being supported.  Any awards are anticipated to occur in fiscal year (FY) 2010 through FY 2011.

The Government may use selected Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), support contractors, and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information.  Additionally non-government employees must disclose all applicable corporate organizational conflicts of interest as well as any personal financial conflict.  Submission of proposals under this BAA constitutes the offerors acknowledgment and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process.  

The evaluation team will evaluate and make recommendations for award, based on a peer or scientific review process in accordance with FAR 35.016(d) and (e).  The primary basis for selecting proposals will utilize the below listed evaluation factors by applying the delineated criteria as follows: 
&#8195;
EVALUATION FACTORS AND CRITERIA
MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following five technical factors (weighted equally) and a cost evaluation: 

(1) Scientific and technical excellence of the research and its relevance to MDA goals with special emphasis on innovation, originality, and uniqueness; 
(2) The offeror's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; techniques, or unique combinations of these are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; 
(3) Qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and/or key personnel that are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; 
(4) Ability of the proposed effort to make progress toward demonstrating the feasibility of the concept in accordance with MDA programmatic needs; 
(5) Adequacy of management planning and controls; demonstrated ability to deliver results from research projects, on schedule, on or under cost; and

Cost will be evaluated against the government's estimate of the cost of completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed; total evaluated probable cost consists of the government's estimate of the realistic cost of completing the offerors proposals, to include the government's assessment of program risk, and additional costs to the government such as government-furnished property, government-furnished information, transportation, the duplication of previously awarded contracts submitted by the offeror, similar technology efforts pursued elsewhere and other cost related factors.

The following criteria will be applied to each factor for evaluation of each offerors proposal:
(1)  The scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application; 
(2)  The offerors capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and 
(3)  The relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include maturity and level of risk;  
(4)  Demonstrated ability or clear plan to deliver results from research projects on schedule and under cost.  

No further evaluation criteria will be used.  The government intends to evaluate and recommend awards based upon its evaluation of proposals without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to hold discussions and solicit final technical proposal revisions if deemed necessary.  The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.

Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of advanced technology for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution.  Proposals related to the development of a specific system will be returned as non-responsive.  This BAA covers the fiscal year 2010 and 2011 timeframe.  The next response date for proposals submitted is not later than 10 June 2010.  

Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs (to include those proposals selected for award).

<SOLNBR>KC-130T
<RESPDATE>072310
<CONTACT>Sidney G. Galloway, Jr., Contract Specialist, Phone (407)380-8331, Email sidney.galloway@navy.mil
<DESC><strong>THIS RFI IS AMMENDED TO EXEND THE RESPONSE DATE AND CHANGE THE PRIMARY POINT OF CONTACT.&nbsp; SEE BELOW FOR CHANGES.<br /></strong><br />This is a request for information (RFI) only:
<p>The 2F176 is a containerized, non-motion based KC-130T Aircrew Procedures Trainer (APT) used by the United States Navy Reserves (USNR) and the United States Marine Corps Reserves (USMCR), located at the Joint Reserve Base in Fort Worth, Texas. The USNR is considering modification of the visual system and resolving reflective memory card obsolescence.</p>
<p>Currently the system does not support cross cockpit viewing as the viewing point is limited to either the pilot or co-pilot positions rendering the trainer unusable for initial pilot training. In order to address this concern the USN is proposing replacement of the current display system. The current system has a Stewart film screen for the real display system. The system uses three Barco 808 projectors and an ESIG 5330 Image Generator (IG). The trainer has Night Vision Goggle (NVG) capabilities. The USN analysis suggests replacement to a collimated display which allows for cross cockpit viewing by the pilot and co-pilot. The USN has concerns of the resulting performance impact on currently installed projection system and IG given installation of a new display system.</p>
<p>Additionally, the current computational system architecture of Device 2F176 utilizes a reflective memory network to interconnect the Host, IOS (Instructor Operator Station), Blue Ridge Weather Radar and I/O (Input / Output) computational subsystems. The Host is currently running Red Hat 7 and the IOS is running Windows 2000. The Blue Ridge Weather Radar utilizes a generic weather database that does not require correlation with visual database scenery. The USNR has identified reflective memory cards (PCI-5587A, PCI-5588, PCI-5587-110, and VME-5588-210) associated with each of these subsystems as obsolete. The existing Host and IOS computer architectures are supportable and hardware upgrades to these subsystems are not critical. The existing reflective memory cards, associated wiring, software drivers, and application interface software requires replacement and/or modification such that the obsolescence issue is resolved, long term life-cycle supportability is enhanced and the baseline trainer performance is not degraded.</p>
<p>Information Requested. (Request that responses be limited to ten pages.)</p>
<p>Provide a potential design overview and recommended hardware/software solution to deliver real time cross cockpit viewing on Device 2F176 during all phases of flight.</p>
<p>Provide experience in visual system integration, specifically replacement to collimated display system integration and replacement to include experience with structural analysis associated with such efforts.</p>
<p>Provide approach to assess the impact and risks associated with the replacement of the 2F176 display system to other elements of the visual system including the projectors and IG. Assessment shall consider reuse of the currently installed projectors, IG and databases. Additionally the assessment shall provide consideration to ensure that current visual system performance is not degraded as a result of the display system replacement. Identify challenges and technical approach associated with installing a collimated or alternative display within the Device 2F176.</p>
<p>Provide experience with shared / reflective memory solutions implementation, and/or alternate solutions, associated with training systems. Provide recommended hardware/software solution to address the obsolete reflective memory network and enhance the long term life-cycle supportability of the training system. In the event that multiple solutions are offered request that the response include comparisons of life cycle costs of each and trade offs of each compared to the other(s).</p>
<p>Provide approach to satisfy USN Information Assurance (IA) requirements, in accordance with DODI 8500.2 Information Assurance (IA) Implementation, for training system software affected by proposed design to provide the cross cockpit viewing and reflective memory solution.</p>
<p>Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM). Request that the ROM be broken into areas of: display replacement, image generator and projectors, if required, resulting from display system replacement, and reflective memory solution.</p>
<p>Identify the delivery schedule to accomplish the visual display replacement and share memory obsolescence issues. Request that response identify trainer downtime required for in-plant development and to support on-site integration. Schedule should identify requirements for access to Government Furnished Information (GFI)/Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and Government Personnel (Pilots, instructors).</p>
<p>Considering your company's current and projected workload, please describe how your company would provide the necessary staff to accomplish the work identified.</p>
<p>Please list any ground rules and/or assumptions that your company recommends for this effort. As an example: estimated period of performance, availability of government furnished equipment/government furnished information (GFE/GFI), etc.</p>
<p>Please describe your physical capacity for taking on this additional effort, taking into account current workload, and what plans you have if the physical capacity needs to be increased as a result of this proposed effort.</p>
<p>NOTE: This is a request for information only, not a solicitation, or offer to do business of any kind. Any response to this request should be undertaken at your own risk and expense.</p>
<p>To assist interested contractors in their responses, drawings of Device 2F176 are provided as an attachment to this RFI.</p>

***UPDATE:  Amendment 001 has been posted as of June 04, 2010.


The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services at the U.S. Mission Monrovia.  The U.S. Mission Monrovia requires a secure environment to conduct their mission.  The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement.  The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks.  Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government).

All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. 

The Government plans to post the solicitation in this site on or about May 20, 2010.  No paper copies will be mailed.  The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows:  The synopsis will be posted for approximately fifteen (15) days.  Once the solicitation announcement closes on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit proposals.  All dates are subject to change.  Offerors will be notified.
A site visit is tentatively scheduled approximately twenty-one (21) days after the solicitation opens, at the U.S. Mission Monrovia.  A firm date will be announced at the time the solicitation is posted.  Offerors are responsible for entry visa, all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations in Monrovia.  Due to space limitations, only two (2) representatives from each firm will be allowed for the site visit.

Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to Matthew J. Colantonio at ColantonioMJ@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. 



In accordance with 22 U.S.C.  4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.

<a href="mailto:jason.brown5@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  	 THIS NOTICE REPLACES THE PREVIOUS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE PUBLISHED ON FBO 06/14/2019. The VA Medical Center, located in Sheridan, Wyoming,  is seeking the services of a qualified Architectural Engineering (A/E) firm with specialized experience in design through construction period services in Boiler Plant Design for project 666-11-101,  titled "Boiler Plant Design".  The selected A/E firm shall provide all investigative, technical services including architectural, mechanical, structural and electrical engineering as may be required for a boiler plant design.   Design shall include all phasing required during construction.  The project scope is to a complete replacement of existing boilers and all support systems within the boiler plant, including steam piping and accessories, feedwater and condensate transfer pumps, deaerator/feedwater, heater, condensate storage tank, condensate receiver, fuel handling systems, stack and emissions control systems, boiler controls, supporting electrical systems, etc.  This project will also separate 13 of the smaller residential quarters, buildings from the main steam distribution system design will include individual heating systems for each. New boilers will be factory-built packaged steel boilers, fire box, fire tube, water tube or hybrid design, high efficiency in order to meet VA energy mandates per EPACT 2005, EISA 2007 and Executive Orders.  Systems will include stack economizers and other energy saving systems that maximize efficiency.  AE shall select major boiler plant equipment and apply energy-saving systems based on fundamental economic analysis of the application of said equipment and systems.  The existing site steam distribution and condensate return systems may require augmentation to increase capacity to meet the steam load of proposed buildings.  A/E shall analyze the distribution system considering planned building projects to determine requirements for augmentations.  If modifications to the existing boiler plant building are needed for new boilers, such modifications shall be designed to meet the historic building requirements of the Veteran Administration.  Additional space and connection points into emission stream for future carbon capture technology shall also be incorporated in the design and indicated on plans.  The overall intent of this project is to have a new plant with a 30 year life that will not require substantial renovation during that 30 year period with overall plant efficiency above 80%, has low emissions and the potential for carbon capture.  The VA will also consider a design that has the flexibility to mix biomass with coal.  The design load must include additional future loads. Products used in this design must meet the Buy American Act.  Provide professional services including, but not limited to, conceptual design, construction documents and specifications, verification of as-built drawings, accurate cost estimates and construction period services. The designer will also prepare documents and submit applications for all permits required by EPA regulation 40 CFR Part 52.21 (Prevention of significant deterioration of air quality) on behalf of the VA.  They shall also prepare documents and file for all air pollution control permits required for operation of this Boiler Plant. Site investigation of the existing plant must be completed to verify dimensions and current conditions of building and equipment required to support the generation of steam within the plant.  Any existing equipment that is to remain in place and operation must be identified in the report.  Investigation shall also include analysis of the steam distribution system to determine if the pipe sizes must be increased to meet design parameters.  The boiler plant will be designed to meet the VA requirements for redundancy in the number of boilers (VA requires a minimum of three boilers with sufficient excess capacity that loss of the largest boiler leaves the plant capable of meeting full load).  The boilers shall be capable of burning coal to meet design capacity with  natural gas back up.  The existing gas delivery system will need to be evaluated to insure that it will meet the capacity to supply fuel to the boiler plant.  If the selected boiler system will not fit into the existing plant, the design of a new building or addition to the building will be required.  The appearance of this building will be required to meet the standards of the VA and in appearance and construction.  The building is in the National Historical register and all changes must be approved by the Station Historical Preservation Office.  The design shall be done in a manner that the plant remains operational at all times.  The current boiler plant has both summer and winter loads and operates 24 hours per day 7 days a week.  The design contract will require a detailed phasing plan to accomplish work and maintain steam throughout the construction period.  The estimated construction range is between $5.0 and $10.0 million.     

Selection criteria include in descending order importance:     (1)     Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm, both prime and consultants, in design and construction of patient waiting areas and family rooms within a functioning medical center; (2) Past experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for the project working on VA facilities and/or Government facilities; (3) Ability of the firm to begin the work within 30 days of award of contract; (4) Past performance record on contracts with VA facilities and/or Government facilities; (5) Small Business status: Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses will be given the highest score on this criterion, followed in order by Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Small Businesses, and finally Large Businesses; partial credit will be given for demonstrating a subcontracting plan hiring SDVOSB and VOSB subcontractors; (6) Demonstrated success in prescribing the use of recovered materials and achieving waste reduction and energy efficiency in facility design.

<DESC>Research objectives require participants with background in advanced mathematics, quantum mechanics, electrodynamics and non-linear optics, for the development of reliable theoretical and computational tools to be used in the study of the dynamics of high-power phased fiber laser arrays.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />This fixed-price action was not competed; other potential sources (University of New Mexico, University of Arizona and Courant Institute) were either unavailable or could not provide qualified personnel.&nbsp; <br /><br />Given the limited scope and duration of the project, the choice of Acevco Research is in the best interest of the Air Force as measured by competence, overlapping experience, prospects of success in meeting project goals and economic considerations.

<DESC>The 375 AMW Contracting Office intends to issue a sole source contract to Brodart Co. by other than full and open competition, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2). A subscription plan for Adult Books, Children's Hardback Books, and Audio Rental Plan allows the 375 AW library to maintain a current collection of books because the rental gives the 375 AW the option to return books that no longer meet the needs of patrons or are popular for only a short time. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 451211. This is not considered a Request for Quote (RFQ). Brodart Rental Plans are currently in place at the Scott Air Force Base Library and changing to another vendor would cause the government to incur the expense of returning existing books and 2-4 months downtime removing and replacing all records in the catalog database. The proposed sole source requirement will be for the period 1 October 2010 through 30 September 2011 with an additional four option years if needed. All questions should be addressed to Susan Szoke, Contract Specialist, (618) 256-9270, e-mail: susan.szoke@scott.af.mil or Cynthia Woods, Contracting Officer, (618) 256-9268, e-mail: cynthia.woods-02@scott.af.mil. Responses must be received no later than (NLT) 29 July 2010, 1300 EST.

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.  Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, VAPSHCS. 

2.  Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of The NxStage Dialysis Machine, consumables, and customer support for Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT).

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  

NAXSTAGE SYSTEM ONE 	NXSTAGE SYSTEM ONE AGREEMENT NUMBER 2010-A-514                   

FW-200			FLUID WARMER FOR NXSTAGE SYSTEM ONE

PUREFLOW SOLUTION      NXSTAGE PUREFLOW SOLUTION (LACTATE) 
             
PUREFLOW B SOLUTION    NXSTAGE PUREFLOW B SOLUTION (BICARBONATE) 
          
4.  Statutory Authority:  
	( x)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability, or Expert Services;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute;
	(  )  (6) National Security; or
	(  )  (7) Public Interest

5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:   Instead of the traditional 3-4 hour hemodialysis session, CRRT is a continuous therapy which ideally provides treatment 24 hours a day. The NxStage system is the newest generation of machines which is user friendly and the ICU nursing staff will be able to easily learn the system and adopt this therapy in all the critical care units. 

This project will affect the renal dialysis unit and the critical care units. The RDU staff would provide backup and the critical care nursing staff would be the primary user of the machines. A committee including nephrologists, other invited physicians, and nursing staff from the medical and surgical critical care units were involved in the product demonstrations and selection.  After reviewing the products and contacting other facilities, the committee selected the NxStage system due to ease of use, less labor intensive and positive reviews from other programs as compared to the other product competitor. We project that one unit would be required for each of the critical care units. 

6.  Actions to Promote Competition:  The VA Renal Dialysis Unit would be willing to re-evaluate when the ease of use, less labor intensive technology is available from other manufactures. At this time Manufacturers only have modified conventional hemodialysis machines which require intense training and monitoring. 

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:   In accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a)(2), price has been determined fair and reasonable with comparison of the proposed price with pricing found reasonable on previous purchases.

8.  Market Survey (FAR 7.102):  The most recent purchase of dialysis machines was made in 2008 and the approximate cost of the equipment is $20,000. At this time, there are no other vendors that manufacture or sell a self contained, simple to use CRRT Dialysis Machine.  

9.  Other Considerations:  This is specialized equipment for a new renal replacement therapy program proposed for the VA critical care units. This machine allows slow continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) which is an ideal therapy for critically ill patients with acute hemodynamic instability. Traditional hemodialysis is sometimes not possible in critically ill patients with acute renal failure. CRRT is ideal for patients with hemodynamic instability, post surgical patients with volume overload, liver failure patients, extremely catabolic patients, and patients with CHF and oliguria.

1.   CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Consolidated Contracting Activity-VISN 21.

2.   DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:   Purchase Request 570-10-3-444-0017, for McKesson's Horizon Cardiology CPACS and CVIS Cardiovascular Image/information management system.  

3.   DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:   Request is for McKesson's Horizon Cardiology CPACS and CVIS Cardiovascular Image/information management system.  This package is a complete cardiovascular information solution improving image access and delivery across the hospitals network.

The estimated value of this equipment being requested is $312,689.00

4.   AUTHORITY CITED:  FAR 13.106(b) - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirement: "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for."
  
5.   REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED:   Other manufacturers and distributors are not able to provide the combination of features that meets the needs of the customer.  The McKesson CPACS system is the only PACS system on the market that can seamlessly utilize the same central clinical database with the McKesson Hemodynamics Patient Monitoring System which we have already purchased. 

The McKesson Hemo System can export information in both HL7 and XML formats through interfaces to other PACS systems, although this could lead to potential data mismatches or data loss.  Because we are limited to McKesson's Hemodynamics Patient Monitoring system (already purchased), Cardiology's choice of the McKesson's PAC system is the most compatible PACS system.

6.   EFFORTS MADE FOR SOLICITING FROM OTHER VENDORS:  Demos were provided by McKesson, Agfa, and GE.  During this process it was determined that the other companies could not provide proven methods of information connectivity to the Hemodynamics patient monitoring system already procured from McKesson.  This system will facilitate the best possible interface with the patient monitoring system as it is designed and produced by the same company.

7.   FAIR AND REASONABLE COST DETERMINATION:   A Price Negotiation Memorandum (PNM) will detail how the Government has determined that the anticipated costs will be fair and reasonable.   

8.   MARKET RESEARCH:   Market research could not indicate any vendor that could supply the features that the customer was looking for.

9.    SUPPORTING FACTS:  With the addition of the McKesson CPACS system all data will now be captured during the procedure at the point of care thru the McKesson Hemodynamic Monitoring System.

Improving the reliability of the process of capturing data and providing immediate access of images and reports to all Cardiology clinicians ultimately increase the amount of data available for patient diagnosis and leads to better cardiac patient outcomes.

McKesson's unique platform permits acquisition, storage, interpretation, display and management of images, reports, waveforms and information of Cardiac and peripheral catheterization, hemodynamic monitoring, echocardiography, and vascular ultrasound.  It also provides for several levels of access to potentially sensitive information.  Additionally, the recommended system includes a test server that will allow OS patches and software updates to be tested first prior to deploying on the actual VA system in the patient care setting.

This System configuration is set up for to accept images and information from the Cath lab and echo carts. The System has the capability to import CD's of studies and reports of Cardiology patients to add to the patient's record. The system has the ability to store 10 years of data (based on the current study volume).  With the installation of this system, a complete migration/transfer of the VA's current Siemens CPACS Systems reports and image data of VA Patients will be accomplished.   
10.  LISTING OF SOURCES:  There are currently no other sources who have expressed interest in this acquisition.
11.  STATEMENT OF ACTIONS:  As new technology becomes available, review of the current system will be done to see if it can be replaced.  This will be done in sufficient time to facilitate full and open competition. 

12.  CONTRACTING OFFICER:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the J&A are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
