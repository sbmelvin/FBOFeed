<ARCHDATE>10042008
<CONTACT>Donald Hafer, Contracting Officer, 304-285-1390,jodi.collins@netl.doe.gov;Jodi Collins, Contract Specialist, 304-285-1390, jodi.collins@netl.doe.gov

<a href="mailto:jodi.collins@netl.doe.gov">Jodi Collins, Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy TechnologyLaboratory (NETL), intends to issue a full and open competitive solicitation to procure specialized engineering services to perform a design/build requirement for a Fuel Flexible Gasification System.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees.  The Contractor shall provide all facilities, supervision, personnel, tools, equipment, and services to perform the contract requirements (a specified area at the NETL Morgantown, WV site will be available for constructing and testing of the gasification system).
The U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory is developing Coal/biomass co-gasification technology to reduce the overall CO2 emissions associated with Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power production.  Coal/biomass mixture gasification presents many unique challenges.  Individually, coal and biomass gasifiers are not easily adapted to support the co-gasification of coal/biomass mixture materials and define their physical and chemical behavior under high pressure and high temperature gasification conditions.  To accomplish this, the construction of a small-scale, readily operated fuel flexible gasifier is necessary to generate char, tar, slag, and syngas samples to test process concepts, validate computer models, develop diagnostic tools, and screen the relative gasification behavior of coal/biomass mixture feedstocks. 
The objective of this requirement is to have a contractor design a high temperature, high pressure fuel flexible gasification system (designed to the operational parameters provided by DOE/NETL) suitable for kinetic experiments. Upon acceptance of the design elements, the contractor would then be required to fabricate the fuel flexible gasification system, install at NETL-MGN, test and operate the system demonstrating its operational functionality within the specified parameters provided, prepare operational manuals and train DOE/NETL personnel to operate and maintain the gasification system.  The fabrication portion of this requirement would include an expressed warranty/performance guarantee as to the operation of the designed system.
NETL previously posted a sources sought notice on March 18, 2008.  As indicated in that announcement, the following requirements are considered essential to successfully complete this requirement: 
1.  Experience designing continuous gas and solids flow system gasification reactors.
2.  Experience in gasifier design and installation of the gasification system incorporating into existing infrastructure. 
3.  Capability to design the gasification system to achieve high gas and solid feedstock heating rates and demonstrate the high heating rate potential through calculation.
4.  Experience designing the gasification system with an instrumentation and control and data acquisition system. 
5.  Ability to provide pricing and details, as a purchase option, to produce a detailed design of the gasification reactor, but with modification as complete re-circulating transport reactor.  The re-circulating transport reactor shall consist of a transport riser, a cyclone, a stand pipe and a non-mechanical 
valve.
6.  Capability to provide warranty the performance and operation of the gasification system for a period of not less than 1-year commissioning at NETL-MGN.  The warranty shall include, but not be limited to: 1) gasification system performance (e.g., the performance of gasifier sub-systems for gas/liquid feeds, syngas recycle, solids feed systems, achieving and maintaining gasification reactor temperature and pressure, etc.) and 2) sustainable problem and maintenance free operation (e.g., the sustainable long term operation of heaters, reaction tubes, refractory, valves, condensers, etc.)
It is anticipated that the solicitation will be made available for downloading from the IIPS Internet page on or about April 21, 2008 with proposals due on or about May 21, 2008.  The IIPS page is located at http://e-center.doe.gov. At this Internet site you will be able to register with IIPS, enabling you to 
download the solicitation, join the mailing list for the solicitation, submit questions, review responses to questions, and to submit a proposal.  If you need technical assistance in registering of for any other IIPS function, call the IIPS Help Desk at (800) 683-0751 or email the Help Desk personnel at IIPS_HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov.

The minimum and maximum values of individual contract task orders executed under this contract are 500,000 and 50,000,000 respectively.  The first task order may be subsequently identified, negotiated, and awarded with this contract.
b) At the Governments discretion, option periods may be exercised within 365 days of award of the basic contract.  It may be exercised sooner if the total value of task orders awarded under the basic contract reached the limit identified in paragraph 1a.  The total term of the contract inclusive of the option, if exercised, shall not exceed 60 months.
c) Projects will be located at various U.S. installations in Japan.  The majority are expected to be located in the Kanto region.

This criterion must be met by a firm (or one of a firm's joint venture partners) having the Japanese registration entitled "Kaisha Tokibo Tohhon."  Provide registration number, associated dates, and issuing organization.  This criterion is mandatory and a firms submission will not be evaluated if this Criteria Element is not met.
 (2)  Professional Qualifications.  Provide professional qualifications of the firm and staff, including consultants, to be assigned to this contract.  List only the team members who will actually perform the major tasks for these projects.  Include all team members in supporting disciplines such as civil engineering, structural engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, architectural engineering, and fire protection engineering.  Key personnel must have professional registration in their discipline.  Provide license name and issuing organization.  For Japanese licenses, provide this information in both English and Japanese.  Qualifications should reflect each individuals skills and abilities to contribute to the successful completion of task orders on this contract.
 (3) Specialized Recent Experience.  Recent, specialized experience and technical competence of the firm or particular staff members, including consultants, for architectural projects.  Do not list more than ten (10) projects in Column F of the SF 330; projects listed shall have been for the most part completed within the last three years.

 (7) Location in the general geographic area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the projects; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract.
 (8) Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).  Value of contract awards during the previous 12 months will be considered, with the object of affecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not been awarded DoD contracts.

Include the total amount of Prime A-E fees awarded to your firm in the past 12 months by DoD agencies (US Navy, US Army, US Marine Corps, US Air Force).

4. For selection criteria element (5), the Selection Board will review performance evaluations from previous DoD projects performed by each firm.  When available, the Selection Board will also review performance evaluations from private sector projects.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 54171   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Office of Air and Radiation, Clean Air Markets Division, intends to award a sole source fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to  MassachusettsInstitute of Technology (MIT) under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1). The purpose of this acquisition is to complete the development of an integrated analysis framework supporting Smart Trading. The NAICS Code for this procurement is  541742.  The study, "Time-Differentiated NOx Emissions Control, Ozone Forecasting, and the Value of Information:  the Development of an Integrated Analysis Framework" is in it's third year .  The first two years were undertaken as an Interagency Agreement (IAG) (Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) DW-13-92202401) to develop an integrated analysis framework using a tradeable permit system for the electric utility industry and incorporating time-varying ozone forecasts into its design in order to reduce compliance costs and increase attainment with the ambient ozone standard.  The completion of this study will allow EPA to analyze the scientific basis and policy value of an integrated analytical framework for a tradeable permit system that incorporates time-varying ozone forecasts into its design to reduce compliance costs for the electric utility industry while also increasing attainment of the ambient ozone standard.  MIT in conjunction with its associates at the University of Texas, Austin, provide expertise in the latest methodologies for meteorological forecasting, so high ozone episodes can be predicted in advance. These advance predictions will, in turn, improve EPA's ability to estimate the value of such information in the design of an emission trading programs that provides incentives for greater NOx emission reductions during the day or hours of an ozone episode.  Over the past two years, MIT has made significant progress in exploring the necessary preconditions for a forecast-based time- and location-varying NOx permit trading system for the eastern U.S.   NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Debra Miller at the following email address: miller.debbie@epa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)<BR>Sources Sought Notice<BR>Recruiting Services<BR><BR>BACKGROUND<BR><BR>The Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) Mid-Atlantic Region (MAR) is seeking an interested, experienced recruiting firm to assist the Human Resources (HR) department with recruiting graduating college business and accounting majors from among 100 +/- colleges, universities, and career consortia within the northern mid-Atlantic geographic areas of: southwest New York, Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, northern Virginia, and the District of Columbia. <BR><BR>Statement of Objectives (SOO)<BR><BR>General Recruiting Objectives:<BR><BR>Contractor support services will generally include DCAA-partnering efforts such as: 1) coordinating job and career fairs on college and university campuses and among business, industry, and Federal government  recruitment consortia, 2) acting as liaison between and among the colleges and universities professors, department heads, deans, provosts, career center directors., etc., and DCAAs HR recruitment personnel, 3) maintaining DCAA website presence linked with each colleges and universitys career center, accounting department, employer partner website, etc., 4) scheduling designated DCAA auditors and managers as part of DCAAs Adopt-a-School program to participate as guest speakers at accounting club meetings, in classroom discussions, in faculty plenary sessions, in on-campus interviews, etc. A more detailed list of recruiting objectives is outlined in each of the individual specific SOO below.<BR><BR>Specific Recruiting Objectives:<BR><BR>* Partner with DCAA in supporting the development and sustainment of a meaningful, in-depth relationship with each designated college, university, and career fair consortium. Grow the relationship and name recognition among faculty, academic advisors, career center professionals, accounting department chairs, business department deans, etc. Grow the relationship and name recognition among student organizations that support the interests and concerns of the accounting and business students, such as accounting clubs, professional accounting associations, ethnic accounting organizations, veterans and service disabled veteran groups, physically challenged interest groups, etc. The goal is to have a consistent footprint on campuses and successfully compete with the best private accounting firms for top quality accountants.<BR><BR>* Partner with DCAA to educate faculty members and students on the basic aspects of federal careers, including salary and benefits (health, life insurance, retirement, leave, holidays, quality or work life, paid overtime, etc.). Educate students on DCAA incentive programs (student loan repayment, recruiting bonuses, relocation incentives, retention allowances, awards, etc.). Educate students on the specifics of the DCAA career paths; General Schedule (GS) grade increases from GS-5/7/9 thru GS12 full performance, GS-13 Technical Specialists, Y-pay band supervisory positions, etc. <BR><BR>* Partner with DCAA to develop a multi-tiered messaging campaign at career events for faculty and students aimed at getting all to understand what federal opportunities look like and how they compare with other private-sector positions (i.e., long hours in the private sector vs. 40-hour work week with the Fed, plus rapid advancement, serving ones country, etc.). <BR><BR>* Coordinate with local DCAA offices to schedule auditors as guest speakers, presenters, fair participants, etc., to create and present a Face to the faculty and students. Manage the Adopt a School program at DCAA and create new, innovative ways to involve local auditors in on-campus interviewing opportunities.<BR><BR>* Partner with DCAA to market the concept that DCAA as an organization with a culture of change, and that new accountants/auditors joining the organization will be a big part of this change; moving DCAA in a continuously improving mode.<BR><BR>* Link DCAA websites to those of college, university, and consortia websites that host accounting and business employment opportunities. Upload DCAA factual information onto college and university websites.<BR><BR>* Partner with DCAA to reach students and faculty where they are: conduct interventions and events, tailor information to the specific audience-backgrounds and skills, involve alumni (as available) who work at DCAA, encourage interaction, use private sector tricks of the trade when practicable.<BR><BR>* Partner with DCAA in utilizing Career Centers (CCs) to the maximum. Coordinate recruiting efforts leveraging CC professionals and the established framework of each college and university.<BR><BR>* Partner with DCAA to enlist and educate faculty and staff as communication allies to pass the word of DCAA. Establish a quick reference guide on faculty and student intranet sites to provide current up-to-date recruitment and career opportunity information. <BR><BR>* Partner with DCAA to tailor all recruitment marketing to appeal to various ethnic, under-represented, and challenged people groups.<BR><BR>* Stress professional benefits-reimbursement for CPA, completion of graduate degree, related training for CEUs, etc.<BR><BR>* Partner with DCAA to promote DCAAs Student Career Experience Program (SCEP).<BR><BR>* Other marketing and recruiting requirements as defined by market conditions, geographic, demographic and psychographic population characteristics.<BR><BR>DCAA Marketing and Recruiting Strategies Accounting Majors/Graduates<BR><BR>INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND<BR><BR>To adequately fill immediate and long-term auditor needs, DCAA Mid-Atlantic Region (MAR) must successfully recruit top graduates from colleges and universities within the MAR. To reach this Millennial generation of graduates, DCAA must conduct personal outreach instead of relying solely on technology and drive-by recruiting actions, a.k.a. job/career fairs (only).<BR><BR>In the Scott Research Group survey study, The Class of 2005 Speaks Out on Current Recruitment Practices, graduating seniors from 15 selected universities were asked to rank responses to three groups of job decision factors: IMPORTANT JOB SELECTION FACTORS, SOURCE OF RECRUITMENT INFORMATION, and AT CAREER FAIRS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME THAT COMPANIES&.<BR><BR>Group ONE: Graduates were asked to rank (1-10; 1 = most important) factors for job selection. Job Content (avg. 3.42) and Fit with the company culture/environment (avg. 4.0) were the two most important factors involved in their job selection decision making.  NOTE: Salary was third most important (avg. 4.19), but benefits and job security were ranked near the bottom of the selection factors (avgs. 6.04 and 6.36, resp.).    <BR><BR>Group TWO: Graduates were asked to rank (1-10; 1 = most important) preferred sources of recruitment information. Company Representative (avg. 3.05) and Information Sessions (avg. 3.64) were the two most important recruiting contacts.<BR><BR>Group THREE: Graduates were asked to rank (10-1, 10 = strongly agree) the important aspects of a job/career fair. Company willing to take time to answer questions (avg. 9.44), Company  providing information regarding specific employment opportunities (avg. 9.16), Company accepting a hardcopy of a rsum for review (avg. 8.91) and Company represented by impressive staff (avg. 8.44) were the top four responses.<BR><BR>The Millennial graduates prefer to use Internet technology (high-tech) to find detailed information, but rather prefer to turn to influencersprofessors, advisors, parents, and friends, (high-touch) to assist them in their career decision-making process. Employers must understand this high-tech/high-touch approach when recruiting graduates. These involve much more than just drive-by participation in job/career fairs. It involves a consistent long-term partnership with colleges and universitiesprofessors, deans, department heads, provosts, career center directors, etc. <BR><BR>With companies experiencing double-digit growth in college campus recruiting, competition for a limited number of talented graduate accountants is likewise increasing rapidly. Graduates are bombarded with options. As a result, graduates have become increasingly reliant upon advice from othersmentors, career veterans, alumni, etc. The prospective employer who is a face to the graduatesbranded recognitionhas a much better opportunity to bring talented accountants/auditors onboard than does an obscure employer with little or no recognition on campus among the various accounting organizations, departments, or career center.<BR><BR>Recruitment research results from the Partnership for Public Service, Call to Serve, found several key roadblocks to recruiting graduates into the Federal government.<BR><BR>ONEStudents and faculty do not outright reject federal careers. (42% surveyed would consider a federal job). Rather, students and faculty are simply not educated about federal employment and career options that are available. Lack of this information is the single greatest barrier to a graduate pursuing a federal career.<BR><BR>TWOStudents indicated overall that positive aspects of a federal job far outweigh the negatives, suggesting that the more they learn about the professional and altruistic benefits of federal careers, the more acceptable they would be of a job offer. In other words, the more they know, the more they like the prospects of working for the federal government.<BR><BR>THREEBureaucratic Red Tape is the single most negative perception of entering a Federal government career. <BR><BR>FOURHigh-Touch is as important as High-Tech. Personal network connections, especially among faculty, career advisors, department heads, etc., are crucial to the graduates career decision-making process. The more the college faculty and staff know about the employer (branding) the better they will be able to communicate and sell Federal government careers.<BR><BR>FIVEOne size does not fit all. Having employer representatives go to the students (i.e., guest speaker, on-campus interviewer, club presenter, etc.) helps to make the students feel pursued and valued. This appeals to the Millennial student.<BR><BR>SIXTeach the teachers. The college faculty and staff can be the best sales people for a Federal agency. So, spend time educating the schools professors, career counselors, etc. Agency personnel need to be ready to reach out and touch all members within the school. Be a face (real person) to the faculty and staff.<BR><BR>SEVENStudents of diverse cultures need a tailored outreach. Values are diverse. The outreach must focus on the benefits that best fit the value system of the individual student/graduate.<BR><BR>In summary, MAR DCAA must do a better job of recruiting if we hope to compete effectively with the private Big Four and other Federal agencies. But, if we market ourselves aggressively and consistently we can and will attract the top-level talent of accountants/auditors we need to Get er Done!<BR><BR>TARGET MARKETS<BR><BR>The Target Market is a defined segment of the market population upon which business efforts are focused and a market plan is developed. The Target Market is often defined in terms of the common geographic, demographic, and psychographic characteristics or propensities of the targeted population. <BR><BR>The target populations in this market plan are:<BR><BR>1. Primary<BR>a. current juniors and seniors majoring in accounting or business-related disciplines, having at least 24-semester hours of accounting courses <BR>b. alumni accounting majors.<BR><BR>2. Secondary<BR>a. Business Department Dean,<BR>b. Accounting Department Chair,<BR>c. Business & Accounting Professors,<BR>d. Provost, President, Vice President,<BR>e. Career Center Director and Staff<BR>f. Student Advisors/Counselors.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Primary Target Market<BR><BR> MAR DCAA will develop and sustain meaningful, in-depth relationships with students, graduates, and alumni of  select Mid-Atlantic Regional colleges and universities, moving beyond a drive-by recruiting at career fairs modus operandi to a branded presence on campuses via working in an Adopt-a-School environment with student organizations, professional clubs, ethnic groups, etc. This relationship building will prime the pump for MAR DCAA when we make our recruiting pitches at career fairs, on-campus interviews, presentations, workshops, etc. To enable us to do this, we will&<BR><BR>ONE: Communicate the details of the DCAA auditing experience and working within in the Federal government. Invite students, graduates, and alumni to learn more at information sessions, workshops, presentations, etc. Facilitate learning about pay and benefits, retention incentives, career pathways, global opportunities, advancement, etc. <BR><BR>TWO: Communicate the opportunities to do good and do well. Compare DCAA career benefits with those of the private sector. Stress a work that matters; serving ones country, relevance of the work, practical advantages of working with DCAA, etc. <BR><BR>THREE: Cut through the Red Tape. Be a face to the students. graduates, and alumni and help them cut through all the bureaucratic holdups to hiring.   <BR>Secondary Target Market.<BR><BR>Secondary Target Market<BR><BR>MAR DCAA will develop and sustain meaningful, in-depth relationships with college and university interveners; professors, deans, staff, etc. DCAA will teach the BAs/BSs, MBAs/MSAs, and PhDs about DCAA and the elementary aspects of federal careers. DCAA will maximize Career Centers as repositories of information and career advice. We will utilize the college and university faculty and staff to market DCAA careers as our partners to develop a win-win-win experience; a win for the student/graduate, a win for the school, and a win for DCAA. To enable us to do this, we will&<BR><BR>ONE: Expand direct marketing to educate and train the influencers, mentors, and advisors of students and graduates in their career choices. This establishes a communication network through which talented accounting/auditor candidates can find DCAA as a name-recognized (branded) employer. <BR><BR>TWO: Establish open channels of communication with faculty and staff whereby DCAA auditors are invited to speak to students at various events, increasing the footprint of DCAA on campus as a know, familiar employer.  <BR>Recruiting Process Model<BR><BR>Career Fair Event Selection<BR><BR>* DCAA (or Contractor) provides potential leads.<BR><BR>* DCAA determines if recruiting event is worthwhile attending.<BR><BR>* DCAA issues Task Order (TO) against the contract for the event under a unique Career Intern Program (CIP) announcement number.<BR><BR>Career Event Planning and Set-up<BR><BR>* Contractor makes all arrangements to coordinate, attend, and set up (as needed) for career fair recruiting events.<BR><BR>* DCAA provides as Government Furnished Material (GFM): display stand, table cloth, take-aways, advertising packets, CDs, application forms, etc.<BR><BR>* Contractor provides two (2) trained recruiters* to present at each recruiting career fair event1. <BR><BR>*Each contractor recruiter must complete a DCAA recruiter training orientation, which outlines required topics to present to prospective applicants.<BR><BR>1 Contractor will not provide trainers to events where DCAA auditors will act as guest speakers, lecturers, on-campus interviewers, or presenters. The Contractor will only be responsible for coordinating the schedule with a local FAO and the college/university Point of Contact (POC).<BR><BR>* Contractor will instruct applicants to upload rsums, transcripts, and other pertinent documentation onto the proper USAStaffing website2.<BR><BR>Post-Career Event Processing<BR><BR>* Contractor will perform all follow-up communications with prospective applicants to ensure their rsums, transcripts, and other needed documentation is properly uploaded into USAStaffing.<BR><BR>* Contractor will complete all applicants postings within thirty (30) days after the CIP announcement closes.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Notional Concept<BR><BR>DCAA MAR anticipates that any resultant contract will be a performance-based, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ, with five one-year options), service contract, under which a separate Task Order (TO, by CIP announcement number) will be issued per recruiting event.<BR><BR>For estimating purposes, the following minimum and maximums (per school year) may be considered.<BR><BR>Minimum50 career recruiting events  <BR>Maximum150 career recruiting events<BR><BR>Minimum250 qualified applicants<BR>Maximum500 qualified applicants<BR> <BR>NOTE: For planning purposes, recruiting events normally occur during the months of September thru November and February thru June of each school year. However, the coordination of guest speaker engagements et al, may occur at anytime throughout the school year.<BR><BR>DCAA desires a firm-fixed pricing (FFP) unit price per career recruiting event to which the Contractor must travel and attend. A separate FFP unit price is expected for coordinating events that DCAA auditors will attend as guest speakers; ones to which the Contractor will not be required to travel and attend.<BR>  <BR>At a minimum, the following metrics will be used to determine a Contractors success in performing recruiting services.<BR><BR>1.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Atmospheric Turbulence and Diffusion Division located in Oak Ridge, TN intends to purchase one (1) Tekran Model 2537B, Continuous Mercury Vapor Analyzer, equipped with Option 1, Internal Permeation Source on a sole source basis from Tekran Instruments Corporation based on the following: 1) The office of Atmospheric Turbulence and Diffusion requires a total gaseous mercury sensor to provide continuous mercury vapor concentrations with an ambient air detection limit of 0.1ng (Hg)/m3. This sensor must operate unattended and be self calibrating from an internal permeation mercury vapor source, or equal method; 2) Sensor needs to conform to or be equal to EPA Method IO-5 "Sampling and Analysis of Vapor and Particulate Phase Mercury in Ambient Air Utilizing Cold Vapor Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry"; 3) The Tekran 2537B is a continuous mercury vapor analyzer with an air detection limit of 0.1ng(Hg)/m3, in addition the sensor is capable of unattended operations and is self calibrating from an internal permeation mercury vapor source traceable to the NIST standard; 4) The Tekran 2537B conforms to EPA Method IO-5; 5) The Tekran 2537B Total Gaseous Mercury Sensor is required in the written site operations manual of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP; a consortium of NOAA, EPA, USGS, and Universities) for measurement of atmospheric mercury concentrations. The NADP program would reject data collected and submitted to the national archive if the mercury were measured with any other sensor. This requirement is in place so that all NADP sites (including NOAA's three sites) are instrumented identically and follow identical procedures; 6) The NADP collects data on the chemistry of air and precipitation for monitoring of geographical and temporal long-term trends. All measurements and collections are conducted according to strict procedures. NADP expanded to include mercury measurements in precipitation in 1995, and gaseous mercury measurements in 2006; 7) The NADP requires the use of the TEkran 2537B sensor for all gaseous mercury measurement because the Tekran Model 2537B provides continuous analysis of total gaseous mercury in air at sub-ng/m3 (parts per trillion (ppt) and parts per quadrillion (ppq)) levels. The instrument samples air and traps mercury vapor onto patented cartridges containing an ultra-pure gold adsorbent. The amalgamated mercury is thermal desorbed and detected using Cold Vapor Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry (CVADS). Dual cartridge design allows alternate sampling and desorption resulting in continuous measurement of mercury in the air stream

<DESC>IntroductionThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Launch Services Program (LSP)invites you to submit a response to this inquiry to assist in the expeditious developmentof an approach to continue to provide the Agency with Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV)launch services.  LSP serves as the Agencys provider of domestic expendable launchservices and advisor on expendable launch systems.  LSP oversees mission integration,mission analysis, launch vehicle production, and down range telemetry assets at variousdomestic and international locations.  The program manages launch site activities at theCape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) and Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB). Additionally, the program supports, when necessary, launches from other locations such asKodiak, Alaska, Kwajalein Island, and the Wallops Flight Facility.Currently, NASA Launch Services (NLS) contracts provide domestic launch services for NASAand NASA-sponsored payloads on a multiple award indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity(IDIQ) basis (NLS Request for Proposal (RFP) RFP10-0021, Revision C).  NLS providescontinuous competition via the Launch Services Task Ordering Procedures employed for eachlaunch service acquired (NLS RFP Section C, Clause 14.0).  In addition, NLS has aninnovative on-ramp provision (NLS RFP Section C, Clause 2.0) to accommodate proposalsubmissions every six months from new launch services providers desiring to obtain an NLScontract and from existing NLS contractors desiring to provide additional launchservices.  To date, contracts have been awarded to Boeing Launch Services, Inc., LockheedMartin Commercial Launch Services, Inc. and Orbital Sciences Corporation.   Selection foraward of NLS contracts is determined by NASA in accordance with the evaluation criteriaspecified in NLS RFP Section E, Attachment E-3.The ordering period under NLS expires in June 2010.  In preparation for the impendingexpiration of NLS, NASA seeks information from industry to assist in addressing issuesaffecting the Agencys overall strategy for launching NASA spacecraft on launch vehiclesfrom U.S. commercial providers of launch services, consistent with current law andpolicy.  The information will facilitate acquisition planning for future procurements. The primary purpose of this RFI is to collect information on key parameters that willhelp NASA refine and mature the acquisition plan for procuring safe, timely, costeffective, and reliable launch services beyond those in the current NLS RFP/contracts.Mission Model AssumptionsFor the purpose of assessing post-NLS launch service needs, NASA is considering themission model attached to this Request for Information.  Acquisition Approach As previously stated, NLS has a valid ordering period through June 2010.  NASA isconsidering a number of possible NLS follow-on procurement strategies, including (but notlimited to):o	Extend the current NLS contract and ordering periodo	Establish a new NLS follow-on contract(s)o	Forgo the August 2008 and/or subsequent on-ramp periods  in deference to thepending acquisition o	Volume buy(s) of a set(s) of missions. NASA may award multiple contracts for the requirements described in this RFI based on thebest competitive solution provided by industry.  RFI Requested Response TopicsThe objective of this RFI is to solicit information from industry that could potentiallyenhance NASAs approach for the NLS follow-on acquisition.  Comments are requested, butnot limited to, any of the following topics:(1)  Technical CapabilityResponders are invited to provide information regarding launch services capabilities forany single mission, group of missions or the entire set of missions that meet therequirements defined in the attached mission model. a.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR ACCESS CONTROL POINT A-E SERVICES<BR><BR>1. QUESTION:  Under the Submission Requirements of the subject solicitation, it states that the total SF330 shall not xceed 50 pages, including no more than five (5) pages for Section H.  It then goes on and states that SecTion H should include the firm's overall design quality management plan as well as estimated percentage of involvement of each firm on the proposal.<BR> <BR>Traditionally, Section H is where A/E firms specifically address the selection criteria.  In particular, for this competition, there are six qualification factors to address here, requiring sufficient space.  Our experience is that Section H is the largest part of the SF330, ranging from 17-20 pages. <BR> <BR>Is it possible that there was an error in limiting Section H to five pages?  Could the requirement be revised, removing the limit to Section H, but restricting the overall SF330 to 50 or less pages?<BR><BR>1.  ANSWER:  Five pages is correct.  We are looking for succinct and direct narratives characterizing the qualifications.<BR><BR> <BR>2. QUESTION: Is a Security Clearance required for this solicitation? If Yes, what level and will it be a DoD security clearance? <BR><BR>2. ANSWER:  Previous work has not required any security clearances. It is not anticipated that any classified information will be disseminated during the course of the contract.<BR> <BR>    <BR>3. QUESTION:  Could you tell me if these services are currently being performed by contractors? If so, could you please provide the incumbent names as well as the contract numbers?<BR><BR>3. ANSWER:  Shearer and Associates (W912DY-05-D-0022) currently provide programmatic support for ACP however, they do not provide the same services that are required by this contract.  To date, the Electronic Security Systems (ESS) and the Facilities Repair and Renewal (FRR) contracts have been used for fulfilling these requirements.  Requests for information concerning these contracts must be requested through the Freedom of Information Act point of contact, Lisa Gayman at (256) 895-1107.    <BR><BR>Contractors for the ESS contracts are as follows:<BR><BR>W912DY-05-D-0017                            <BR>Cirrus Technology Inc.<BR><BR>W912DY-05-D-0018<BR>SEI Group Inc.<BR><BR>W912DY-05-D-0019<BR>LVW Electronics<BR><BR>W912DY-05-D-0020<BR>Government Technical Services, LLC<BR><BR>W912DY-05-D-0021<BR>Infotec Systems Corporation <BR><BR>W912DY-05-D-0013<BR>Williams Electric Company Inc.<BR><BR>W912DY-05-D-0014<BR>Johnson Controls Bldg Sys, LLC<BR><BR>W912DY-05-D-0015<BR>Siemens Government Services<BR><BR>W912DY-05-D-0016<BR>Northrop Grumman Technical Services Inc.<BR><BR>W912DY-05-D-0027<BR>Infotec Systems Corporation (Small Business)<BR><BR>W912DY-03-D-0024<BR>Black and Veatch <BR><BR>Contractors for the FRR contracts are as follows:<BR><BR>W912DY-03-D-0004<BR>RCI, Inc.<BR><BR>W912DY-02-D-0035<BR>BMAR & Associates, LLC<BR><BR>W912DY-03-D-0006<BR>Vanguard Contractors, LLC<BR> <BR>W912DY-03-D-0007<BR>Ameresco Solutions, Inc. <BR><BR>W912DY-03-D-0005<BR>Global Engineering & Construction, LLC  <BR><BR><BR>4. QUESTION:  We would like to know if we can find out who were the individuals that held this contract the last time it was available for bid. I would like to know how we can obtain this information under the Freedom of Information Act.<BR><BR>4. ANSWER:  See answer to Question #3.  <BR><BR><BR>5.  QUESTION: The RFP states that you will be selecting 3-5 companies to be part of this contract. Will each company be selected from a separate region, since this will be a nation wide implementation?<BR><BR>5.  ANSWER:  The market research showed that those proposing would be able to offer national services and the intent is to award to companies on a national rather than regional basis.<BR><BR>  <BR>6. QUESTION:  Will each of the five vendors require exactly the same skills and qualifications to meet all specifications or can each company specialize in a specific area, such as Access controls systems, or Design, etc&?<BR><BR>6. ANSWER: The selected vendors will need to offer a complete skill set sufficient to perform the entire scope of work.  The vendor may do this through teaming arrangements, subcontracting, etc.  However, in accordance with FAR 52.219-14, for a Small Business set-aside such as this, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.    <BR><BR><BR>7. QUESTION: Will there be five separate contracts, if five companies are selected or will it be a blanket contract and all five will be allocated a certain amount of work? <BR><BR>7. ANSWER:  There will be five separate awards to five companies.  The shared capacity between the five awardees will be an estimated $12 million for the base year and options.  Task orders will be awarded to the awardees in accordance with FAR 16.505. <BR><BR><BR>8. QUESTION:  Can a company respond to part of the RFP where that area may be their specialty or does each company need to meet all requirements based on the RFP?<BR><BR>8. ANSWER:  See Answer to Question  #6.<BR><BR>

<p>Statement of Work to Purchase Factory-New Pratt and Whitney PT6A-27 Turbine Engine for Installation on DHC-6-300 Aircraft</p>
<p>Introduction: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Aircraft Operations Center (NOAA AOC) owns/operates four deHavilland DHC-6-300 Twin Otter aircraft. These aircraft are powered by eight Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada (Part Number PT6A-27) Fed stock number (2840-21-860-1455) engines which are maintained and operated by AOC and contract maintenance personnel. NOAA AOC DHC-6 Twin Otters serve as survey platforms for a multitude of important scientific missions including Coastal Mapping, Northern Right Whale Surveys; Air Quality and Ozone research; Sea Turtle Abundance Surveys; Polar Ice Estimate surveys; Post Hurricane damage assessment surveys and many more. These programs are an integral part of NOAA's strategic mission and commitment to the nation to understand and predict changes in Earth's environment and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our Nation's economic, social, and environmental needs. The four Twin Otter aircraft fly more than 2600 hours combined each year in support of these programs in locations extending from the Sea of Cortez, Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. It is the intent of NOAA AOC to purchase a factory new PT6A-27 engine in order to reduce overall costs of rental engines during engine changes, decrease maintenance down periods, increase mission efficiency and above all increase safety.</p>
<p>A. Scope: NOAA AOC intends to purchase one factory new, zero time Pratt and Whitney Canada gas turbine engine Part Number PT6A-27, Fed Stock Number 2840-21-860-1455 to furnish NOAA AOC's Dehavilland DHC-6-300 Twin Otter Aircraft. The engine shall meet all the standards and certifications set forth by the Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada Engine Manufacturer.</p>
<p>A1. Technical Requirements: NOAA AOC requires that all applicable Service Bulletins, Service Letters, Airworthiness Directives, and any other inspections pertaining to the PT6A-27 be complied with prior to purchase. NOAA AOC requires a complete description of engine warranty services, engine specifications, test cell documentation, inspection documentation and certifications and the name, address, and certification of the inspector. In addition, NOAA AOC requires proof of compliance with all Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification including Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) and Type Certificate Data Sheets (TCDS) for the make and model of engine prescribed above. The engine will serve as a spare engine for one of the eight PT6A-27 engines operated by the NOAA AOC DHC-6 Twin Otter fleet. The engine will be kept in short term storage at AOC in Tampa, Florida until it is required for service.</p>
<p>A2. Delivery Requirements: NOAA AOC requires the engine be available for delivery no later than 12 months from the date of contract award.</p>
<p>A3. Quality Assurance: NOAA AOC may request to have a representative witness any part of this contract. The contractor shall keep the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) apprised of the progress and schedule.</p>
<p>A.4. Submittal of Invoices: Contractor shall submit invoices to the Aircraft Operation Center at the Address shown in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 - Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL INFORMATION: The following technical information is to be provided.</p>
<p>a. Statement that contractor has complied with Pratt and Whitney PT6A-27 Build Specifications (Spec Number 583) or comparable Spec Number. Any additional equipment, accessories, protective coatings provided over and above the standard Build Spec will be given higher evaluation ratings.</p>
<p>b. Provide Engine Warranty documentation and terms; engine specifications and test cell documentation.</p>
<p>c. Provide documentation of compliance with applicable Manufacturer certifications <br />and FAA airworthiness certifications for engines and accessories including documentation of Type Certificate Data and Technical Standard Orders (TSO) for auxiliary power units, applicable Service Bulletins, Service Letters, and any applicable Airworthiness Directives, inspection documentation, certifications and the name, address and certification of inspector.</p>
<p>d. Factory new engines will require additional labor to "build up" the engine in preparation for installation on the airframe. As an option, provide additional cost for building up the factory new engine with equipment such as wiring harnesses, engine baffling, and any accessories to make it available as a Quick Engine Change (QEC). Quote shall list equipment included in "build-up".</p>
<p>e. Documentation that protective anti-corrosive coating will be provided on the engine for operations in the marine environment.</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE: Provide up to three references of providing similar type engines, to include contract number, name address and point of contact with phone number.</p>
<p>PRICE: Prepare pricing in accordance with the line items in this announcement.</p>
<p>The evaluation of quotes will be conducted as a commercial item acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 12. The evaluation of quotes shall be based on the offeror's responsiveness to the item listed, offeror's price proposal and the offerors ability to exhibit an understanding of the requirements included in this RFQ. The Government will award the purchase order to the contractor that represents the best value for the work. All responsible offerors may submit a response to this notice that will be considered by the agency.</p>

HSAR 3052.209-70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUNE 2006).  (a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.  Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)  (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.  (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;  __ it is a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73, but it has submitted a request for waiver pursuant to 3009.104-74, which has not been denied; or __ it is a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73, but it plans to submit a request for waiver pursuant to 3009.104-74.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

"ENCLOSURE:  Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, 
Notice for Filing Agency Protests, is included with this solicitation.
Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation and Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) for a software license renewal for the IBM Unidata software maintenance under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This will be in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on HTC711-08-Q-0143.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24, dated 28 February 2008.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541511 and the small business size is $23M.  

IBM Corporation is the only known supplier of IBM Unidata software maintenance as required by the Surface Cargo Systems Branch of HQ Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), Global Freight Systems (GFM).  The IBM Unidata software is a proprietary product of IBM Corporation.  There are no similar products available through other companies. This acquisition is for technical support for the IBM Unidata.  IBM Unidata has been a critical COTS component of GFM since its start in the late 80s.  At the core of GFM are the UniData database engine and about 400,000 lines of UniBasic Software Lines of Code (SLOC).  While GFM can operate in an extremely limited fashion without the presence of UniData and UniBasic, it would not be able to operate its core functionality.  Based on the market research, no company other than IBM Corporation can provide the necessary software products for the requirement.  SDDC provided Justification and Approval (J&A) states that GFM can not function without IBM Unidata, and that not using Unidata would incur massive costs, risks, and prolonged mission failure.  A sole source purchase is recommended in order to fulfill this mission requirement. This action will not be open for competition as Unidata is a proprietary product of IBM Corporation.  FOB Point shall be Destination, Scott AFB IL.  Delivery location is HQ SDDC, 709 Ward Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225.  

The following FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.204-7(b)(1)By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchase agreement resulting from this solicitation; FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items; DFARS 252-204-7004 Alternate A Central Contractor Registration; 252-212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes of Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions or Commercial Items (DEVIATION).

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR DIGITALCCD  CAMERA.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This noticeserves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will notbe issued.The purpose of this amendment is to answer a question from a vendor.  Question:  The specification calls for a total noise less than 30 electrons. Ourunderstanding of TSP and PSP imaging applications is that the noise requirements are muchlower. Can the technical POC confirm this value?  Answer:   The 30 electrons noise cited in the specifications is the total noise,including system electronics noise, dark pattern noise, and dark current shot noise atthe maximum read rate.	As for PSP and TSP requirements, many groups are moving away fromtypical slow-scan back-illuminated scientific grade cameras (which indeed have a muchlower noise floor) and using newer interline transfer and other front-illuminatedarchitecture cameras with success.  The total noise of these types of systems approachthis level.  It is expected that with the increased throughput that can be acquired usingthese types of cameras, image averaging and other means to decrease the noise (includingusing slower read rates if applicable) can be used as needed.  The TSP and PSPapplications envisioned for these cameras are such that the intensity changes to bemeasured should generally be well above this noise floor (30 electrons) and the possibleincreased throughput is more desirable (for possible higher frame rates).The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide theinformation stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service(NAIS) on April 30, 2008. Documents related to this procurement are available over theInternet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessedusing a WWW browser application.

The requirement is to demonstrate a prototype of the online 24/7 3D virtual learning environment described in the Draft MyBase (Prototype) SOW attached to this RFI.  The MyBase (Prototype) requirement supports efforts by AETC to establish and resource the MyBaseVirtual Air Force Base (vAFB) recommended in the white paper entitled On Learning:  The Future of Air Force Education and Training, reference Attachment 3.  The demonstration will be a proof-of-concept study that includes the delivery of two existing AETC courses converted into the MyBase (Prototype) environment.  Learners, instructors and visitors will participate in the MyBase (Prototype) environment either as an avatar in their likeness or via a live real-time audio/video event. 

SMALL BUSINESS (SB) SET-ASIDE DETERMINATION:

The Government reserves the right to decide whether or not a SB set-aside is appropriate for this acquisition based on responses to this notice.  In order for the Government to make a SB set-aside determination, it is emphasized that SB concerns provide sufficient written information to indicate their capability to successfully perform and manage all the requirements of this magnitude.  In the solicitation, the extent to which prime contractors provide for the significant use of small and small disadvantaged business subcontractors will be a consideration in the evaluation of proposals.

1. Do you follow a software development life cycle? Answer: No
 
2. What technologies are currently used for the web surveys? Answer: NIST MEP is unsurethe vendor decides upon and is responsible for the web survey technology
 
3. Is the Web survey database integrated with the CATI database? Answer: Yes
 
4. Are there citizenship limitations on resources? Answer: No
 
5. IT environment available for development and deployment? Answer: We expect the contractor to host and deploy the survey using their IT resources
 
6. Will there be a transition time for CATI software? Answer: We expect the contractor to have the CATI and web-based surveys tested and ready for deployment shortly after the contract is awarded
 
7. In terms of page limitation, the solicitation says that graphs and tables are excluded  does that mean that if we have tables in the Technical Approach, then  a page is excluded  (or what ever size the table is)? Also, are graphs specifically referring to bar graphs or pie charts, etc. and NOT a graphic/exhibit that would be in the text? Answer: For question 7, see solicitation 52.212-1 addendum Proposal Instructions paragraph (a)(ii).  States Courier 10 pitch or equivalent and must be double-spaced. 

 8. Can we use Times New Roman 11 point font, and space and a half instead of double-spaced?  See answer to question 7.
 
 9. Due to the short turn around, would the Government be amenable to extending the proposal due date? Answer:  Yes, due date revised to April 25, 2008.
 
10.  The above referenced RFP did not include a Section B with labor categoriesDo you have a list of specific labor categories or should we propose our own labor categories? Answer: Offerors are to propose the types of labor categories to be utilized to perform the required services outlined in the statement of work.

11.   What is the contract amount for the most recent year this study was conducted?  We are interesting in the annual dollar amount, not the total multi-year amount of the contract awarded to Synovate. The yearly amount for FY2007  was approximately $432,876.00.
 
 12.  Please provide an estimate of the number of pre-survey letters mailed each week in the upcoming study. 
 Answer:  The number of pre-survey letters mailed each quarter is equal to the number of surveys attempted.  Please reference http://mep.nist.gov/documents/pdf/about-   mep/impacts/FY2006_MEP%20Delivering%20Measurable%20Results.pdf
 
13.   Please provide an estimate of the number of telephone surveys conducted each week in the upcoming study. 
 Answer: Please reference http://mep.nist.gov/documents/pdf/about-mep/impacts/FY2006_MEP%20Delivering%20Measurable%20Results.pdf  The number of telephone surveys completed each  quarter is provided here.  The scheduling is largely up to the vendor as long as the vendor assures that there is sufficient time for several telephone survey attempts.
 
14.   What is the governments estimate of the ratio of interviews completed by Internet vs. by telephone in the upcoming study?  For instance, 25% completed by phone and 75% by Internet? 
Answer: Please reference http://mep.nist.gov/documents/pdf/about-mep/impacts/FY2006_MEP%20Delivering%20Measurable%20Results.pdf for the answer.  NIST MEP desires to work towards an internet-only survey, with other modes of survey used only for back-up purposes.

<SUBJECT>Alternative Non-Intrusive Inspection Technologies for Enhanced Screening and Inspection
<SOLNBR>RFI-08-00003
<RESPDATE>051608
<CONTACT>Brenda D Brady, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-6771, Fax 202-254-5396, Email brenda.brady@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Borders and Maritime Security Division (BMD) of the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) issues this Request for Information (RFI) regarding alternative non-intrusive inspection (NII,) technologies for enhanced screening and inspection by the Customs and Border Protection Agency (CBP) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). 
Background:  Customs & Border Protections mission is to secure U.S. ports of entry from people and goods that are prohibited or which threaten U.S. citizens, infrastructure, resources and food supply, while efficiently facilitating legitimate trade and travel. TSAs mission is to protect the Nations transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement of people and commerce.  Both CBP and TSA have a need to improve technologies currently being deployed for incoming cargo conveyance inspection and air cargo shipment inspection. Current NII technologies employed by CBP and TSA primarily consist of X-Ray and Gamma-Ray systems whose mission is to detect traditional contraband (i.e. drugs, currency, illegal firearms and high explosives) that may be illicitly smuggled in cargo containers and air shipping containers. The ultimate goal of this effort is to provide CBP and TSA with technology with enhanced capabilities resulting in a greater confidence of detecting WMD, contraband, explosives, hidden compartments or stowaways during screening and examination of cargo.   
Objective:  For a research and development project that will be starting in FY 09, DHS S&T is seeking new and emergent technologies for a new type of NII system as well as emergent technologies that could augment existing NII systems. The purpose of this RFI is to investigate alternative approaches to non-intrusively inspect cargo and how this may be achieved through emerging technologies and/or current technologies, other than radiography, that can be applied in a different manner. This next generation system will significantly improve CBPs and TSAs capability to conduct non-intrusive screening and examination of ship, land and air cargo.

The key objective of this project is to advance research and development to:

	Explore alternative, higher risk, non-intrusive inspection (NII) technologies for scanning cargo for both high-density and low-density cargoes. These could include but are not limited to acoustic, infrared, ultra-wideband radar, millimeter wave, and other emergent or unknown or undiscovered technologies. Investigate non-traditional industries for scanning and imaging systems, such as the medical, space, undersea and industrial and manufacturing commercial markets.

	Improve the system users ability to more confidently identify contraband and threat materials in ship, land and air cargo containers, by non-intrusively scanning both high-density and low-density cargo. 

	Improve operational and maintenance costs, improve container throughput, reduction in weight of mobile NII systems, reductions in operator manpower due to automation, and increased sustainability of scanning equipment in extreme weather conditions and all-port environments.   

	Minimize health and safety concerns of users and respective trucking and labor unions

Operational Concepts:  Ultimately, this project is intended to address the following CBP and TSA key security capability gaps:

	Enhanced screening and examination of cargo by NII methods for WMD, contraband, hidden compartments or stowaway with improved resolution and throughput advanced non-intrusive inspection methods. 

	Enhanced screening and examination of air cargo by advanced non-intrusive methods which will perform neutral to commodity type; to address inspection of air cargo container Unit Load Devices (ULD), bulk, and break bulk configurations.

	Enhanced flexibility for NII systems to include fixed, mobile, and pallet screening devices

Notional Technical Objectives for an Alternative Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) System for Enhanced Screening and Inspection

Traditionally, the technical objectives for radiographic (x-ray and Gamma) NII systems have focused on the systems capability in areas of penetration, resolution, contrast sensitivity, throughput and reliability. Alternative approaches that may improve screening and examination will be considered. 

Describe your technology improvements in the following areas based on the following technical objectives to scan high-density and low-density cargo:

	Improvements in Penetration 

	Improvements in Resolution

	Improvements in Contrast Sensitivity

Or, describe the capability improvements your approach will offer to enable the system user to more confidently identify contraband and threat materials in ship, land and air cargo containers. Describe the technical objectives that will be achieved.

And, describe the technologys capability to provide: 

	Improvements in Throughput

	Improvements in Reliability

	Improvements in Image Quality

	Reduction in the Total Number of Users Required to Operate the System

	Improvements in Mobile System Weight

	Improvements in Sustainability

	Improvements in Health and Safety

<DESC>The primary objectives of the Hyperadsorptive Atmospheric Sampling Technology (HAST) program are to develop a system that permits exhaustive, accurate, and economical collection of atmospheric trace constituents to support chemical mapping of urban and military environments.  The system, which integrates three technical components, will demonstrate materials, packaging, and extraction technologies that sample atmospheric impurities whose concentration ranges from 10 parts per trillion to 100 parts per million by volume from 100 liter-atmospheres of gas in less than five minutes.  In the second phase, a complete system that weighs less than one kilogram including power, indexing for one hundred samples, and GPS geolocation will be demonstrated.
