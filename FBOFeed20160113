<DESC>This synopsis is for a Multiple Year, Indefinite Delivery Requirements Contract (IDRC) for the procurement of sole source, part-numbered items manufactured by GE CAGEs 99207 and 77482.  This acquisition supports the tenets of streamlining by employing a Joint Opportunity whereby DLA consumables as well as Depot Level Reparables (DLRs) are combined in a single acquisition strategy using long term contracting procedures.  A single award is anticipated.  The key component of this Strategic Supplier Alliance (SSA) will be the ability to effectively provide management visibility into efficiency and productivity of the contract. 

DSCR currently does not have a competitive data package for any of the 7,364 DLA consumable NSNs or 393 DLRs included in this solicitation. The initial phase will consist of approximately 699 NSNs (both DLA consumables and DLRs) which are anticipated to be awarded at time of basic contract award.  The NSNs, part numbers, and annual estimated quantities are available upon request and will also be posted at the Strategic Acquisition Directorate website.  Alternate offers must submit a complete technical data package for each NSN for approval in order to be considered for award. Terms are FOB Origin, inspection/acceptance at origin, DLA Direct shipments only.  Foreign Military Sales (FMS) applicable to DLRs only.  Other than Full and Open Competition- 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1).  Sole Source Reference FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).

Solicitation is expected to result in an IDRC that is firm, fixed pricing with incentives.  The Statement of Work (SOW) outlines the governments requirements and includes metrics to monitor contractor performance.  DLA Surge & Sustainment requirements apply to the DLA consumable items.  Pricing will be based on the Estimated Annual Demand (EAD) quantity.  Required items are commercial and military unique. Required delivery is to be negotiated for each item.  

The solicitation is expected to be issued on March 30, 2010 with a closing date of April 30, 2010.  A copy of the solicitation is available via the DLA-BSM Internet Bid Board System (DIBBS) at: https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil on the issue date cited in the RFP.  From the DIBBS homepage, select RFP/IFBs from the top of the page.  Then choose the appropriate Search Category & Search Value, then click Submit in order to view the RFP.  RFPs are in portable document format (PDF).  To download and view this document you will need the latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader.  This software is available free at: http://www.adobe.com.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center intends to enter into negotiations on a single source basis with Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL to support Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) Category III Aircraft Precision Approach Navigation Integrity and Continuity. Through a previous aviation research grant with the FAA, the Illinois Institute of Technology has performed research which has allowed the FAA to reach the current state of Category I GBAS integrity and continuity. The FAA has a requirement to extend the GBAS integrity and continuity to assure the integrity of Category III operations in the National Airspace System (NAS). The requirement also includes the evaluation and mitigation of Category III integrity and continuity for the GBAS Reference Receiver Broadband. In order to meet the requirements of this effort in a timely matter, and to eliminate the need to duplicate work already conducted by Illinois Institute of Technology, a single source contract is in the best interest of the FAA.

The FAA intends to procure the above in accordance with Acquisition Management System (AMS) paragraph 3.2.2.4.  A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA is not liable for any costs associated with the preparing of a response to this announcement. For information concerning this announcement, contact the Contract Specialist, Veronica Anderson at veronica.anderson@faa.gov, no later than 4 p.m. (local time) on January 22, 2016.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A SOLICITATION FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Institutes of Health intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Wiley, 111 River Street, Hoboken, NJ 07030-5774 for online access to the Wiley Journal Database. This service will provide expanded access to Wiley electronic scientific and technical journals and continued access to the Cochrane Collection and Current Protocols. This access will be made available to NIH community as well as HHS staff. This is a critical information source for the researchers, clinicians and administrative staff of NIH, and other HHS agencies.</p>
<p>No solicitation exists for this requirement. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. The product is a commercial item as defined in FAR Part 2.101. The period of performance shall be for one eleven (11) months base period, with options to renew for four (4) successive twelve month periods. It is believed that Wiley is the sole source for this requirement under the authority of U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements" because of the following: Wiley is the only known source that owns the exclusive rights to sell , distribute or provide online access to the Wiley Journal Database being acquired under this requirement.</p>
<p><br />Below is the Draft Statement of Work. This is NOT A SOLICITATION FOR COMPETIVE PROPOSALS.

Capability Statements and related materials must be received by the Contract Specialist, no later than January 27, 2016 at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time. Written responses received after this date and time will not be accepted. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on the responses received is solely within the discretion of the government. The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Address responses via email only to the attention of: O. Joy Ajao, The National Institutes of Health, OLAO, Office of Acquisitions, email address: ajaooj@mail.nih.gov</p>
<p>DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>PROJECT TITLE: Access to Wiley's Online Resources</p>
<p>I. Statement of Work</p>
<p>A. Background Information<br />John Wiley &amp; Sons provides access to online resources for NIH staff and HHS agency staff served by the NIH Library (DLS), including over 1500 journals in a wide range of scientific, technical and medical subjects; the Cochrane Library; Current Protocols; and select online reference works. Links from PubMed, Web of Science&reg;, and the NIH Library website allow NIH staff to connect directly to the articles on the Wiley website following a search of the various sites. Wiley online resources allow DLS to provide enhanced and timely access to information NIH staff need to perform their work whether they are intramural researchers or extramural program administrators. Feedback from NIH and HHS researchers, clinicians and administrators indicates that the easy accessibility of needed information made possible by providing electronic access to Wiley resources has increased their productive work time, because of the time saved identifying and retrieving relevant articles.</p>
<p>B. Objectives</p>
<p>The specific objective of this requirement requires the contractor to provide the NIH and the HHS agency staff served by the NIH Library (DLS) access to the electronic version of all Wiley journals, the Cochrane Library, Current Protocols, and select online reference works through its web interface. Access will be cumulative for articles published in the journals since 1997 or the first year a journal was offered on the Wiley platform. The contractor is also required to provide access to other databases and journals as outlined under the "specific requirements" section of this SOW.</p>
<p><br />II. Services to be performed</p>
<p>A. General Requirements</p>
<p>1. Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment and facilities needed to perform the Statement of Work below.</p>
<p>2. All work under this contract shall be monitored by the Project Officer.</p>
<p><br />B. Specific Requirements</p>
<p>Specifically, the contractor shall:</p>
<p>1. Provide the NIH and the HHS agency staff served by the NIH Library (DLS) access to the electronic version of all Wiley journals, the Cochrane Library, Current Protocols, and select online reference works through its web interface. Access will be cumulative for articles published in the journals since 1997 or the first year a journal was offered on the Wiley platform, based upon previous investments.</p>
<p>2. The contractor also shall provide options for acquiring eBooks, online reference works, and backfiles of selected journals. Options should factor in all previous investments in print and digital subscriptions, as well as previous archive backfile purchases.</p>
<p>3. The contractor may also provide options to include all Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agencies with access to the same resources as identified in this contract.</p>
<p>4. In the event of a major natural disaster (local, regional, national, or international), then in addition to the other rights granted under this Agreement, Wiley will allow DLS to provide access to the Licensed Electronic Products for a maximum of 180 days upon approval which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed after which time an extension may be granted to any otherwise unaffiliated health professional, ("Emergency Workers") and ("Displaced Users") from other institutions that are not included as one of DLS' Institutions but which have been affected by such a disaster ("Emergency Institutions") so long as the DLS has established temporary affiliation with such an Emergency Institution in order to meet the demands of the population affected by the disaster and any healthcare needs resulting from the disaster. For purposes of this Agreement, such Displaced Users, Emergency Institutions and Emergency Workers will be considered Authorized Users of the respective Institution that requests Wiley to provide the access to the Licensed Electronic Products under this clause. Under this clause, Wiley will allow previously unidentified IP addresses that are provided by DLS access to the Licensed Electronic Products.</p>
<p>5. DLS may fulfill interlibrary loan requests in accord with Section 108 of the United States Copyright Law (17 USC Sec. 108, "Limitations on exclusive rights: Reproduction by libraries and archives") and clause 3 of the Guidelines for the Proviso of Subsection 108(g)(2) prepared by the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works.</p>
<p>6. DLS shall retain perpetual access to all subscribed years of resources.</p>
<p><br />C. Government Responsibilities</p>
<p>1. The Government will be responsible for providing an interface via web links for the NIH community to access the Wiley website.<br />2. NIH will be responsible for creating a system to validate security for entrance into the website.<br />3.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  North Cascades National Park Service Complex (NOCA) will hire one or two contractors to conduct archeological studies at three pre-contact-age archeological sites in the drawdown of Ross Lake (reservoir).  This work is authorized by the 1991 settlement agreements entered into by the City of Seattle (City) and the National Park Service (NPS) to meet licensing requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and NPS cultural resources management policies as these relate to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and its amendments.

1B.  National Register evaluation of 45WH441 South East Landing #2 
2.  Archeological Data Recovery Excavation at Site 45WH262, Devil's Junction Creek #2
Field season will be during the annual drawdown of the reservoir, approximately April through June, 2016, depending on reservoir depth.  The final report will be due in February, 2017. 
NPS reserves the right to make multiple awards and plans to award one or two firm-fixed-price contracts for the work.   If two contracts are awarded, the work will be divided as Items 1A and 1B in one contract and Item 2 in the second contract.  We prefer to award one contract if the contractor has sufficient capacity to perform all work at all sites within the 2016 anticipated annual drawdown period.
PROJECT LOCATION:  The three sites are located in Ross Lake National Recreation Area, eastern Whatcom County, Washington, on lands managed by NPS.  There is no direct car access to any of the sites and access logistics are challenging.  The sites are on the unvegetated reservoir bottom (drawdown zone) where reservoir sediments and eroded soils are exposed to air during annual lowering of the reservoir level.  Full pool elevation of the reservoir is 1602.5 feet above sea level (ft asl) and the site elevations are approximately 1540, 1550, and 1570 ft asl.  Maps and information about the park are at www.nps.gov/NOCA and www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/boating-on-ross-lake.htm.       
DETAILS:  This is a best value procurement set-aside for small business concerns in accordance with FAR Part 19.5. The NAICS code for this project is 541720, Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities and the small business size standard is $20.5 million, average annual gross receipts for the past three years.  The solicitation and award processes will use FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and reference the Service Contract Act.
All eligible responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the National Park Service; however quoters who have not established and/or maintained an active registration and completed the online representations and certifications at www.SAM.gov prior to the response due date and time will be considered either ineligible or non-responsive and will not be considered for award. 
Prospective quoters will be required to visit www.FBO.gov periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the solicitation documents; no notifications will be sent nor will hard copies of the solicitation be mailed or issued.   Vendors can search for opportunities and award history on www.FBO.gov without registering, however, registered vendors may use FBOs Interested Vendors List and Watchlist.  Registering also provides opportunity to receive notifications, which is a tool of convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.  
It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division intends to issue a Job Order (JO) under a sole source Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00164-12-G-JQ66. The BOA was issued to Raytheon Company, McKinney, TX. Acquisitions under the BOA have been and will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition was the lack of sufficient technical data, restricted software rights, duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source. As a result of this JO the overall contract ceiling for BOA N00164-12-G-JQ66 will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>This JO is anticipated to procure 13 Turret Units and 9 Electronic Units for the MTS systems and associated support such as: Engineering Services and data. The Engineering Services may include reach back, maintenance/repair, engineering/logistics analyses, reliability efforts, maintainability efforts, sparing/provisioning support, configuration management, technical support, field support and test equipment support (hardware and software), and related support for MTS in support of the US Navy Triton program. The services are for a 15 month period of performance.</p>
<p>Request for proposal will not be made available through http://www.fbo.gov. The request for proposal will be provided to Raytheon Company through electronic mail. The proposed noncompetitive contract action is anticipated to be awarded under FAR part 15, contracting by negotiations. The anticipated contract action award date is 15 JUN 2016. Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Raytheon Company, 2501 West University Drive, McKinney, TX 75071-2813 directly. <br />The point of contact at NSWC Crane is Ms. Vonda Pollock, Code CXPL at telephone 812-854-6866, Fax 812-854-5066 or e-mail: vonda.pollock@navy.mil.

The Debt Collection Management Staff manages the program with legal oversight by the United States Attorney's Offices at the district level. The program is currently running in 19 districts nationwide, with further expansion planned. This procurement is strictly limited to attorneys who are licensed to practice law in the Eastern District of Michigan. Contractors will be required to pursue debt collection activities which parallel existing industry procedures that have proven to be effective and efficient; to interact with government representatives at defined stages of the collection process (i.e., settlement, compromise, etc.); and to input relevant case data in a computer database maintained by the Government. Contract payments will be based primarily on contingency fee payments for unsecured debt collection. The anticipated period of performance for each contract will be a base year with up to four option years. The solicitation will be available only on the Federal Business Opportunities website, www.fbo.gov, and is anticipated to be released on or about February 1, 2016.

<RESPDATE>012216
<CONTACT>Patricia White, Contract Specialist, Phone (228) 688-3607, Email Patricia.White-1@nasa.gov
<DESC>The NASA/SSC Office of Procurement intends to issue a sole source, firm-fixed price contract to D2K Technologies for Integrated System Health Management (ISHM) and Autonomous Operation (AO) capabilities which are being implemented using the NASA toolkit developed with the G2 Bundle programming environment (G2/Symcure/NeurOnLine). The core implementation is based on creating the ISHM Domain Model (ISHM-DM) and the Autonomy Domain Model (A-DM) of the system. The ISHM-DM incorporates data, information, and knowledge (DIaK) needed to achieve ISHM capability; within an architecture that enables integrated use of DIaK by a system defined in terms of intelligent sensors and components. The A-DM incorporates the ISHM-DM and includes Autonomy domain knowledge needed for autonomous operation. Efforts for the first delivery will concentrate on updating/modifying the NASA Toolkit modularization and documentation to make it suitable for certification, and implementing concept-based physics models for use in ISHM and autonomous control. Capabilities to provide the required services include expert level programming in G2/Symcure/NeurOnLine, solid credentials in the ISHM and autonomy fields encompassing experience and evidence of expertise, working knowledge and experience in implementation of G2-Based solutions for NASA cryogenic management systems or similar, and working knowledge of the NASA ISHM-AO Toolkit.<br /><br />
<p>The estimated period of performance is two (2) years from contract award. D2K Technologies has been providing a service through the previous procurement that corresponds to an area of technology and expertise that is not yet at a mature state throughout the industry. There will be only one award made for this requirement. This is a sole source commercial acquisition under the authority of FAR Part 12 and FAR Subpart 13.5. The Government believes only one responsible source can provide the services that will satisfy the Agency's requirements. This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) for competition. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort, in writing, to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00 p.m. (local time) on January 22, 2016. Statement of capabilities must contain sufficient details to review vendor's capabilities. Submissions will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. This acquisition will be a small business set-aside. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541511 and $25M respectively. FOB is destination. It is anticipated that a solicitation will be issued to D2K Technologies on or about January 27, 2016 with their response due NLT 4:00 p.m. February 5, 2016. An ombudsman has been appointed.

<ARCHDATE>02032016
<CONTACT>Downey, Donald
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The Department of the Interior (DOI), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 334513,  with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees for an upcoming requirement for the USGS National Water Quality Laboratory, Denver Federal Center, Lakewood, CO 80225 to provide PALL WATER FILTERS; Brand Name or Equal to Brand Name Salient Characteristics.  


Non-Manufacturer Rule (NMR). The NMR allows a small business to offer a product that it did not manufacturer under a small business set-aside if Small Business Administration (SBA) has offered a waiver.  SBA does not offer a waiver for these supplies.  On a supply contract, a firm must perform at least 50% of the cost of manufacturing the supplies (not including the cost of materials). The NMR is an exception to the performance requirements, and provides that a firm that is not a manufacturer may qualify as a small business on a supply contract set aside for small business if, among other things, it supplies the product of a small business made in the United States.  The Brand Name supplies are not made by a small business in the United States.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION AS REQUESTED BY THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR. Submission is voluntary.

This requirement is for water filters which are equal to the attached Brand Name Salient Characteristics.

The Government is not required to issue a solicitation.

Responses to this announcement are requested from Small Businesses. 

In response to this announcement, please indicate your firm's socioeconomic status (e.g. small business, service-disabled veteran-owned, women owned, HUBZone, etc.)  This information will assist the Government in determining how small businesses can fit into the acquisition strategy.

A firm is considered small under NAICS code 334513 if their AVERAGE annual number of employees for the preceding three (3) years were less than or equal to 500 employees.

All Contractor work in Sterile Processing Suite and Surgical Suite shall primarily be performed after normal working hours.  Work in mechanical rooms and areas outside of the suites may typically be performed during normal working hours subject to coordination with VA.

All Surgical Suite work shall be phased over weekends with all infection control barriers removed when complete.

All new finish floor work indicated for the Sterile Processing Suite shall be coordinated to occur over weekends that occur commensurate with a federal holiday - providing a 3-day weekend for uninterrupted finish flooring work activities. (Refer to Deduct Alternate No. 1.)

Coordinate with VA to allow time for terminal cleaning by VA prior to completion of each phase.    

A general narrative of work to be performed by each discipline follows.  Refer to Project plans and specifications for complete details of work to be performed. 

ARCHITECTURAL / STRUCTURAL / INTERIORS

DEMOLITION:

Demolition work is limited to immediate areas of new work indicated.

Sterile Processing Services (1st Floor):
The portion of quarry tile flooring located under the new Cart Washer is to be removed. Structural plans define the limited removal of a concrete slab (on grade) and a topping slab over the existing tunnel below to accommodate the new Cart Washer. The slab removal permits the Cart Washer to be installed without a ramp - which is required to provide access from the department.

CMU partition removal is limited to areas where required to facilitate installation of new SPS equipment. New plumbing drains require limited disturbance of existing floor slabs within SPS. Cutting and patching of the roof over the SPS department is required for relocation of HVAC supply ductwork. Cutting and patching the existing mechanical room exterior wall is required for the relocation of an exhaust duct serving the new Cart Washer below and installation of a new exterior louver.

Each area of existing SPS disturbance is enclosed by dust control partitions. Dust partitions shall be pre-engineered manufactured demountable (hard) partitions that limit interference and dust disturbance within and adjacent to the SPS department.

Existing ceilings systems are to be removed within the cart wash room and the adjacent storage room where construction of a new CMU wall is indicated at the new Cart Wash location.

The project is sequentially phased for both demolition and construction work to occur.  Work on subsequent phases shall not begin without concurrence by VA.  Dust partitions shall remain in place for each phase until the phase is completed, including equipment installation by the equipment vendor.  

Infection control plans and Division 010000 specifications allow for the contractor's provision of flexible ductwork running from the existing (abandoned) EtO exhaust system located above SPS to provide negative pressure at each of the dust partition enclosures. HEPA filtered negative air machines may also be required. Each phase shall include continuous pressure monitoring with 24/7 digital read out and data logging.

Contract work shall be primarily performed after normal working hours as indicated by contract documents.  
Surgery (3rd Floor):

Partition and partial ceiling removal is required to facilitate the relocation of an existing automatic door pair. Existing automatic door is removed and salvaged for reuse within the scope of work. Modification of 2 existing offices is included in the renovation.

Each phase of the Surgery Department renovation is enclosed by dust control partitions. Dust partitions shall be pre-engineered manufactured demountable (hard) partitions that limit interference and dust disturbance within the department.

HEPA filtered negative air machines shall be required for work in Surgical Suite. 

Existing finish flooring within the Surgery department is not to be removed.  Flooring shall be patched as required to match existing flooring as required by modifications.

Existing ceilings are removed as required to accommodate the automatic door pair relocation.

NEW WORK:

New partition work is limited to that required to facilitate installation of new equipment in SPS and automatic door relocation at Surgery entry area.

At the 1st floor level, new CMU partitions shall be constructed adjacent to the new Cart Washer and in the area of the new instrument Washer/Disinfector. New custom stainless steel access closets shall be constructed adjacent to the new Instrument Washer/Disinfector. The detergent dispenser will be installed within these access closets. The access closets also allow for the routine maintenance of the new Washer Disinfector.

Plans also define new surgical processing equipment for the SPS department. Equipment includes 3 adjustable height 2-bowl processing sinks, 1 Cart Washer and 1 Washer/Disinfector. The Washer/Disinfector and Cart Washer are to be furnished by VAMC and the basis for design on the equipment is Steris models. Contractor will be furnished cut sheets on new equipment furnished by VAMC at the Pre-Bid walk through.

Three new height adjustable decontamination (processing) sinks are Contractor Furnished, Contractor Installed. (Refer to Specification Section 117101 - Medical Washing and Sterilizing Equipment.)

Structural details show both the new roof penetration (required by mechanical design) and the infill of an existing (abandoned) mechanical room floor penetration.

Deduct Alternate No. 2:
Two existing door pairs shall receive new automatic openers. One is motion controlled, the other is key pad controlled. Both automatic operators and all associated systems are defined within the documents as Deduct Alternate No. 2.

INTERIOR FINISHES:

Interior finishes for the SPS department are designed to raise the level of finishes to meet the minimum standards of the VA design guidelines. Scope involves patch and painting of the ceiling surfaces and installation of new finish flooring. New SPS finish flooring is defined as Deduct Alternate No. 1.

New wall finishes are minimal but include painted CMU and Stainless Steel lamination over CMU and water resistant gypsum board in the SPS. Surgery walls are finished with gypsum board and painted. Where partitions have been removed, walls are patched and finished to match adjacent surfaces.

The ceiling in both the 'Clean' and 'Dirty' sides of SPS are to be patched, repaired and painted.

Deduct Alternate No. 1: SPS Finish Floor Installation:
The new finish flooring specified is a urethane based Resinous floor installed over a 5/16" resinous mortar applied directly over the existing Quarry Tile flooring. This system is compliant with the VA TIL standards and master specification for 'RES-4'.
 
Installation of the RES-4 flooring requires the preparation of existing quarry tile by removal of any loose tiles - and grinding of the existing surface to properly prepare it for adherence of the new mortar bed. The urethane finish is then applied with a top coat of sealer.

Flooring work is indicated with corresponding temporary dust control partitions.

An existing layer of quarry tile flooring shall be removed from a small area adjacent to the existing SPS pass-through where it is laminated onto an underlying layer of quarry tile flooring - which is to remain. This work is to occur within the scope of Deduct Alternate No. 1 only.

All new finish flooring within the SPS is defined within the documents as Deduct Alternate #1. This alternate is indicated on the plans and specified within Section 010000, General Requirements.  Deduct Alternate #1 shall include contractor assistance (with VA supervision) in the temporary relocation of all carts and portable equipment as shown on Drawing AE301. This equipment will be temporarily located in the adjacent sterile storage Room 1E06-1. Following the finish floor installation, the equipment will be moved back to the Sterile Processing department by the contractor and terminal cleaning will be performed by the VAMC.  All moving, flooring installation, and cleaning shall be performed over a 3 day weekend or as otherwise coordinated with VA.

Refer to Construction Documents for the complete scope of Architectural, Structural and Interiors work involved with the project.

The Per-Procedure rates for the base year and any option years, should they be renewed, will correspond to the most current and active published Medicare rates at the time the medical services are rendered under the this contract.  Corresponding Per-Procedure rate adjustments could result in either a decrease or increase in payment to the Contractor depending on the rates published by Medicare for any given time period.  
The burden of notifying the VA Contracting Officer and/or Contracting Officer Representative of any changes in Medicare rates lies with the Contractor.  The Contractor's notification to the VA Contracting Offices should include a list detailing the new Medicare rates and published documentation that substantiates that these rates are currently effective or will be effective at a future date. Within seven (7) calendar days of being properly notified of the change(s) in Medicare rates by the Contractor, the VA Contracting Officer will attempt to verify the change(s) with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

If the change(s) can be verified, the VA Contracting Officer will implement the corresponding adjustments within fourteen (14) calendar days of verification unless the effective date has not yet arrived.  In the latter case, the VA Contracting Officer will implement the change(s) on the effective date unless the effective date falls within the fourteen (14) calendar days; therefore the VA Contracting Officer is afforded to implement the change(s) after verification.  The VA Contracting Officer reserves the right to retain any of the remaining fourteen (14) calendar days between verification and implementation regardless of the effective date of the change(s). 
 The Contractor is not entitled to retroactive payment rate adjustments prior to implementation of the change(s) in Medicare rates by the VA Contracting Officer.  "Piecemeal" changes to Medicare rates, such as only seeking per-procedure rate adjustments for select codes or a select group of codes, will not be permitted under any circumstance.  The Contractor shall accept all Medicare rate changes for the period in which they are effective. 
VA reserves the right to adjust the Per-Procedure rates under this contract at any time should Medicare rates change regardless of whether the Contractor notified the VA Contracting Officer of the change(s).  The Contractor will be given a notice of such actions at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the effective date of the change(s).  Should there be any disagreement with the VA Contracting Officer's proposed change, the Contractor must submit a response outlining those areas in which the Contractor disagrees.  This response must be provided to the Contracting Officer within seven (7) calendar days of notification of the anticipated change.  The VA Contracting Officer reserves the right to make the final determination with regard to any change.  Should the VA Contracting Officer implement any change(s) in Medicare rates under this contract, the Contractor shall accept all corresponding adjustments for the time period in which they are effective.
18.    INDEMNIFICATION AND MEDICAL LIABILITY INSURANCE:

The Department of Veterans Affairs has need for a general construction contractor to provide all labor, materials and equipment as necessary to construct a post-tensioned cast-in-place, concrete expansion of an existing open parking structure on the North West section of the George E. Wahlen VA Medical Center campus located in Salt Lake City, UT.  NCO 19 is conducting market research to determine if sufficient competition exists in the Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) socio-economic programs. The SDVOSB and VOSB firms must have the capability and capacity to perform work with a construction magnitude between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. 
The NAICS code for this procurement will be 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. The parking expansion includes a new one-story vertical expansion over the existing parking garage.  The garage will expand horizontally to include a ground floor plus 2 elevated floors. A portion of the existing on-grade parking will be replaced by the horizontal garage expansion. The total of additional parking structure is 106,000 square feet.  A roof will be constructed to cover the entirety of the open parking garage.  The structure will accommodate approximately 346 new parking spaces. Work shall include, but may not be limited to, all general construction, alterations, roads, curb, gutters, walks, grading, drainage, landscaping, mechanical, fire protection and sprinkler system, technology and electrical work, extensions and alterations to utility systems, elevators, stairwells, rooftop equipment and, any and all necessary removal, modifications, demolition, alterations of existing structures and construction and certain other items to construct the complete project. The current small business size standard for 236220 is $36.5 million.
The POC for this project will be Josiah Benton. He can be contacted at 303-372-7026 or email at josiah.benton@va.gov.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Acquisition Operations, Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), located at 23 Christopher Way, Eatontown, NJ 07724 intends to enter into a contract on the basis of other than full and open competition for the VA Financial Services Center (FSC) for TeamMate Software Licenses.  The TAC intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed-Priced (FFP) contract for a twelve (12) month Base Period and four (4) 12-month Option Periods to Wolters Kluwer Financial Services Inc., doing business as Wolters Kluwer, 100 South 5th Street, Suite 700, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55402.

This proposed action includes the procurement of 15 TeamMate Audit Management (AM) licenses, 5 full/50 casual Controls Management (CM) licenses, TeamMate AM and CM Suite training, and software maintenance for FSC's existing TeamMate AM and CM licenses within the base year period of performance.  Additionally, the procurement will include four, one-year option periods, which will provide for the procurement of additional licenses, continued software maintenance on existing and subsequently acquired licenses, and additional training offerings.  This software is needed to support FSC and its increased audit workload resulting from the Veteran Access to Care Act of 2014.  The additional licenses must operate within the existing FSC hardware and software infrastructure previously established upon existing TeamMate licenses.  Only TeamMate software provides for full interoperability with the existing hardware infrastructure, database technologies, and integration with current management software.  Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc. is the developer and sole provider of the TeamMate brand of auditing software, and there are no authorized resellers.  Additionally, Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc. owns the proprietary software code, and has no plans to sell it or to allow any other contractor to access it as a reseller to provide maintenance support. Therefore, no other source possesses the proprietary data or source code necessary to provide maintenance of the TeamMate licenses.
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.3304(a)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) for this effort is 511210. The estimated date of award for this action is January 29, 2016.
This serves as a notice of intent, not a request for quotes.  Solicitation VA118-16-Q-0853, is hereby attached for informational purpose, only.  Questions/responses shall be submitted via e-mail to Contract Specialist, Timothy Pearson, e-mail:  timothy.pearson@va.gov, with the subject line as: VA118-16-Q-0853.  The Points of Contact (POCs) for this action are Timothy Pearson, Contract Specialist, 732-795-1106 or Robert Kirzow, Contracting Officer, 732-795-1017.

<DESC>AN/ARS-6 (v14) Lightweight Airborne Recovery System (LARS) - Personnel Recovery (PR)
<p>Background: The Government is conducting market research to identify possible sources that may possess the expertise and capabilities to provide/acquire and install LARS System with Combat Survivor/Evader Locator (CSEL) radio capability. LARS is a Search and Rescue (SAR) and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) System that provides secure, encrypted, classified communications between rescue forces and isolated personnel during civil and combat rescue missions. LARS direction finding capabilities are to be compatible with all military survival radios currently or soon to be in use, namely the PRC-112 Hook radio and the AN/PRQ-7 CSEL radio. Additionally the LARS or equivalent system must be capable of transmitting in the worldwide approved 406MHz frequency in both classified and unclassified modes.</p>
<p>Any LARS system must meet the requirements specified in the Technical Drawing Package (TDP) for v14 LARS Program currently installed on several HC-130J aircraft. Sample drawings from the TDP are available to interested sources responding to this RFI. The drawings/technical data can only be disseminated pursuant to DoD Directive 5230.25. The TDP provides representative illustrations and definition of the types of operations needed. The Contracting Officer may only provide this information to qualified U.S. Contractors.

<p><br />Offeror Name:<br />Address:<br />Cage Code:<br />Joint Certification Office (JCO) Certification Number*:<br />Certification Expiration Date:<br />Phone:<br />Name of Offeror Representative:<br />Date of Request:</p>
<p>*A potential Offeror without a valid JCO Certification Number must acquire a valid JCO Certification Number before drawings/technical data can be disseminated. Instructions for obtaining this JCO Certification number are found at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/Default.aspx. OFFERORS WITHOUT A VALID JCO CERTIFICATION NUMBER MUST BEGIN THIS PROCESS IMMEDIATELY.</p>
<p>The complete TDP will be provided with the Request for Proposal (RFP) should an RFP be issued.</p>
<p>The total requirement may be for the purchase/installation of up to 26 LARS systems, spare parts, and support operational use for up to 2 years (quantity to be determined). Initial delivery of 10 systems and spares would be required no later than 12 months from the date of contract award. Options and/or new solicitations will be available through approximately 2026 to cover the full 37 aircraft in service and spares.</p>
<p>Your response must address your company's capability to meet the LARS technical requirements, manufacturing schedule, and production/support capabilities. If after reviewing this information you desire to participate by responding to this RFI, you should provide documentation that supports your company's ability to manufacture/procure/install LARS that meets these requirements. Failure to provide adequate documentation will inhibit the government's assessment of your capabilities. Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are permissible.</p>
<p>Please provide the following business information for your company, institution, or for any teaming or joint venture partners: Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; CAGE Code; Phone Number; E-mail Address; Web Page URL; and Size of business pursuant to (NAICS) Code.

The White Paper shall include the following details: (1) General statement of your company's capability and capacity to manufacture/procure/install the v14 LARS or equal system in the number requested; (2) Brief explanation of your experience in manufacturing of the LARS V14 or equal radio system or acquisition of like systems; (3) Estimated production cost for each v14 LARS install; (4) Approximate lead-time for acquiring your product. Response should be in an electronic format that is compatible with Microsoft Windows and Office 2010. The data can be submitted on CD-R/DVD-R along with a paper copy. The CD should be provided to Ms. Katherine Hamblin at the address below not later than 29 Jan 2016. Questions should be submitted to Ms. Katherine Hamblin at katherine.hamblin@us.af.mil and Capt Vanessa Pottinger at vanessa.pottinger@us.af.mil. The CD/DVD, cover label, and paper copy shall be marked "Proprietary/Competition Sensitive Information." Proprietary/competition sensitive information will be protected from disclosure. No classified information should be included in contractor submittals.</p>
<p>This is a request for information only and is not a solicitation for offers. This notice is issued for market research purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or commitment to issue an RFP; however, the Government reserves the right to issue a solicitation based upon its needs and the results obtained from this RFI.

<DESC>Description of Action:
This notice attempts to identify sources of expertise available for supporting the CHS Project Leader Office (PLO) and for procuring and integrating tactical hardware requirements.  This effort will include: continued procurement of hardware, engineering and integration, environmental ruggedization, repair of current fielded systems, Task Order (TO) services and maintenance of the total customer assets.   The current CHS-4 contract has a Period of Performance (PoP) to Aug 24, 2016. As a result, PdL CHS is preparing for a CHS-4 extension contract which will continue to provide support, to meet Unit Set Fielding (USF) and fielding schedules, to provide enhancements to Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) products, and maintenance of the tactical systems.  

Description of Support/Services for Tactical Requirements:
The CHS program improves interoperability and connectivity on the battlefield by providing state-of-the-art, fully qualified, interoperable, compatible, deployable and survivable equipment.  Additionally, the CHS-4 contract provides worldwide repair, maintenance, and logistics services through RSCs.  The CHS program is instrumental in equipping mission requirement on the battlefield.  The overall goal is to improve and provide the warfighter with new technology, interoperability and lower life cycle costs by standardizing battlefield command and control (C2) automation through the centralized acquisition of CHS contract through the use of common hardware platforms.  In addition, the CHS-4 contract provides commercial, ruggedized and near military specification versions of computers, peripherals, and networking devices while also providing industry-based services, products, and logistical support enhanced on COTS Information Technology (IT) that meets the unique requirements of Tactical Warfighter mission (and fielded units).  The CHS-4 equipment consists but is not limited to computers, handhelds, printers, Power Supplies, IP communication devices, and network equipment, to include routers, switches, media converters, and storage appliances.

Additionally, custom Operational Transit Cases (OTC), storage cases, custom mounts and Installation Kits (IKs) are required to meet stakeholder requirements.   Demands for equipment procured through the CHS-4 contract have continued to significantly increase each year, and greater volume is anticipated as a result of augmented Warfighter requirements associated with Program Manager (PM) operational tactical fielding schedules to maintain mission needs. Based on these demands, the CHS-4 extension will be required to meet these tactical requirements. The proposed CHS-4 extension and ordering period is needed to provide seamless support, sustainment and delivery of supply chain demands until award of the CHS-5 contract.

<DESC>The Defense Media Activity (DMA) is seeking authorized sources to provide Enterprise Application Security Testing (AST) Subscriptions, Associated Technical Service, and User Training to allow DMA to test new applications code, avert security breaches, and protect its systems/data (i.e., ability to support DMA with Static AST [SAST], Dynamic AST [DAST], Integrated AST [IAST], and mobile AST).
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS:</p>
<p>DMA Contracting Office - East<br />6700 Taylor Avenue<br />Fort Meade, MD 20755<br /><br />INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION to determine the availability and technical capability of large and small businesses (including the following subsets, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, HUBZone Firms; Certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses and Woman Owned Small Business) to provide the required products and/or services.</p>
<p>The Defense Media Activity is seeking interested vendors for the procurement of Training on all types of AST for five (5) people, one (1) Annual subscription with dynamic assessments for at least 40 customer Web and mobile applications during the subscription period plus the ability to allow at least 5 vendor-provided AST assessments with a minimum of 100,000 customer IP addresses processed within 2-5 days of processing time by vendor staff, three (3) Annual single user application service subscriptions for AST that allows unlimited DAST and SAST evaluations, and one (1) Annual technical services (at least during normal business hours during weekdays plus at least 10 hours of specific support for DAST, SAST, IAST, and mobile AST) to support setup and integration for AST software tools and provide technical guidance on all types of AST. The Government also desires the ability to support AST for common programming languages (at a minimum, Classic ASP, Java, JavaScript, C/C++, Objective C, .NET, HTML5, Visual Basic, and VBScript PHP, though additional languages would be desirable).</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: <br /><br />THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<p>CONTRACT/PROGRAM BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The DMA under the DoD Office of the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, operates the American Forces Network (AFN), a worldwide radio and television broadcast network serving over one million American service men and women, DoD civilians and their families that are stationed overseas in 175 countries, as well as U.S. Navy ships deployed at sea and overseas. American radio and television broadcasts are programmed and distributed to AFN worldwide locations via two independent satellite signals originating at the AFN-Broadcast Center (AFN-BC) in Riverside, California; one each to the Pacific and Atlantic regions.</p>
<p>Currently Defense Media Activity Headquarters has an existing AST subscription to support DAST and SAST. DMA requires DAST, SAST, IAST, and mobile AST. This requirement will provide DMA with enterprise AST subscriptions, associated technical Service, and user training and capability to identify and defend against the wide variety of cyber-threat applications that can steal critical Government information. Without it, the organization risks the theft of data and extended failure of service for its ~700 Department of Defense customers such as the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The subscriptions would allow the agency with access to the technical digital tools and code analysis services required to perform this task. The associated technical service is necessary to support the initial setup and integration of these things.</p>
<p>Contract Number: HQ516-15-P-0003<br />Contract Type: Firm Fixed-Price<br />Incumbent and their size: Alvarez &amp; Associates, Inc., Small Business<br />Method of previous acquisition: Open Market, SB Set-Aside<br /><br />Provide brief description of the current program/effort: Enterprise AST support for DMA and its customers</p>
<p>List Anticipated Time Frame: 12 Months from DOA, plus 4 Option Years</p>
<p>List Place of Performance: N/A</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES:</p>
<p>The Government requires the following capabilities (i.e., via subscriptions to AST services, technical support, and one-time training on AST to enable the items below):</p>
<p>- Ability to support SAST to test the application inside out while it is not running by assessing its code for vulnerabilities, Ability to support DAST to test the application outside in by assessing it in the midst of its operations (e.g., prodding at it in a multitude of ways);</p>
<p>- Ability to support IAST to integrate aspects of techniques used in SAST and DAST into one hybrid form (e.g., instrument an application to check the application while it is undergoing dynamic testing), Ability to support Mobile AST to test mobile applications (e.g., penetration testing to attempt hacking into these applications);</p>
<p>- Ability to support AST for common programming languages, since a vendor must be able to translate the programming code in order to do anything with it (at a minimum, Classic ASP, Java, JavaScript, C/C++, Objective C, .NET, HTML5, Visual Basic, and VBScript PHP, though additional languages would be desirable).</p>
<p>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS: N/A</p>
<p>SOURCES SOUGHT: <br />The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 511210.

<p><strong><br />C.</strong> This is a Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified business sources; and (2) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541711 for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method. All capability Statements sent in response to this Small Business Sources Sought notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Kyle Wisor, Contract Specialist, at kyle.wisor@nih.gov in either MS Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF), by January 27th, 2016 9:00 AM, EASTERN TIME under Solicitation Number: NHLBI-CSB-DE-2016-063-KEW. FAXES ARE NOT ACCEPTED</p>
<p><strong>D. Information:</strong></p>
<p>1. Background</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The mission of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) is to improve oral, dental and craniofacial health through research, research training, and the dissemination of health information.</p>
<p>The Melvin Laboratory, Secretory Mechanisms and Dysfunction Section (SMDS), NIDCR/NIH, and the Yates Laboratory at The Scripps Research Institute (SRI) have a long-standing scientific collaboration over the past decade. The physiology expertise of the Melvin Laboratory and the development of cutting-edge proteomic methods by the Yates Laboratory have been combined to characterize novel aspects of salivary gland function. This collaboration has resulted in nine joint publications to date. It is estimated that one out of every four or five persons will suffer from xerostomia (dry mouth) during their lifetime. The clinical costs of dry mouth include mucosal infections and ulcers, altered taste, dysphagia and pain. To develop specific and effective interventions to treat dry mouth it is necessary to understand the molecular nature of the fluid secretion process. Acinar cell fluid secretion is driven by transcellular Cl movement. The Melvin Laboratory has recently shown that activation of an apical Ca2+-dependent Cl channel encoded by the Tmem16A gene (Catal&aacute;n et al., 2015) is the obligatory, rate-limiting step in fluid production. Although it is clear that Ca2+ directly activates Tmem16A, it is unknown how sustained activity of the Tmem16A channel is maintained/regulated.</p>
<p>2. Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The SMDS, in collaboration with the contractor, will develop antibody-based protein enrichment methods to isolate the plasma membrane-associated Tmem16A channel proteins from acutely isolated native mouse acinar cells, followed by mass spectrometry analysis by the contractor.</p>
<p>3. Project Requirements</p>
<p>Contractor Tasks:</p>
<p>The below tasks are to be executed sequentially.</p>
<p>[1] The contractor and the NIDCR shall develop a customized experimental procedure that addresses several issues associated with enrichment of membrane protein interactomes: (a) highly efficient recovery of membrane proteins from cell lysates while preserving interactions, (b) insolubility and aggregation of membrane proteins during IP and subsequent elution, (c) removal of lipids and other contaminants that may cause signal suppression during electrospray ionization, and (d) compatibility with in-solution digestion, chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric detection;</p>
<p>[2] The contractor shall use MUDPiT (multidimensional protein identification technology) to determine the molecular identifies of the isolated proteins and simultaneously acquires the PTM (post-translation modification) state of these proteins;</p>
<p>[3] The contractor shall use CoPIT (Co-interacting Protein Identification Technology) to determine the specificity of protein interactions in comparison to control experiments for label-free data by using novel methods for unbiased subtraction of background interactions; <br /><br />[4] The contractor and the NIDCR shall use the interactomes from individual experimental conditions to compare against each other to yield differential interactomes based on spectral counting. The Radial Topology Viewer, a visualization tool, graphs interactors, whereby the arithmetic distance to the bait in the center can reflect a dynamic variable of the user's choice, for example confidence of interaction or change in strength of interaction. Additional relational information on protein-protein interactions gathered from other databases can be included to enable the contextual interpretation of a protein interactome;</p>
<p>[5] The contractor and the NIDCR shall confirm the significance of protein interactomes and PTMs identified above by co-expression and mutational functional analysis, respectively.</p>
<p>4. Deliverables</p>
<p>[1] March 14, 2016: Complete the development and use of the customized experimental procedures for efficient recovery of membrane proteins from cell lysates while preserving interactions;</p>
<p>[2] June 14, 2016: MUDPiT and CoPIT analyses will be performed, i.e. the molecular identifies of the isolated proteins and the specificity of protein interactions will be completed;</p>
<p>[3] September 14, 2016: Interactomes from individual experimental conditions will be compared against each other to yield differential interactomes based on spectral counting;</p>
<p>[4] December 14, 2016: The functional significance of protein interactomes will be confirmed by co-expression and mutational analysis;</p>
<p>[5] Interim progess reports will be provided upon request or following a milestone, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>5. Contractor Requirements</p>
<p>a. The contractor will use MUDPiT and CoPIT methodologies developed by the Yates Laboratory. The methods are a combination of customized hardware and unique analyses software. Note that these methods are not available anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>6. Government Requirements</p>
<p>a. The NIDCR will work in conjunction with the contractor to develop a customized experimental procedure, analyze MUDPiT and CoPIT results, and perform experiments to test the significance of protein interactomes and PTMs by co-expression and mutational functional analysis.</p>

<DESC>This Small Business Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research.<br /><br />
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 511120-Periodical Publishers.<br /><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a Market Survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below:<br /><br />Background:<br />The Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) furthers the mission of NIH by emphasizing the critical role that behavior and social factors play in health, health care, and well-being. OBSSR serves as the focal point for coordination and development of goals and objectives in the behavioral and social sciences at NIH. OBSSR is also a liaison between the NIH intramural and extramural communities, other Federal agencies, academic and scientific societies, national voluntary health agencies, the biomedical research community, the media, and the general public on matters pertaining to behavioral and social sciences research. OBSSR's mission is to bring together the biomedical, behavioral, and social science communities to work more collaboratively to solve pressing health challenges facing our nation. OBSSR's plan includes facilitating: a) the next generation of basic behavioral and social sciences research: b) transdisciplinary "team science" that brings together biomedical, behavioral, and social-ecological perspectives; c) research that integrates biologic, behavioral and social drivers of health risk to enable multiple levels of analysis; d) translation of known biologic and behavioral mechanisms into testable and disseminable interventions targeting behaviors which prevent the onset and progression of disease.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to produce a publication for the scientific community on a topic of key interest to OBSSR, NIH program staff, the NIH investigator community, and to health researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. The special issue publication will further the aims of OBSSR by integrating and promoting bio-behavioral and environmental approaches to impact rates of obesity using team science. Specifically, the special issue will contain articles presenting evidence based mechanisms known to impact humans' ability to self-regulate appetite, a central component of healthy weight regulation that can be used to create novel prevention and intervention strategies. Thus the journal in which this special issue is to be published must routinely contain content focusing on diverse multilevel factors effecting obesity, contain clinical content regarding the prevention and treatment of obesity, and serve the intended audience as defined by the interests of OBSSR and NIH program staff.</p>
<p>Obesity is epidemic and is already contributing to exponential increases in related chronic diseases: diabetes, cardiovascular, sleep disturbance, cognitive decline and orthopedic impairment, as examples. Led by OBSSR, and joined by NIDDK, NHLBI, NICHD, NIDA, NCI and the Office of Disease Prevention, a panel of experts was convened July 2015 to present the state of the science regarding evidence based mechanisms that effect self-regulation of appetite, including amount (such as eating after satiation), type of caloric intake and thereby weight regulation. Mechanisms ranged from the cellular/hormonal level, to brain function/decision making, to ecological inputs such as food advertising, external food cues and food policies. Experts presented the state of the science and identified potential targets for novel intervention strategies for regulation of appetite and weight. The next steps for testing the interactive effects of these mechanisms were discussed. Content and proposed targets for intervention spanned the life course and targeted person-based to ecologic non-person factors. As part of its role to disseminate and coordinate behavioral and social sciences to the research and lay community, OBSSR will produce a special issue containing these proceedings.</p>
<p>The proposed special supplemental issue shall provide a unique opportunity to showcase state of the science evidence regarding mechanisms known to effect appetite regulation across disciplines, level, and scope of impact. Presentations by the panel were divided into four (4) major categories: biologic, social, psychological/cognitive, and environmental/policy determinants of appetite regulation. For the purposes of the special issue, content areas shall be collapsed into three (3) topical areas: biologic factors, psychological/cognitive processes, and social determinants of behavior that include policy implementation. Four (4) papers shall be published: an introduction to the topic emphasizing why the meeting was convened, the clinical importance, and common themes going forward; and three (3) synthesis papers presenting mechanistic evidence, discussing potential novel targets for prevention and intervention research, gaps in knowledge, and potential for future multidisciplinary team science.</p>
<p>The special issue shall be guest-edited by the Co-Chairs of the July 2015 meeting and the lead of the NIH working group. Writing committees shall consist of all presentation authors and members of the NIH working group. Papers shall initially be reviewed by the editors and then submitted to the journal for peer review. Manuscripts shall be revised in accordance with peer review and editorial process. The main goal of the publication shall be to disseminate state of the science information regarding the applicability of evidence based mechanisms affecting appetite regulation to inform novel interventions to impact weight homeostasis. The special issue shall indicate NIH's interest in supporting work in this area and alert the community that the Obesity journal encourages cross-disciplinary, multi-level, team science manuscripts on the translation of basic bio-behavioral science into evidence based interventions. This special issue is critical given the need for novel and effective bio-behavioral interventions to prevent and treat obesity.</p>
<p>Mandatory Criteria:<br />The Contractor shall be an academic society that publishes a peer-reviewed research journal that is specific to the special supplemental journal issue research topic and that provides distribution through its journal.</p>
<p>Purpose/Objective:<br />The purpose of this requirement is to obtain the professional services of a Contractor to assist OBSSR in the planning and production of a Special Supplemental Journal Issue of Obesity on "Self- Regulation of Appetite - It's Complicated" in the Obesity journal which shall focus on the use of interactions between evidence based mechanisms impacting self-regulation of appetite in humans to develop novel intervention strategies to prevent and treat obesity. This requirement shall require the support of staff time of the publisher in planning and preparation activities for the special issue. This shall also include staff time for planning activities to include solicitation of reviewers, coordination and preparation of journal layout and content, and support for ongoing planning and editorial management meetings. This requirement shall also include production and dissemination costs.</p>
<p>Contractor Tasks:<br />&#9679;The Contractor shall obtain peer review regarding appropriateness and scientific rigor of the submitted manuscripts. <br />&#9679;After initial peer review, the Contractor shall return manuscripts to the lead author of each paper for revisions and clarifications required by reviewers/journal editors. <br />&#9679;Upon final editorial review, the Contractor shall prepare manuscripts for publication and<br />disseminate to authors for final approval.<br />&#9679;A special issue shall be produced and disseminated through the usual print and web channels used by the Obesity journal.<br />&#9679;All activities shall occur in consultation with the Guest Editors of the special issue and in cooperation with John Wiley &amp; Sons, the journal's official publisher.</p>
<p>Deliverables:<br />The Contractor shall provide the following deliverables:</p>

<DESC>VAAA AIS W2W Performance Enhancement Solution RFI
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.
PURPOSE:
The VA Acquisition Academy's (VAAA) Acquisition Internship School (AIS) located in Frederick MD is seeking information on how an interested Contractor can provide mental skills and peak performance training for the VA's Warrior to Workforce program. The VA is looking for a vendor who has a proven and successful program. The program shall include components that will enable the veteran to:
"	Transition from the military to the civilian federal workforce
"	Cope with potentially significant physical, psychological and emotional challenges following their discharge from the military.
"	Control emotions and respond to any situations
"	Manage and minimize stress    
BACKGROUND:
The Veterans Affairs (VA) Acquisition Academy's Acquisition Internship School's Warriors to Workforce (W2W) program is designed to prepare wounded veterans for a successful transition into a career as a Contract Specialist (GS-1102). This training will provide wounded veterans "interns" with the training and education to support a Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting (FAC-C) Levels I & II and prepare them to become trusted business partners for the Federal Government.  This training program will focus on developing individuals with academic, mental and emotional strengths needed to succeed in their new endeavors.  
In the first year of the program, interns will complete college courses to satisfy the 24 hours of business credits required for the Contract Specialist GS 1102 job series.  During years two and three, interns will receive formal Contracting (CON) courses; formal Professional Development (PROF) courses, and participation in Skill Building (SBLD) activities, wellness training, and job rotation opportunities through the VA.  Interns will also participate in mission service activities and personal development opportunities. At the end of year three, interns will be infused into the VA workforce to meet the needs of contracting organizations throughout the country. 
In addition to the Contract Specialist 1102 training, a critical component of the W2W program is performance training and performance psychology.  We have found performance training and performance psychology are effective complements to the technical training in this developmental program. This approach is supported by the evidence that under conditions of high stress and demand, the ability to manage mental, emotional and physiological responses leads directly to achieving extraordinary performance.  The W2W curriculum provides a mental skills training component that focuses on developing mental and emotional strengths needed to succeed in this challenging career series.  Additionally, the program emphasizes the ability to set and attain goals, to have a positive and optimistic outlook, to thrive under conditions of stress and pressure, to maintain focus and concentration amidst distractions, and to envision successful performance and desired outcomes. 
The purpose of the training is to provide mental skills and performance training for the VA's W2W program.  The mental skills and performance training will develop participants' ability to achieve resilience, self-confidence, adaptability and mental agility.

INFORMATION REQUESTED:
The VAAA AIS is requesting responders provide a capabilities statement describing their program and how it addresses the components listed under the purpose section above. 
Questions concerning this RFI may be submitted to kyle.shaffer@va.gov.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT-- THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE</p>
<p>Project Title: Lebanese Air Force (LAF) Cessna 208 Series Aircraft Maintenance Training</p>
<p>The Air Force Installation Contracting Agency (AFICA) - 338 Specialized Contracting Squadron (SCONS), JBSA-Randolph Texas 78150-4302, announces the intent to award a firm-fixed price contract on a sole source basis to FlightSafety International (FSI) under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 611512 (Flight Training) with a size standard of $27.5M is determined to be the most appropriate for this acquisition. The anticipated period of performance will be 12 months from time of award.</p>
<p>The anticipated award to FSI (Cage Code 1B493) will be issued as a logical follow-on contract to obtain Cessna 208 Series Aircraft Maintenance Training in support of Lebanon's recent Foreign Military Sales (FMS) purchase of the Cessna 208/EX aircraft. With the acquisition of the aircraft, entitlement training for two (2) engine maintenance technicians and one (1) airframe &amp; powerplant mechanic was included in the purchase price and will be provided by FSI. FSI is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) training source provider for entitlement training. However, prerequisite training is required before the entitlement training can be obtained. Under the contemplated contract, FSI will provide the prerequisite training, which includes principals of troubleshooting course, for the Cessna 208 aircraft technicians in preparation for the entitlement and follow-on training to gain full maintenance capability. FSI's continued role as the training provider will ensure there will be no reduction in the level of standardization of maintenance training or operations. Student support services, such as lodging, dining facilities, and transportation, will also be provided by FSI. This contract will only provide training to the two (2) engine maintenance technicians and one (1) airframe &amp; powerplant mechanic (total 3 students) who will be receiving the entitlement training. Any additional students from the LAF that require Cessna 208 Series Aircraft Maintenance Training will not be covered under this sole source contract.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals or quotations. Requests for copies of a solicitation in response to this notice will not be honored or acknowledged. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether conducting a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the government.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice must demonstrate clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government, would not be cost or time prohibitive, and shall also include the following:</p>
<p>a. Description that the interested party can provide and possesses the technical data required to provide the prerequisite Cessna 208 Series Aircraft Maintenance Training in order to obtain the previously purchased entitlement training from FSI as identified above.</p>
<p>b. Description of what services the interested party would perform and what services would need to be subcontracted.</p>
<p>c. Business size of interested party.</p>
<p>To be considered by the government, interested parties must deliver their intent and capabilities to satisfy the government's requirement via email to the Point of Contacts identified below no later than 12:00 PM, Central Daylight Time (CDT) on 28 Jan 2016.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice and/or questions shall be submitted to Samuel Hutchins, Contract Specialist at <a href="mailto:samuel.hutchins.2@us.af.mil">samuel.hutchins.2@us.af.mil</a> and Melissa Gonzalez, Contracting Officer at <a href="mailto:melissa.gonzalez.6@us.af.mil">melissa.gonzalez.6@us.af.mil</a>.</p>

<p><br /><br />Section C - Descriptions and Specifications</p>
<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (July 2013)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY <br />This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES <br />Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS <br />In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below. Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-Ni therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>INTERIM ACCESS <br />The Navy Command' s Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS <br />The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE <br />The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product) <br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out&shy; process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Navy Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO OR PERFORMING NON-SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the United States (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and <br />&bull; Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a FBI fingerprint check prior to installation access.</p>
<p>To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor's Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions <br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or ensure successful FBI fingerprint results have been gained and investigation has been processed with OPM.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>

<DESC>

Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Number: E16PS00024 for Proposed Research on Safety and Technology Verification Research in the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). 

DESCRIPTION: 

The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) Technology Assessment Program (TAP) on Safety and Technology Verification in the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf.  When appropriate, the research shall be conducted consistently with prior research. For a summary of research previously completed and recently performed, visit http://bsee.gov/Research-and-Training/Operational-Safety-and-Engineering.aspx.  Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting white papers. 

BACKGROUND:
 
The BSEE TAP Program is requesting White Papers to be submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement. After review, authors of selected White Papers may be requested to submit full proposals for further consideration.  NOTICE:  BSEE may share the White Papers with other organizations for review.  Potential offerors shall notify the BSEE if they do not want their White Papers/proposals shared outside of BSEE.  BSEE anticipates awards resultant to this announcement will be made on a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) basis. 

OBJECTIVES: 

Responses to this announcement are limited to the following topics: 

TOPIC 1:  Wellbore Thermal Shock Technology

Wellbore Thermal Shock Technology:  Evaluate the effects of Thermal Shock on OCS well integrity and identify ways to mitigate those effects.  If a High Temperature Well (greater than 350 degrees Fahrenheit) is shut in, the well goes into thermal shock when the temperature of the well reaches equilibrium at 35 degrees Fahrenheit (i.e. sea water temperature) and the subsequent thermal stress can cause a loss of well integrity.  Offerors shall describe in detail the thermal effects on wells and the risk of these as related to well integrity (specifically on well barriers) and potential solutions to these risks.  Offerors shall assess any previously released computer models, risk assessments, or failure analyzes prepared on this topic and determine if these analyzes can be used to address the risks related to well integrity on OCS wells.  

TOPIC 2:  Cementing Alternatives Resins

Cementing Alternatives Resins:  Determine how resins can be used for OCS well cementing to improve barrier performance.  A global evaluation of the different types of commercially available resins will be conducted to determine how effective they have been when placed in offshore and onshore wells to affect proper pressure control.  Global evaluation will include an assessment of any available real world data (public and/or private).  An assessment of any regulations in effect on the use of these resins will be conducted among major offshore (e.g. IRF member nations) and onshore oil and gas regulators. Based on the evaluation, the offeror shall propose a draft BSEE regulation addressing use of resins and/or a draft of the major issues an industry standard to this effect should address.  Evaluation will address any cost differential between initial cost of purchasing a resin and use of the resin versus traditional cement costs and use.

TOPIC 3: Liner Seal and Cement Studies

Liner Seal and Cement Studies:  The objective of this topic is to determine the fitness for service for large OD sub mudline liner and casing seal assemblies used for various well designs.  The study will include sub-mudline liner seals; casing seals; cement systems; development of appropriate test validation and verification processes; and development of test protocols for both sub-mudline hanger and liner and casing seal assemblies.  Additionally, this study will help determine what are considered to be physical barriers for shallow liner/casing strings using deep water technology, such as large OD mudline supplemental adapters and hangers; and if the seal-cement system should be considered as a single or dual barrier system for shelf wells.  This study will ultimately lead to the determination if seal-cement systems are adequate as a system and develop regulatory framework and industry standards.

HOW TO RESPOND: 
White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORIGINAL PLUS two (2) copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format, on a CD, shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, Acquisition Operations Branch, 45600 Woodland Road, Mailstop VAE-AMD, Sterling, VA 20166, ATTN: Frank Bennett, not later than 2:00 PM, Eastern Time on 8 February 2016.  WHITE PAPERS SENT THROUGH EMAIL AND FAXES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  White Papers shall define the proposed research scope and include the estimated required level of effort.  COST ESTIMATES SHALL NOT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE WHITE PAPER.  White papers will be selected from all or part of the topics listed depending on the interest and scope of White Papers received.  BSEE will evaluate the responses on technical merit and those deemed to have merit may be selected for a full proposal.  In cases where a white paper is selected for further consideration, a technical and cost/business proposal may be requested from your organization by the BSEE contracting officer.  This announcement constitutes a Request for White Papers, but does not obligate the Government to consummate award. Respondents WILL NOT be notified of the results of the evaluation on the information submitted. 

WHITE PAPERS WILL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:  (1) feasibility of the approach or solution; (2) the Offerors understanding of the technical issues; (3) the Offerors ability to implement the proposed approach; and (4) innovative or creative approaches or solutions including the participation and/or funding by the oil and gas industry or other groups in the research industry, where appropriate. 

IF ANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ARE NOT MET, THE WHITE PAPER WILL NOT BE EVALUATED. Questions shall be e-mailed to Frank.Bennett@bsee.gov no later than 2:00 p.m., Eastern Time on 13 January 2016.  The Solicitation number E16PS00024 MUST be referenced in the subject line of the email. All questions shall include the Solicitation number E16PS00024, your full name and title, your organization, complete address, and telephone and fax numbers. Telephone inquiries WILL NOT be accepted. The White Paper shall identify clearly the Offerors company/organization, point of contact, address, email, telephone and fax numbers. If Offerors desire to hand deliver their White Paper, they are advised that the BSEE facility is a secure office complex and Offerors SHALL NOT enter the building beyond the lobby. There is a courtesy telephone at the guard station to which you shall call extension 7-1633 or 7-1070 for a procurement representative to meet and receive your submittal. You MUST contact Frank Bennett at Frank.Bennett@bsee.gov and set up an appointment 24 hours in advance of dropping off your White Paper. 

POINT OF CONTACT: Frank Bennett, Contracting Officer, email: Frank.Bennett@bsee.gov

<DESC><p>Proposers' Day Announcement</p>
<p>The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on the SuperTools program, and on the research problems the program aims to address, to address questions from potential proposers, and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.</p>
<p>The SuperTools program aims to develop a comprehensive set of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools to enable Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) design of Superconducting Electronics (SCE). The program seeks to enable the design and modeling of very-large-scale SCE circuits needed to build a prototype superconducting computer. SuperTools is envisioned as a five year program. The three-year goal of the SuperTools program is to develop a capability that supports the design of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), co-processors and other similar devices. The five-year goal is to support the design of a 64-bit Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) microprocessor from design concept to tape-out. The SuperTools program will also develop physics-based Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) tools and establish Standard Cell Library templates for SCE to bridge collaboration between SCE foundries and IC designers.</p>

<p>Research supported and conducted by NIAID strives to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the myriad of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Clinical Research (DCR) supports clinical research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics.</p>
<p>As the leading U.S. government institute for HIV/AIDS and other infectious disease (ID) research, NIAID is committed to conducting the research necessary to successfully end the fight against HIV/AIDS and combat emerging and re-emerging ID.   The DCR research support portfolio includes the oversight of select clinical research projects involving investigational and marketed products and agents.  LBRI plays a significant role in many of these clinical research projects by providing project management, regulatory, clinical trials management, laboratory, and programmatic support (i.e., IL-15 Project, Southeast Asia Clinical Research Network, Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases, Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers, Respiratory and Non-Respiratory Illnesses).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Examination IL-15</strong></span></p>
<p>Promoting basic research and development (R&amp;D) is essential to the advancement of scientific discovery. DCR is currently supporting a R&amp;D initiative for the development and testing of IL-15, which may be beneficial as an immune-based therapy for HIV infection.  DCR recognizes the value of investing in basic R&amp;D and continues to expand its research portfolio to include R&amp;D of therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics.</p>
<p>IL-15 is a cytokine; cytokines are small proteins that are secreted by specific cells of the immune system and carry signals locally between cells.  The IL-15 cytokine induces proliferation and differentiation of cytotoxic cells whose principal role is to kill virally infected or cancer cells.  The NIAID requires the analysis of IL-15 or similar as part of the initial evaluation of the utility of IL-15 or similar cytokines for the potential clinical safety and efficacy in treating patients infected with HIV or other infectious agents.  This analysis will also include any cytokines that may be related to or perturbed in response to IL-15 in Vivo or in Vitro.  The anticipated length of this project will be 2-5 years in duration and may support a portfolio of studies.</p>
<p>Phenotypic and molecular testing of cells, tissues, and/or infectious agents obtained from small animal model or patients will include, but not limited to, flow cytometry, cell sorting, genetic sequencing, virus isolation, and characterization may be requested.  Detailed analysis of the data produced by such testing will also be required.</p>
<p>LBRI is seeking innovative solutions for the examination of the utility of IL-15 for inhibition of HIV replication both In Vitro and In Vivo. These innovative solutions should be described in detail and scope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Interested parties are encouraged to respond to this Request for Information S16-100 and provide the following information.  Interested parties may respond to both the IL-15 and IL-27, requests or one or the other.  Please specify in your response if you are responding to one or the other, or both.</p>

<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Examination IL-27</strong></span></p>
<p>Promoting basic research and development (R&amp;D) is essential to the advancement of scientific discovery. DCR is currently supporting a R&amp;D initiative for the development and testing of IL-27, which may be beneficial as an immune-based therapy for HIV infection.  DCR recognizes the value of investing in basic R&amp;D and continues to expand its research portfolio to include R&amp;D of therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics.</p>
<p>DCR intends to launch this project with an initial study involving IL-27; however, similar cytokines could be studied if interesting scientific findings are discovered as part of this initial project.  IL-27 is a heterodimeric cytokine that preferentially inhibits HIV-1 replication in monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs), one of the suspected reservoirs for HIV infection.  IL-27 significantly induces interferon-related antiviral genes in MDMs and has been shown capable of inhibiting SIV infection in non-human primate MDMs.  The anticipated length of this project will be 2-5 years in duration and may support a portfolio of studies.</p>
<p>The NIAID requires the analysis of IL-27 or similar as part of the initial evaluation of the utility of IL-27 or similar cytokines for the potential clinical safety and efficacy in treating patients infected with HIV or other infectious agents.  This analysis will also include any cytokines that may be related to or perturbed in response to IL-27 in Vivo or in Vitro.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with AB Sciex LLC, North American Sales and Service, 1201 Radio Road, Redwood City, CA 94065 to provide a Maintenance Service Agreement (MSA) for the 4800 Maldi TOF/TOF Analyzer.  The EPA laboratory at Research Triangle Park, NC has been equipped with the 4800 Maldi TOF/TOF Analyzer.  The service plan includes parts, labor and travel for remedial repair; 2 PM visits; guaranteed priority response time 2 business days after receipt of service call; priority telephone and email access to instrument technical support; telephone and email access to application technical support and smart services remote monitoring, which provides for notification to customer of instrument failures or errors that are reported by smart services monitoring software.  AB Sciex, LLC is the sole manufacturer of the 4800 Maldi TOF/TOF Analyzer that includes proprietary hardware and can only be serviced by AB Sciex, LLC.  EPA believes that this is the only vendor capable of satisfying the requirement for this particular instrument.  In addition, AB Sciex has the exclusive rights to the software, hardware, and operating licenses for this equipment.  It would therefore be impossible to maintain proper functioning of the instrument without AB Sciex support.  In addition, it is neither possible nor cost effective to identify additional sources for hardware or software replacements in the event of a problem. Therefore, the Government intends to process service contract through AB Sciex without full and open competition.  The circumstances permitting Soliciting From A Single Source at this time is FAR 13.106-1(2)(b).  The anticipated period of performance is 12 months.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required maintenance agreement may submit a written qualifications statement which fully explains their capabilities within 5 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will not be considered.  The information received to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Louis C. Williams, Jr. (MC-AA005), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 109 Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) intends to award a sole-source modification to contract N00039-14-C-5245 to Ridgewood Technology Partners, LLC. Ridgewood will perform additional engineering to integrate application hosting and to address cybersecurity requirements.

The vendor shall provide software updates, software integration and testing, system administration and full life cycle support for the COMPASS Application. The contract as-written provides coverage through September 29, 2016. This proposed modification increases the value of the contract by $453,222 but does not extend the period of performance.

Given the above information, the contract modification will be awarded pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 230-4(c)(1). The proposed contract action includes services for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or a solicitation of offers. However, all expressions of interest received within fifteen days after the date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Any submissions will not be reimbursed by the Government and the entire costs of any submission will be at the sole expense of the source submitting the information. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This synopsis is for informational purposes only. Any expressions of interest shall be submitted to Ian Robinson, Contract Specialist, at ian.robinson1@navy.mil
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541512.

<DESC>This announcement is notice that the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Polar Icebreaker Replacement Program intends to host an Industry Day followed by one-on-one meetings with prospective shipbuilders and ship designers as a part of ongoing market research. <br /><br />Both the industry day and one-on-one meetings will be held in the Washington, DC metro area. Industry Day is tentatively planned to occur in March 2016. The one-on-one sessions will be scheduled to take place in the weeks following Industry Day. <br /><br />An announcement detailing specific locations, times, and response requirements will be posted at a later date. <br /><br />In advance of these details, the USCG is releasing a draft data package that includes a notional program schedule, notional Polar Icebreaker requirements, and questions that the Government intends to discuss during the one-on-one meetings.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Limited Access/Export Controlled Data Package</span><br /><br /><br />The draft data package is subject to Export Control limitations, and is deemed a "limited access" and "export controlled" package within the FBO system. Vendors will require an "explicit access" grant by the USCG in order to view the document via the FBO system. To be granted access to this draft data package, vendors must be certified as a US or Canadian contractor by the Joint Certification Program (JCP) administered by the Defense Logistic Information Service (DLIS). <br /><br />Instructions and procedures for being certified by JCP can be found at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/. Only those vendors that have current certification by JCP will be able to be granted explicit access to the draft data package by the USCG. The USCG does not intend to grant vendors access to these documents outside of the FBO site.</p>

If shipment is made by insured parcel post, the contractor must furnish a copy of the Insured Mail Receipt issued by the US Postal Service. Otherwise, a stamped copy of a Certificate of Mailing issued by the US Postal Service must be furnished. If shipment is made by a common carrier (rail, air or motor freight), the Contractor must furnish a signed copy of the shipping document on which items are receipted for by the common carrier. A signed receipt by a NAFI representative at the delivery point, Consolidation Containerization Point or Port of Embarkation is also acceptable evidence of proof of shipment.</p>

<p>c. Notwithstanding any provisions of this clause or any payment made pursuant to the terms of this clause prior to receipt of the items contracted for, the NAFI retains the right to inspect upon receipt and the right to reject nonconforming items. The liability of the Contractor with respect to items for which payments have been made will, after inspection by the NAFI or after the expiration of a reasonable time following delivery to the NAFI within which inspection may be made, whichever occurs first, be limited to exceptions taken at the time of inspection, and latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as amount to fraud.</p>

Payments and penalties for late payments are subject to the requirements established by the Prompt Payment Act, as amended, and as implemented for NAFIs. If the NAFI makes payment but such payment fails to include a prompt payment penalty due to the Contractor within 10 days from when the contract payment is made, penalty amounts will not be paid unless the Contractor makes a written request within forty days after the date of payment.</p>
<p>26. DISCOUNTS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT</p>
<p>a. Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of offers. However, any offered discount will form a part of the award, and will be taken if payment is made within the discount period indicated in the offer by the offeror. As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices.</p>
<p>b. In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified payment date. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day.</p>
<p><br />27. NOTIFICATION OF DEBARMENT/SUSPENSION STATUS</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide immediate notice to the Contracting Officer in the event of being suspended, debarred or declared ineligible by any other Federal Department or agency, or upon receipt of a notice of proposed debarment from another DoD Agency, during the performance of this contract.</p>
<p><br />28. NON WAIVER OF DEFAULTS - Any failure by the NAFI at any time to enforce or require strict performance of any terms or conditions shall not constitute waiver thereof, and shall not affect or impair such terms or conditions in any way or the NAFI's right at any time to avail itself of such remedies as it may have for any breach or breaches of such terms or conditions.</p>
<p>29. TRAVEL CLAUSE</p>

Travel costs will be paid by the contracting NAFI, up to the maximum amount authorized in the federal travel regulations. The contractor shall submit original receipts of airline tickets, lodging, car rental and other expenses exceeding $75.00. Contractor personnel must acquire airline travel by the most economical methods, to include obtaining coach fares, buy advance purchase tickets (when possible), and plan minimal travel time necessary to accomplish the task. The contractor is liable for costs associated with unused or changed airline tickets, where non-use is not caused by the NAFI. Documents are required to support payment of travel costs. The Contracting Officer and or their duly appointed representative will approve, in advance, any changes in the itinerary. Contractors must obtain approval before submitting other than lowest airfare travel reimbursement requests from the invoicing office. Local travel for which mileage is claimed; to include travel to and from the airport when air travel is involved must be indicated on the itinerary on form 1351-2 or other approved form.</p>

(a)  Each service employee, laborer, or mechanic employed in the United States (the 50 States and the District of Columbia) in the performance of this contract by the prime Contractor or any subcontractor, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the Contractor and service employee, laborer, or mechanic, shall be paid not less than the applicable minimum wage under Executive Order 13658. The minimum wage required to be paid to each service employee, laborer, or mechanic performing work on this contract between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2015, shall be $10.10 per hour.
(b) The Contractor shall adjust the minimum wage paid under this contract each time the Secretary of Labor's annual determination of the applicable minimum wage under section 2(a)(ii) of Executive Order 13658 results in a higher minimum wage. Adjustments to the Executive Order minimum wage under section 2(a)(ii) of Executive Order 13658 will be effective for all service employees, laborers, or mechanics subject to the Executive Order beginning January 1 of the following year. The Secretary of Labor will publish annual determinations in the Federal Register no later than 90 days before such new wage is to take effect. The Secretary will also publish the applicable minimum wage on www.wdol.gov (or any successor website). The applicable published minimum wage is incorporated by reference into this contract.
(c) The Contracting Officer will adjust the contract price or contract unit price under this clause only for the increase in labor costs resulting from the annual inflation increases in the Executive Order 13658 minimum wage beginning on January 1, 2016.

(d) The Contracting Officer will not adjust the contract price under this clause for any costs other than those identified in paragraph (c) of this clause, and will not provide price adjustments under this clause that result in duplicate price adjustments with the respective clause of this contract implementing the Service Contract Labor Standards statute (formerly known as the Service Contract Act) or the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute (formerly known as the Davis Bacon Act).

If occupational diseases are not compensable under those statutes, they shall be covered under the employer's liability section of the insurance policy, except when contract operations are so commingled with a Contractor's commercial operations that it would not be practical to require this coverage.  Employer's liability coverage of at least $100,000 is required, except in States with exclusive or monopolistic funds that do not permit workers' compensation to be written by private carriers.
            (b)  General Liability: $500,000 per occurrences.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>This solicitation, NB686010-16-00770, is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-85.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516, with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This is unrestricted and all interested parties may submit a quotation. It is being issued using the simplified acquisition procedures under the authority of FAR 13.5 Certain Commercial Items.</p>
<p>This combined synopsis/solicitation is for the following commercial item(s):</p>
<p>CLIN 0001: One (1) Custom Integrating Sphere per the attached Specifications</p>
<p><br />Description of requirements for the items to be acquired:</p>
<p>National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Division 686 is developing a calibration system for the US Air Force. The Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) provides a means of scanning a broad range of wavelengths and with accessories, a method of determining the reflectance of a surface, such as that of a thermal laser detector.</p>
<p>NIST proposes a reflectance-based spectral characterization of thermal and pyroelectric detectors using a broadband source with a FTS-based characterization. Combining this with an existing laser-based single-wavelength absolute responsivity measurement will yield an infrared spectral radiometer ("IR Radiometer") providing the Air Force eventually with "in house" capability to calibrate the absolute responsivity of laser power meters from 0.9 &#61549;m to 25 &#61549;m with traceability to NIST.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: <br />The Contractor shall provide one (1) Custom Integrating Sphere to develop a calibration system for the US Air Force as described below and per the attached Specifications.</p>
<p>The integrating sphere accessory to the Fourier Transform Spectrometer shall meet the minimum government requirements listed below along with the attached Specifications.</p>
<p>1. The integrating sphere shall be 4" to 6" (100 to 150) mm diameter, commensurate with appropriate signal to noise ratio as obtained from samples that have a total hemispherical reflectance of 0.2 % to 5 %, on samples no greater than 19 mm x 19 mm area.<br />2. The integrating sphere shall operate over the wavelength range from 0.9 &micro;m to 25 &micro;m.<br />3. The sphere shall be capable of performing 8 degree total hemispherical reflectance measurements and specular excluded measurements.<br />4. The sphere shall have demountable fittings for a D315 / D316 detector from Bruker Instruments. There is the possibility of using a larger active area detector from another supplier to enhance the signal to noise ratio. This will be discussed at time of purchase.<br />5. The centre of the entrance port of the sphere shall be at the same height as the centre of the exit port of the FTS.<br />6. There shall be a spare port at the top of the sphere.<br />7. The entrance port to the sphere shall be no larger than 25 mm and the exit port no larger than 20 mm. It is expected existing ports will be reduced to these dimensions.<br />8. A plugged port shall exist for specular excluded measurements.<br />9. The sphere shall be mounted remote to the FTS on a small breadboard with &frac14; - 20 mounting holes, spaced on a 1" pattern. This could be a small commercial breadboard.<br />10. The radiation from the exit port of the FTS shall be coupled into the sphere with external gold coated reflective optics to maintain maximum signal. These reflective optics will be required to reduce the diameter of the optical beam from the FTS (nominally 40 mm diameter) to approximately 20 mm diameter at the entrance port of the sphere and no larger than 15 mm, but greater than 5 mm at the exit port of the sphere. The total free space path distance from the FTS to the entrance port of the sphere shall not be greater than 0.75 m. This path could be folded. The optics should minimize optical signal loss.<br />11. The sphere shall be mounted to a rotating stage that is mounted to the breadboard, allowing for rotational movement about the entrance port. The control of this stage shall be integrated with the FTS software.<br />12. The operation of the sphere and signal out from the MCT detector shall be integrated with the Bruker V70 FTS software - this includes automatic recognition of the detector being used.<br />13. Normal transmission measurement of samples shall be possible with this sphere.<br />14. Sphere shall include removable sample holders for sample (reflection), transmission and comparison ports. <br />15. There will be an enclosure for the sphere system with appropriate beam ports and bulk head connections for electronics so the optical measurements can be made in a dark ambient environment. Enclosure will include nitrogen line &frac14;" NPT nipples for potential N2 flushing of system (positive pressure, not a sealed vessel).</p>
<p><br />BASIS OF AWARD:</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable quoter. This will be a firm fixed price purchase order to the responsible contractor submitting a quote that meets all of the requirements of this RFQ and who has the lowest price.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITY: <br />Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. Documentation submitted in the quotation shall be evaluated to determine that the proposed equipment meets or exceeds the Governments minimum required specifications. Failure to clearly and unambiguously demonstrate this will result in an "unacceptable" technical rating.</p>
<p>PRICE: <br />Price shall be evaluated for reasonableness.</p>
<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Offerors shall meet the technical specifications and deliverable schedule.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. (Quotes shall be evaluated in accordance with the criteria shown above).</p>

<CONTACT>Katherine Koleski, Research Director, Phone 202-624-1482, Fax 202-624-1406, Email kkoleski@uscc.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS:<br />January 13, 2016<br /><br />PERIOD OF PROPOSAL SUBMISSION ENDS:<br />February 2, 2016
<p><br />ABOUT PROPOSALS. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter "the Commission") invites submission of proposals to provide a one-time unclassified report on China's industrial and military robotics development.</p>
<p>ABOUT THE COMMISSION. The Commission was established by Congress in 2000 to monitor and report to Congress on the economic and national security dimensions of the United States' trade and economic ties with the People's Republic of China. Further details about the Commission are available on its website at: www.uscc.gov.</p>
<p>The Commission solicits this research pursuant to its Congressional mandate (contained in P.L. 113-291, Section 1259B), which states, "The Commission ... shall investigate and report ... on..."</p>
<p>"(B) The qualitative and quantitative nature of the transfer of United States production activities to the People's Republic of China, including the relocation of manufacturing, advanced technology and intellectual property, and research and development facilities, the impact of such transfers on the national security of the United States (including the dependence of the national security industrial base of the United States on imports from China), the economic security of the United States, and employment in the United States, and the adequacy of United States export control laws in relation to the People's Republic of China."</p>
<p>"(D) Foreign investment ...by the People's Republic of China in the United States, including an assessment of its economic and security implications, [and] the challenges to market access confronting potential United States investment in the People's Republic of China..."</p>
<p>"(E) The military plans, strategy and doctrine of the People's Republic of China ... the interaction between the civilian and military leadership in the People's Republic of China ... resources available to the People's Republic of China military (including the development and execution of budgets and the allocation of funds), force modernization objectives and trends for the People's Republic of China military, and the implications of such objectives and trends for the national security of the United States."</p>
<p>"(H) The drivers, nature, and implications of the growing economic, technological, ... and security relations of the People's Republic of China's with other countries, regions, and international and regional entities (including multilateral organizations), including the relationship among the United States, Taiwan, and the People's Republic of China."</p>
<p>"(I) The compliance of the People's Republic of China with its commitments to the World Trade Organization, other multilateral commitments, bilateral agreements signed with the United States, commitments made to bilateral science and technology programs, and any other commitments and agreements strategic to the United States (including agreements on intellectual property rights and prison labor imports), and United States enforcement policies with respect to such agreements."</p>
<p>The report's key research requirements are:</p>
<p>1. Assess trends in China's adoption of industrial robots, especially in the manufacturing industry. What policies (e.g., Made in China 2025) promote these trends, and what factors (e.g., demographic changes) drive the policies behind those trends? What are the current and potential future impacts of China's adoption of industrial robots on the Chinese economy? In what Chinese industries has the adoption of robot technology been most prevalent? What are the main obstacles to increased factory automation in China, if any? What is the potential impact of China's workforce automation on U.S. and global labor markets? On U.S. firms with manufacturing plants in China? Compare and contrast China's adoption of industrial robots with that of its major manufacturing competitors. Assess any other economic implications for the United States of the adoption of industrial robots in China.</p>
<p>2. Assess China's domestic industrial and service robot production and consumption. How does the Chinese market for robots, including robots with industrial and service applications, compare with other global markets? What percent of industrial and service robots in the world are produced by China, respectively? How does China's robot production compare with other leading producers? What percent of robots produced by China are consumed domestically? How many Chinese companies produce industrial robots, and what are their market shares domestically and internationally? What share of components or technology used in Chinese industrial and service robots is sourced from the United States or other foreign countries? Identify key suppliers of components and chips. Are U.S. or other foreign investors engaged in production in China and, if so, what is the nature of their activities? Is market access for foreign investors conditioned on transfer of technology or localization of research and development (R&amp;D) centers? Are foreign firms entering the market through joint ventures or other relationships with Chinese firms, and if so, what kinds of Chinese firms (SOEs, etc.)? How are China's professional service robots contributing to service sector development?</p>
<p>3. Assess the state of robotics R&amp;D in China, including nanorobotics R&amp;D. How does the state of robotics R&amp;D in China compare with that of the United States and other leaders in robotics technology? What challenges does China face in enhancing its technological competitiveness in robotics R&amp;D? To what extent do Chinese robotics technologies rely on U.S. or other imported software, components or other technology? Identify key suppliers of components and chips. What programming languages are being used in robotics R&amp;D in China? To what extent are Chinese and foreign researchers partnering in China on robotics R&amp;D? What are the leading research organizations, companies, universities, or other entities involved in robotics R&amp;D in China? Are they linked to Chinese government entities or the People's Liberation Army (PLA)? On which applications and technologies is their research focused? Identify any affiliations they may have with U.S. companies or universities. Identify any research partnerships between Chinese entities with links to the PLA and foreign entities. Which developments in commercial robotics in China have the greatest potential for military application? Assess China's use of robotics in different domains (e.g., undersea, air, space).</p>
<p>4. a. Assess the level of interest of the Chinese government and the PLA in the military applications of robotics. What are the trends in the PLA's adoption of robotics? What potential military applications of robotics are Chinese researchers studying? What are the leading research organizations, companies, universities, or other entities involved in military robotics R&amp;D in China? Evaluate which applications are the most likely to be adopted by the PLA. Identify any discussion by Chinese researchers of the potential challenges inherent to the military applications of robotics. What systems, if any, have been deployed?</p>
<p>b. Assess Chinese robotics development strategies and their use in potentially countering present or future U.S. military capabilities and strategies (including the Department of Defense's "Third Offset"). In what areas is China already ahead of the United States in the use or development of robotics with military applications? What U.S. or other dual-use robotics technologies have likely been acquired by China through technology transfers or cyber penetrations? How can the United States maintain key advantages in the development and production of dual-use robotics technologies?</p>
<p>5. Assess the state of artificial intelligence R&amp;D in China. What are the leading research organizations, companies, universities, or other entities involved in artificial intelligence R&amp;D in China? On what applications and technologies is Chinese research focused? What potential commercial, lifestyle, and military applications of artificial intelligence are Chinese researchers studying? Evaluate which applications are the most likely to be adopted by the PLA. Identify any discussion by Chinese researchers of the potential problems of the military applications of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>6. Assess the state of R&amp;D on unmanned aerial, maritime (both surface and underwater), and land systems in China. Compare the most advanced Chinese systems to the most advanced systems used by the United States. To what degree do Chinese unmanned systems demonstrate improvements over foreign systems and breakthroughs in unmanned technology? How much does Chinese R&amp;D on these systems focus on autonomous operation? Describe Chinese efforts to turn existing manned military platforms into unmanned systems. Identify Chinese research that might yield innovative military applications and unique military capabilities for the PLA in the area of unmanned systems.</p>
<p>The report should include an executive summary of the report's key findings; a brief overview of the sources and analytic methodology used for the report; and a brief explanation of the scope and limitations of the report.</p>
<p>Additional Requirements:</p>
<p>1. Prior to the award of any contract, the contractor must be registered in the federal System for Award Management (SAM).</p>
<p>2. Once the Commission selects a contractor for this project, and a contract is signed, public notice of this will be made on the Commission's website.</p>
<p>3. The Commission's goal is to have a report prepared for review in a timely fashion. In ordinary circumstances, once the Commission selects a contractor and a contract is signed, a draft report must be submitted to the Commission for review no later than 120 days from the date the contract is signed. The Commission will then endeavor to provide comments and requests for adjustments within 30 days; subsequently, the final report must be submitted within 30 days of formal receipt of the Commission's comments. The Commission recognizes, under certain circumstances, a contractor may wish to have more time to prepare the first draft of the report under the contract. The contractor, in their contract proposal, should stipulate the time frame for submission of the draft report. It is to be understood; however, that time is of the essence in completing research contracts for the Commission.</p>
<p>4. As work on the report progresses, the Commission's Research Director shall act as the Commission's representative in monitoring the progress, quality, and responsiveness of the report to the major issues of concern identified in this Request for Proposals (RFP). The Research Director shall, on request to the contractor, be entitled to informal briefings on the status of the research work and to readings of the draft in progress.</p>
<p>5. The report shall be free of typographical errors and conform to the Chicago Manual of Style. Upon receipt of all drafts, the Commission will inspect the document for typographical errors and deviations from the Chicago Manual of Style guidelines. At the discretion of the Commission, if a draft contains excessive deficiencies, the Commission will return the draft to the contractor and request the contractor cure the draft of deficiencies within five (5) working days (not counting weekends and Federal holidays). Upon resubmission of the draft by the contractor to the Commission, should deficiencies remain, the Commission, at its discretion, will submit the draft to its copyeditor for correction, the cost of which ($43.98 per hour) will be deducted from the final cost of the contract. The contract shall be subject to termination if the Commission deems that the work is of unsatisfactory quality.</p>
<p>6. At the Commission's discretion, the report procured via this RFP may be posted on the Commission's website.</p>
<p>7. Each organization or individual responding to this request must warrant they will perform this work solely for the Commission, and the resulting report will not be shared with other parties without the prior written consent of the Commission.</p>
<p>8. The Commission expects contractors to identify all personnel working on the contract, and that there will not be any delegation of responsibilities to other parties without prior written approval of the Commission.</p>
<p>9. After completion of the report, the Commission staff, in consultation with the contractor, will prepare a short summary of the research for posting on the Commission's website and other media. The Commission staff shall consult with the contractor in preparing said document.</p>
<p>10. At the discretion and request of the Commission, the contractor shall agree to participate in up for four (4) separate briefings, and up to one (1) public hearing, held by the Commission, of up to two (2) hours each in the Washington, DC area, supported by at least one (1) individual affiliated with the contractor identified as "key personnel." This could include, but not necessarily be limited to, briefing the content of the research to Commissioners and Commission staff, appearing as witnesses at a public hearing held by the Commission, and briefing the content of the research to Members of Congress and/or their staff. No additional remuneration will be provided to the contractor for these briefings or a hearing. The Commission will make a good faith effort to schedule briefings and a hearing at times that are subject to mutual agreement.</p>
<p>Primary Selection Criteria:</p>
<p>1. The Commission will determine which organization or individual responding to this request will be awarded the contract based on a comprehensive "best value" analysis of the proposals received, to include costs, technical value, and ability to complete the work satisfactorily and on time, and past performance with the Commission, if applicable.</p>
<p>2. The primary weighting criterion in selection shall be the assessed qualifications and ability of an organization or individual to address the fundamental research points enunciated above ("key research requirements").</p>
<p>3. The cost and amount of time necessary to complete the report will also be considered as criteria in the selection process.</p>
<p>Proposal submissions should include:</p>
<p>1. A statement of the applicant's relevant qualifications to satisfy the terms of this RFP, to include curricula vitae for personnel intended for work on the project.</p>
<p>2. Identification of the principal researchers who will be responsible for the preparation of the report. It is understood that the designation of the researchers is a critical element of the proposal, and any changes regarding which individuals will be involved in the report's preparation must be approved by the Commission in advance and in writing.</p>
<p>3. A description of the research methodology the applicant proposes to employ. In describing methodology, the submission should provide detailed descriptions of the sources and methods that will be used to research the report's topic and the extent to which Chinese language sources, if any, and other primary materials will be used.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. <br /><br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br /><br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Price - The total proposed price (the total of all contract line item prices),</p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Technical - Proposal conforms to the "Bill of Materials" and deliver schedule. It is the Government's intent to award on an "all or none" basis to satisfy this requirement.</p>
<p><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Past Performance - Acceptable past performance.</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>(e) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e), in all subcontracts.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Yes, It should be all inclusive.  With the understanding that if the repair costs totals from all previous repairs are greater than 50% the cost of new (Per VHA guidelines). The repair may not be authorized and only the initial repair evaluation will be paid.


CLIN 0005/Delivery for Bariatric Setup - The current contract has an hourly rate for Bariatric set ups. For this Solicitation, is this a set rate?
	
Yes, there is a set rate for this solicitation.

Telehealth is included in the Solicitation. Telehealth was included in the 2013 DME Solicitation but was determined to be unnecessary due to a national contract.  Does the inclusion of Telehealth in this Solicitation indicate that this will actually be performed?
	
As stated in the Solicitation, the government anticipates that the set-up and instruction of VA-owned tele-health equipment will be required.

Page 20 of the Solicitation states that "This is not an option year contract.  The period of performance for this contract is Date of Award through 9-30-2020." Does this indicate a four year contract? How does this differ from the current contract which is a one year contract with annual renewals? The value of all task orders that may be placed against this Contract during its 5-year period is estimated to be: Minimum Value: $ 80,000.00 Maximum Value: $2,230,291.00 (All funds are subject to the availability of funds per clause 53.232-19). This is not an option year contract. The period of performance for this contract is Date of Award through 09-30-2020. Even if the contract were to be awarded on the due date of Friday, January 15, 2016, the period of performance ending on September 30, 2020 would only be a four year and eight month contract. Will the end date be extended upon award to make this a full five-year contract?
	
This is NOT an option year contract. This contract will not require modifications to be completed on every anniversary date of the contract. The end date will NOT be extended upon award to make this a full five-year contract.



Please clarify how much weight does socioeconomic status play in this Solicitation? Since this is a best value procurement, non-veteran companies need to know how critical it is to acquire/propose subcontractors who meet the service-disabled or veteran-owned status to be evaluated fairly. Can the Government assign a point value to this factor for evaluation purposes? If not, can a better definition of full credit, partial credit, minimal credit or no credit be provided? Will a non-veteran company be penalized or rated lower for receiving no credit or N/A for this factor?
	
As it is stated in the Solicitation, page 71, "Technical Capability and Past Performance are significantly more important than Socio-Economic Program Participation AND Price." The Government will NOT assign a point value to the factor for evaluation purposes. The solicitation does NOT clearly state how the factors are evaluated; Technical, Past Performance, and Socio-Economic Status will be assigned an ADJECTIVAL rating, but price will not be assigned and adjectival rating or scored (pg. 74).
A non-Veteran company will not be penalized or rated lower for receiving no credit or N/A for this factor.


Page 15 of the Solicitation states that Delivery Certification Form must be sent on the same day of delivery. Are there exceptions for staff not returning until after 5:00 p.m.?  Can Delivery Certifications be sent within one business day? How should it be sent - PKI email or fax?
	
Yes, exceptions will be made for staff not returning until after 5:00 p.m. Delivery certifications can be sent the next business day either by PKI email or fax. 

Page 13 of the Solicitation includes feeding pumps and grabs bars. Will these be provided under the Solicitation?  Will installation of grab bars be required?
	
Feeding pumps are provided under DME for VA Pittsburgh and Butler. There are separate Contractors who will install the grab bars. Currently this is not a part of our contract. 

Page 14/Emergency Repairs - Is the referenced loaner coming out of VA inventory.  What is expected if no suitable loaner is available?
  	
Yes, the referenced is to come out of VA loaner inventory. Expectations are that each Veteran is provided a manual back-up to be used for down time of their power chair. On some occasions this manual chair will not provide adequate coverage and a power loaner chair will be needed. If an appropriate one is not in stock, then this will be looked at on a case by case basis.


Just wondering if there is an approximate volume of equipment that would need to be picked up in 10 days from the current provider.  For instance, is it 1,000 sq. ft. worth, etc.	
Butler has about 8 hospital beds and mattresses. Over the bed table, trapeze, shower bench, shower chair, bedside commode (no more the 4 of each of these).
Pittsburgh has about 2000 square feet of space necessary for DME operations.


For Each Line Item (CLIN) you have a service required, with a quantity, unit, unit price and amount. An example is Line Item 0001, which shows Vehicle transport and pick-up of DME within counties listed in PWS, with a quantity of 1,600, unit of Each. The question is, are the quantities monthly or annually?
	
Each CLIN indicates a quantity that is estimated annually. For example, CLIN 0001 indicates the estimated quantity for Year 1 of the contract (Date of award to 9-30-2016), and CLIN 1001 indicates the estimated quantity for Year 2 of the contract (10-1-2016 to 9-30-2017). This is the same throughout the Price Schedule. 

3. The HOUR and DATE proposals are due remains unchanged at January 15, 2016; 1:00 P.M. E.S.T.
4. Offerors are reminded "Failure to acknowledge receipt of this amendment may result in rejection of your offer.

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p>AFICA 772 Enterprise Sourcing Squadron <br />SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE/ REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFI)</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS ISSUED AS A SOURCES SOUGHT/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ANNOUCEMENT FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. This notice DOES NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation (RFQ), Invitation for Bid (IFB), solicitation, complete package outlining the technical competencies/qualifications of the prospective contractor, nor does it represent any commitment by the Government. Since this is a Sources Sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement. No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation. A solicitation does not presently exist. The Air Force will not accept or acknowledge: emails over 5MB, brochures, samples, catalogs, and any other marketing solicitation information. Following submittals of this capability package, USAF representatives may choose to engage in additional communications with selected respondents only intended to support market research for further clarification of industry capability to meet requirements.</p>
<p>The United States Air Force (USAF) is looking to replace aging, commercially-off-the-shelf (COTS) survey and mapping equipment [Total Station, Global Navigation Satellite System/Global Positioning System (GNSS/GPS), Machine Control] with similar but more modernized COTS solutions specifically designed for construction and geodetic/mapping purposes. Remote-sensing technologies aimed at producing a high return on investment and improve the efficiency and practices of infrastructure development, planning, construction, and managing the natural environment are regarded favorably.</p>
<p>It is our intent to purchase equipment including companion software, and peripherals required for the equipment to function in its intended capacity. Additionally the vendor must be able to provide logistics support to include software updates, maintenance, repair, replacement, and training.</p>
<p>The total number of units to be procured will depend on a number of factors, which include the availability of funding between Fiscal Years 2016-2020; however, fielding is scheduled at over 100 USAF installations worldwide.</p>
<p>Companies are requested to identify if and explain how their equipment and software is compatible with the USAF Civil Engineer's current inventory. A list of existing equipment can be found in Attachment 1. Additionally, all companies are requested to identify if their equipment is Buy-American Act compliant.</p>
<p>Interested companies should look at Attachment 2 and provide information for all the questions listed.</p>
<p>The Government is performing market research primarily in order to determine if there are firms that possess the capability to execute the requirements of this request for information (RFI). Therefore, we further invite all business concerns to provide a capability statement in response to this requirement. Prospective contractors shall be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award of any Federal Government contract. Contractors are encouraged to obtain further information on SAM registration at the following website: https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. This announcement does not obligate the Government to award a contract nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any preparation costs.<br />If your firm would be interested in such work, you are strongly encouraged to submit a capability statement that addresses as a minimum, the questions presented within this announcement, and also fill out and submit the attached questionnaire by the due date. The Government does not intend to rank submittals or provide any reply to interested firms. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334519 - Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing, is applicable to this acquisition. The small business size standard for this NAICS is 500 employees.</p>
<p>All questions regarding this RFI/Sources Sought must be submitted electronically&nbsp;to the below email addresses by Friday, 22 January 2016.</p>
<p>All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a capability statement response to this announcement. All such responses will be considered by the agency. Responses can be submitted electronically using the following address: stephen.cooper.15@us.af.mil and jared.dwyer.1@us.af.mil. All responses shall be received by Friday, 29 January 2016 at 1:00 PM Central Standard Time. Responses shall be no more than 20 pages (single spaced, front and back, no smaller than Times New Roman, font size 12 or equivalent). If submissions exceed the page count noted, the Government will only review the first 20 pages and disregard the remainder of the submission. Extraneous materials (brochures, manuals, etc.) will not be considered. Questions concerning this announcement shall be submitting in writing via email to both Contract Administrator, Stephen Cooper (stephen.cooper.15@us.af.mil) and Contracting Officer, Jared Dwyer (jared.dwyer.1@us.af.mil). The Government does not intend to rank submittals or provide any reply to firms as it relates to the Government's review of the data submitted in response to this announcement.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command (ACC) Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) Edgewood Contracting Division (ECD), on behalf of the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) intends to competitively solicit proposals for the Joint Enterprise - Contracted Logistics and Services Support (JE-CLaSS). The anticipated final Request for Proposal (RFP) seeks proposals for a Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (MA IDIQ) contract.  <br>  <br> Within the Department of Defense (DoD), JPEO-CBD has ongoing needs for Performance Based Logistics (PBL) sustainment and support services for the highly complex, low-density systems and equipment developed and fielded by the Joint Project Management(JPM) organizations chartered and operating within the JPEO-CBD.  Used by the military services within the DoD and by various Other Government Agencies (OGAs), these systems and items of equipment provide critical force protection against Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear High Yield Explosives (CBRNE) threats, world-wide.   The JPEO-CBD is the life-cycle manager for chemical and biological defense equipment and medical countermeasures. <br>  <br> The JE-CLaSS acquisition will be conducted on the basis of a partial small business set-aside with two (2) suites of contract awards. One suite will be an Unrestricted Suite (full and open) and the other will be a Restricted Suite (small business set-aside).  The final RFP for the JE-CLaSS will have only one (1) Evaluation Task in the Restricted Suite and one (1) Evaluation Task in the Unrestricted Suite. The Unrestricted Suite Evaluation Task is  quote mark Dismounted Reconnaissance Sets Kits and Outfits Contractor Logistics Support quote mark  and the Restricted Suite Evaluation Task is  quote mark Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Equipment quote mark . <br>  <br> The Government anticipates between four (4) to six (6) Unrestricted Suite awards and between five (5) to eight (8) Restricted Suite awards. The Government reserves the right to award more than the anticipated number of awards or fewer than the anticipated number of awards if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. <br>  <br> The JE-CLaSS effort will be solicited utilizing a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection process. It is estimated that solicitation W911SR-15-R-0002 will be issued for the JE-CLaSS effort within 30 days of this notice. <br>  <br> The point of contact for this effort is Ms. Mackenzie Ebling, Contract Specialist. All inquiries should be directed to mackenzie.t.ebling.civ@mail.mil. No telephonic inquiries will be accepted. <br>

<DESC><p>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Office of Acquisition Services (OAS), on behalf of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement to provide Health Program Support (HPS) services to the WTCHP, consistent with the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 (Zadroga Act). The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541990 -- All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.</p>
<p><br />The HPS contractor will continue all of the services currently being provided to the WTCHP to continue support for healthcare of the responders who participated in the rescue, recovery, and cleanup in the aftermath of the attack on the WTC on September 11, 2001. Since that time, the Department of Health and Human Services, the CDC, and NIOSH have been active in assessing the health impact of the WTC disaster.</p>
<p>On January 2, 2011, the President of the United States signed into law the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010. This requirement is for third party administrative services, provider network management, 24/7 nurse advice hotline, medical review, analytics and reporting to support the WTCHP. In supporting the WTCHP, the HPS contractor will also interact with Clinical Centers of Excellence (CCE), the Nationwide Provider Network (NPN), Data Centers (DC), and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (to reimburse authorized health care services). The Zadroga Act can be found at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ347/pdf/PLAW-111publ347.pdf.</p>
<p>As of May 2015, the WTCHP had approximately 72,000 members enrolled, including 64,000 responders and 8,000 survivors. The Program delivered monitoring or screening exams to an estimated 20,000 members, diagnostic services to approximately 18,000 members, and treatment services to approximately 21,000 sick or injured members between 5/1/14 and 4/30/15. The current statistics and reports can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/wtc/reports_portal.html.</p>

<p>The proposed action is intended to be awarded on a sole source basis to General Electric at CAGEs 07482 &amp; 99207.

Subcontracting opportunities do exist for this effort.</p>
<p>Letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified OEM. This is proposed to be a FAR 15 effort.</p>
<p>A letter RFP will be issued to satisfy this action. The attached list of NSNs is the items for this current action. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately.</p>
<p>Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by September 26, 2014 and should identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT BEST VIEWED/DOWNLOADED FROM FAA CONTRACT OPPORTUNITIES WEB SITE, HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV, KEYWORD: 16-R-05357.

AMENDMENT A005: Issued January 13, 2016 to add incremental pricing options to CLINs 0004 and 0005, as well as evaluation instructions in reference to incremental pricing.  In addition, the requirement for Past Performance information has been clarified to specify that projects submitted for past performance evaluation must have been completed within the last five (5) years.

The due date for receipt of proposals has been extended to January 28, 2016.

AMENDMENT A004: Issued January 8, 2016 to replace Attachment 1 with Attachment 1R to update the SOW, Attachment 9R is replaced by Attachment 9R(a) to provide completion instructions, and GFE clauses have been added to the SIR.

The due date for receipt of proposals has not been changed. 

AMENDMENT A003: Issued January 4, 2016 to replace Attachment 9 with Attachment 9R to correct the due date for receipt of Past Performance Questionnaires.

AMENDMENT A002: Issued December 23, 2015 to extend date for questions to January 6, 2016 and due date for proposals to January 21, 2016.

AMENDMENT A001: Issued December 11, 2015 to add Contract Line Items for data requirements.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of replacement driver amplifier substrate assemblies and output amplifier substrate assemblies; both subassemblies are used inside the primary power amplifier for the Mode Select Beacon System (Mode S). The Mode S Beacon System is a combined secondary surveillance radar (beacon) and ground-air-ground data link system.  Mode S provides positional information and minimizes interference.  Mode S provides the medium for a digital data link which can be used to exchange information between aircraft and various air traffic control functions and weather databases.

The primary power amplifier produces high power radio frequency (RF) pulses that are radiated in space through the antenna main directional beam (frequency of operation is 1030 MHz).  The Government requires form-fit-functional replacement subassemblies that contain modern and available RF components; e.g., the RF transistor(s); that can replace the legacy units. 

Westinghouse; now Northrop Grumman originally designed, developed, and manufactured the driver amplifier substrate assembly and output amplifier substrate assembly, which were procured by the FAA when the Mode S systems were initially fielded.  The available specifications or drawings are provided with this market survey. The subassemblies must adhere to the configuration baselines as defined in the Statement of Work.  

The requirement is for a one-time fixed-price contract, with a first article delivery of two (2) units of each subassembly and options to buy 50 production units of each subassembly. 
Your attention is directed to Sections L and M of SIR/RFO DTFAAC-16-R-05357 for instructions for preparation and submission of proposals.  The SIR includes a technical evaluation to allow the FAA to determine Best Value.  Offerors are required to provide Past Performance Surveys to customers/contractors who are familiar with the work ethic, standards, performance, and deliverables of the prime/general contractor demonstrated through previous or ongoing contracts of a similar nature  [Provision L.3(g)(2).]  Offerors will complete Page 1 and Page 2, Section A of the Past Performance Surveys and then provide the surveys to their customers, who will in turn complete and return the surveys directly to the Contracting Officer by the due date specified on the surveys.  Two (2) to five (5) Past Performance Surveys must be submitted directly to the Contracting Officer.  Surveys received after the established due date may not be evaluated.
This requirement is 100% set-aside for competition among Small Businesses.  The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 334511 Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing.  The business size standard for this NAICS is 750 employees.

ALL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PROJECT/SPECIFICATIONS MUST BE RECEIVED IN WRITING (CONNIE.M.HOUPT@FAA.GOV) NO LATER THAN 4:00 P.M. CST ON JANUARY 6, 2016, TO ALLOW FOR RESPONSES TO BE PROVIDED PRIOR TO DUE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS.

Contractors must be registered with the System for Award Management, www.sam.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (January 28, 2016).  Reference AMS Clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), if the offeror does not become registered in the SAM database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.

In addition, offerors must complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.

Proposals must be received electronically by the FAA Contracting Officer, connie.m.houpt@faagov, no later than 2:00 p.m. CST, January 28, 2016.  


Any responses received after 2:00 p.m. CST, January 28, 2016, may not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals, incorporated by reference in the solicitation.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.

Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more offerors at any time during the SIR process.

This SIR/RFO is not to be construed as a contract or a commitment of any kind.  The Government shall not be liable for payment of any costs attributed to the preparation and submission of proposals.

Inquiries regarding this SIR/RFO should be directed to the Contracting Officer, Connie Houpt, connie.m.houpt@faa.gov.

<DESC><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', serif; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt">Under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) is leading the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) Project to enable a world-class program in neutrino physics. Specifically, LBNF Project plans to build a new high-intensity neutrino beam at Fermilab aimed at large liquid argon-based neutrino detectors planned to be located at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, SD. In close coordination with LBNF, the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) Project will construct and install the neutrino detectors planned for SURF. In support of DUNE, the LBNF Project will construct Conventional Facilities (CF) on the surface and deep underground on the 4850-foot level at SURF.</span>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', serif; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt"><br />To construct LBNF facilities at SURF, Fermilab intends to procure Construction Manager/General Contractor (CM/GC) services through a competitive, best value procurement. The LBNF CM/GC work will be structured in distinct phases: Phase 1 (Base Scope) includes preconstruction construction management services; and Phase 2 (Optional Scopes) including construction management and execution of the construction of the CF at SURF (Option 1) and management only of the cryogenic infrastructure systems to be installed at SURF through separate contacts held by Fermilab and its partners (Option 2). </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', serif; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt">During Phase 1, the CM/GC will provide support services to LBNF and its existing architecture and engineering team including recommendations on selection of materials, building systems and equipment, construction feasibility, logistics management, value engineering, and factors related to construction, plus cost estimates and schedules, including estimates of alternative designs or materials. The CM/GC will also provide recommendations of actions designed to minimize adverse effects of labor or material shortages, time requirements for procurement and installation and construction completion. Design (facility and/or experiment) is not within the CM/GC scope.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', serif; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt">During Phase 2, the CM/GC will manage and execute underground excavation, excavated rock removal, all infrastructure and utilities to support the experiment such as power, communications and controls, HVAC, plumbing, and surface facilities to house cryogenic equipment and support DUNE. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', serif; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt">LBNF currently expects to complete preliminary CF designs in late 2015 and expects to begin final CF design work in the first half of 2016. Construction activities at SURF through the CM/GC contract are expected to begin by late 2017. CM/GC proposing firms / teams will need to demonstrate extensive experience in heavy civil underground construction using a CM/GC delivery method and have the capacity and experience to successfully deliver the LBNF CF at SURF with a high degree of safety.</span></p>

The purpose of this modification is to extend the closing date and to answer questions that was submitted.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR A&E IDIQ

1.	May we use ACASS reports or past PPQs in lieu of this form? 	 We will accept other proof of past performance ratings as long as it has the same requested information.

2.	We could not find or download the Geographic Location Choice(s) page shown in the Chart on page 60 of the Terms & Conditions. Please indicate where we can find.      , just include a statement in the cover page stating what areas you would like,	 however,  we would like for each of the four selected firms to be able to work any of the areas that are within the Region 4 area of responsibility or other states if necessary.
 
3.	Since the Disciplines Services Sheet is no longer required in Phase 1 of the selection process, do we submit any cost or pricing info at this time?	  No pricing is to be submitted until phase !! whereby directions will be sent out how to send the for to the contracting officer in a sealed envelope that will only be seen by the contracting officer after the board has selected the final four organizations/firms etc.

4.	Is there a date range for how recent the projects highlighted in Section F of the SF330 should be or is there not a limited time period? 	 We would like within the last five years but you may include any project as long as it does not go over the 60 page limit.
 
5.	Amendment 1: Regarding Attachment 2, the Contractor Performance Questionnaire (to be completed by client only, returned to USFWS), is there a preferred method of delivery for these (email from client, fax, or USPS/delivery)?		 Email from client to earl Higginbotham @  earl_higginbotham@fws.gov . 

6.	The files included in the amendment 1 download included a Microsoft Word document entitled Contractor Past Performance Questionnaire.  However, the solicitation itself makes no mention of this form being required as part of our statement of qualifications submittal.  Is this form required to be submitted on January 15th? 	 The contractor past performance evaluation is to be submitted no later than the closing date and time.

7.	The files included in the amendment 1 download included a Microsoft Word document entitled DISCIPLINE OR SERVICE (1).  This appears to be a wage rate disclosure form.  However, the solicitation itself makes no mention of this form being required as part of our statement of qualifications submittal.  Is this form required to be submitted on January 15th? 	 No only on phase II will the pricing be seen only by the contracting officer or the contracting officer administrative officer.  The 

8.	board will not see the pricing before their selection..

9.	If the wage rate disclosure form is to be submitted, will it be used in selecting the most qualified firms?	 	 No pricing is due for phase II evaluations.

10.	Under #2 of Evaluation Factors, "Past Performance on USFWS A/E IDIQ Contracts," what if we don't have experience with these yet? Will we lose points, if so how many? Or would we be disqualified?		  A contractor will not loose points for lack of FWS experience but would receive a neutral rating in this catergory, if applicable.
 
11.	Can you clarify what "Questionnaire #7 was added, submit as stated in solicitation" means on the last page of the solicitation?  		The is a Contactor Performance Questionnaire form  that is to be completed by the client and emailed to earl_higginbotham@fws.gov and victor_bowman@fws.gov.  
 

12.	Will the pricing information submitted by the short listed firms remained sealed during that phase and only opened by the Contracting Officer during contract negotiations?		 The pricing will be sent to Earl Higginbotham and will only be opened when the final organization/firm has been selected. 

13.	Is the entire SF 330 limited to 30 pages, including sections A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I and Part II?  	The page limit was increased to 60 pages total not including the cover page.  

14.	Will each printed side (contains content/text like diagrams, extraneous data, etc.) of the piece of paper count as 1 page?   	The normal page is 8  by 11   anything larger counts as two pages.  Printing on both sides of the 8  X 11  counts as two pages.

15.	Is a price volume required? 	 Pricing is only due in phase 2 and will be sent to the contracting officer who is the only one that can open and will not be revealed until the final organization/firm has been selected for a contract.  

16.	Other than the Discipline or Service information document attached to Modification 00001 (Amendment 1), what is required to be included in the price volume?   	Just this form for the initial year and four option years

17.	Sol F16PS00019 Amd  00001 references a portfolio. Is this in addition to the SF 330 volume? 		 The portfolio is referring to the entire packet containing the cover letter the sf330 and any other information that you submit, remembering that the page count is limited to 60 pages not counting the cover page.
 

18.	Under #2 of Evaluation Factors, "Past Performance on USFWS A/E IDIQ Contracts," what if we don't have experience with these yet? Will we lose points, if so how many?

<DESC>Food and Drug Administration<br />Request for Information <br />For ORA's Regulatory Business Information Services (RBIS) Requirements<br />Anticipated Contract Type: Single Award BPA
<p><br />Summary<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is issued in support of the anticipated acquisition of the Food and Drug Administration's procurement of services and technical resources to maintain and continue to enhance the Regulatory Business Information Services (RBIS) system. It is anticipated that this requirement will result in the award of a single award Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) and, based on the responses to this RFI, the FDA will be able to determine the appropriateness of small business participation.</p>
<p>Background<br />This RFI is for information, planning and market research purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration or its Centers. The purpose of this RFI is to help the FDA understand the industry best practices and technical solutions capable of providing the full range of services described in this RFI and draft SOW. FDA will use this market research information to assess the market's capability to successfully meet FDA's Dashboard toolset requirements. FDA welcomes responses from all interested parties. FDA does not intend to make a selection decision or award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or FDA's use of such information. Responses to this RFI are not quotes on which the FDA can issue any Schedule orders. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not itself constitute a Request for Quotations (RFQ). The Government does not intend to award a Schedule order(s) or BPAs based only on responses to this RFI. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the outcome of the FDA's review of the information received. Additionally, the FDA does not intend to hold discussions concerning this RFI with any interested parties. However, FDA reserves the right to contact vendors if additional information is required.</p>
<p>The FDA is requesting comments on the draft SOW from both large and small businesses. Comments from all sized firms are welcome. In addition, the purpose of this RFI is twofold: first, to determine the acquisition strategy regarding small business participation, and second, to obtain industry comments on the draft Statement of Work (SOW). Through this process, the FDA is requesting the capabilities and past performance of small business contractors interested in providing these services across the FDA. Interested small business contractors including Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned, 8(a)'s, HUBZones, Veteran-Owned, or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.</p>
<p>General Instructions<br />A complete response to the RFI should include answers to all of the questions below. Responses should demonstrate capability, not merely affirm the respondent's capability (e.g.: The response must go beyond the statement that, "XYZ company can provide a tool.").</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to submit comments and suggestions related to the draft Statement of Work. Please submit the response in Microsoft Word or PDF format. Information should not exceed fifteen (15) one sided 8 &frac12; x 11 pages, with one inch margins, and font no smaller than 12 point.</p>
<p>Responses should be emailed to Michele Andrews, Contract Specialist at Michele.Andrews@fda.hhs.gov no later than 9:00&nbsp;AM Eastern Time, January 19, 2016.</p>

<CONTACT>Jennifer White, Contract Specialist, Phone 9104513096, Email jennifer.l.white@usmc.mil
<DESC><p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br />RFQ M67001-16-Q-0040<br />Steam Plant Chemicals</p>
<p>QUESTION: 2 Technical Requirements. b). Sodium sulfite oxygen scavenger - are you requesting a dry or liquid based sulfite? If dry do you have mix tanks? You do want catalyzed sodium sulfite, correct?</p>
<p>ANSWER: We are requesting dry sulfite treatment. Yes, catalyzed sodium sulfite. We have batch tanks for mixing dry sulfite at the larger plants.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Section 2.1.9.4 Weekly. Are routine service visits at a weekly interval? *as an example per month: large steam plants week 1, small steam plants group A week 2, small steam plants group B week 3, hot water boilers (first 20) week 4 *hot water boilers would be checked monthly at 20 site intervals....month 1 - 20, month 2 - 20, month 3 - 20, month 4 - 20, month 5 - 20, month 6 - none (repeat for months 7 - 12 to get the loops checked twice annually)</p>
<p>ANSWER: Routine service visits are weekly for steam plant monitoring and treatment only. We would like our treatment inventory monitored and maintained so that we don't run out of treatment. The example above is good for routine visits. Our current contractor tests the steam supply and condensate return systems at least monthly. This has worked well for us.<br />We would expect the contractor to inform operations and the chemist of any plant related issues they might find. This may include visiting and testing one or more plants multiple times to help resolve any issues.</p>
<p>Hot water boiler monitoring by the contractor is not included in this contract. This contract covers chemical supply and test kits and reagents for hot water boiler systems.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Section 2.2 Equipment Requirements 2.2.2 - Should these tanks be double walled tanks (self-contained) and will they be located inside or outside?</p>
<p>ANSWER: We currently have both inside and outside tanks. Outside tanks are double walled except where they have secondary containment. Inside or outside tanks installed under this contract should be double walled. The Environmental Management Division MCBCL specifies storage tanks 50 gal. and above be double walled or have secondary containment.</p>
<p>QUESTION: 2.2.3 - How many chemical feed pumps will need to be replaced and are these to be included in the fixed price?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Currently there are no chemical feed pumps that need to be replaced. Price of pumps will be included in the fixed price.<br /><br />QUESTION: 2.2.4 - How many neat chemical feed tanks and pumps for future small plants will there be and are these to be included in the fixed price?</p>
<p>ANSWER: We have plans for 7 new steam plants to go online in the future. This should include 14 chemical tanks and 14 chemical pumps. These should be included in the fixed price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QUESTION: 2.2.5 - Is the heat tracing to be included in the fixed price and if so is there a specific scope / # locations / etc.?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Heat tracing will be included in the fixed price if required. We have been able in the past to place our treatments inside plants to avoid freezing. We don't have a specific scope or location where heat tracing may be required in the future.</p>
<p>QUESTION: (4) Service. h &amp; j state to provide 8 combined water test kits and 8 conductivity meters, but in 2.1.11 &amp; 2.1.13 it states to provide 6 of each?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Please provide 6 combined test kits and 6 conductivity meters.</p>
<p>QUESTION: (5) Equipment. Do the tanks have to be stainless?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Tanks do not need to be stainless unless required for storage of treatment or required for chemical feed.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Install stainless chemical feed piping, valves and gauges for bulk neat feed. In section 2.2 Equipment Requirements it states **The Government will install and maintain feed lines pertaining to all chemical pumps included in this contract**. Just some clarification on whose responsibility this will be?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Feed lines will be the responsibility of the government.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Do you know if liquid for powdered sulfite is required? The other chemicals are all liquid as the unit of measure is gallons, but the sulfite unit of measure is pounds. The problem is that sometimes liquids are priced in pounds also.</p>
<p>ANSWER: Solid sulfite.</p>

This award was necessary for the continuance of <span style="COLOR: black; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin">contractor support services to the Special Communication Mission Support Division in the areas of C4SIR operational systems development including systems assessments and design, systems acquisition and program planning, integrated project management and strategy and analytics services for diverse hardware related projects in different development stages. </span>The bridge contract was needed for continuing ongoing support previously done under BAH Task Order, N00178-04-D-4024-M802 while the follow-on contract is being completed with an estimated award date in August 2017. Due to the ongoing nature of the support services currently being performed under Task Order N00178-04-D-4024-M802 and the need to continue these services with a minimal break in work, BAH was the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a competitive follow-on contract. The Government will not pay for any information received.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No telephone responses will be accepted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any questions shall be submitted to Tiffany Crayle, Code 2.5.1.3.19, Telephone (301) 757-1534, or via email: tiffany.crayle@navy.mil.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: VA69D-16-AP-1405	1A. PROJECT/TASK No. 607-16-1-114-0008	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: $72,130.00
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE: Remove the Philips Allura System, MDL XPER FD10, Serial Number 01446, EE 21304, from its current location in room C4156 and prepare the equipment for storage until remodel completion. The equipment will then be re-located, installed and re-calibrated in room C4159 of the Madison VA Hospital.




3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED: The Philips equipment is currently being serviced under task order VA69D-14-J-4739 that is not due to expire until 9/30/2016. This contract covers normal service, emergency service, repair and preventive maintenance. 



4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
Bringing in another vendor to move the equipment could result in a voided warranty or violation of propriety software. This particular requirement does not cover equipment issues should service be needed upon movement or set up. Philips is the current incumbent and the only vendor able to service the equipment. 



5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED: Market research was not conducted. Current contract coverage on this equipment is already being performed by Philips. No other vendor is available to make a needed repair or service in case of problems during moving and storage. Furthermore, no other company can re-calibrate and set up the machines upon completion of the move.



6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
