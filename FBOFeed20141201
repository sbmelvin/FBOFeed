<p>Manufacturer's Code and Part Number:<br />MEGGITT (NORTH HOLLYWOOD), INC. (79318), P/N 27131244</p>
<p>Unit of Issue: EA</p>
<p>Quantity: 42</p>
<p>Various Increments Solicited: 1-28, 29-42, 43-65, 66-94</p>
<p>Destination Information: FOB Origin, Inspection and Acceptance at Destination</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: 238 days</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered.</p>
<p>The solicitation (RFP) will be available in DIBBS on its issue date of 12/16/14 at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP/. Solicitation number is SPE7MC15R0028.</p>
<p>The Small Business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>TYPE OF SET-ASIDE: unrestricted</p>
<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, past performance, delivery and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>

<DESC>Healthy Communities Study (HCS)<br /><br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is planning to negotiate and award additional funds to a current contract, without providing for full and open competition, to Battelle Memorial Institute under Contract HHSN268201000041C. The purpose of this announcement is to provide a Presolicitation Notice as a synopsis for award. The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541712 with a Size Standard of 500 employees. THIS IS A SYNOPSIS. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  Proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be posted to FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Healthy Communities Study, being conducted since August of 2010, assesses the associations between characteristics of community programs/policies and BMI, diet, and physical activity in elementary and middle school children, including communities that have a high proportion of African American, Latino, and/or low income residents. In addition to cross-sectional data, the HCS includes retrospective data on both BMI and community programs and policies. The retrospective BMI data is critical because the HCS will be able to assess longitudinal associations between BMI and childhood obesity programs and policies as these programs unfolded within communities over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>The analyses, publication, and presentation of the longitudinal data will require additional funding because of the complex relationships between children's BMI trajectories and community programs and policies over time. Without the additional funding, the study cannot complete analyses of the longitudinal medical record and community data.</p>
<p>The objective of this work is to clean and analyze longitudinal all of the community programs and policies and BMI data (from medical record abstraction) and develop a manuscript for publication and presentation.</p>
<p>Specific work being conducted:</p>
<p>1. Clean the longitudinal BMI data obtained from the medical records,<br />2. Conduct analyses to assess the relationships between the longitudinal community program and policy data and the longitudinal BMI data,<br />3. Develop a manuscript for publication based upon the longitudinal data, and<br />4. Present the findings from the longitudinal analyses at an obesity-related conference.</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All responses must be received by Tuesday, December 16, 2014 at 3:00 pm eastern time and must reference number NHLBI-HV-2015-12-JB. Responses shall be submitted electronically to Justin Borden, Contract Specialist, at justin.borden@nih.gov.  Fax responses will not be accepted.</p>

<a href="mailto:matthew.c.wilson@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Huntington</a>
<DESC>The project consists of the installation of a potable waterline in the East Fork Recreation area of East Lynn Lake, East Lynn, WV. The line begins at a water meter along WV State Route 37 and extends to the existing water treatment plant in the East Fork Campground.  The waterline is approximately 4 miles in length and changes between 3-inch HDPE and 2-inch HDPE.  The waterline follows the road bed of old route 37 from its beginning until it crosses East Lynn Lake at the East Fork causeway.  From this point, the line is generally located in the shoulder of the Campground Access Road until it reaches the campground, where it meanders around campsites and existing facilities.  From the campground, the waterline runs uphill to the existing water plant where it discharges through a control valve to the existing water storage tank.  This construction contract will consist of a base contract with 1 option.  The base contract installs the line up to the first use point, the Day Use Area Comfort Station. Option 1 begins at the end of the base contract and extends all the way to the discharge point at the water storage tank.  The contract will be awarded to the responsive and responsible bidder with the lowest balanced price. This work will be further detailed in the technical specifications and the contract drawings.

<DESC>Federal Business Opportunities Information <br>  <br> This solicitation is Small Business Set-Aside. <br>  <br> The Pueblo Chemical Depot is a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) installation and therefore, this solicitation will be issued in accordance with the requirements of the Defense BRAC law of 1988 which requires that preference shall be given to local and small businesses. Businesses located in the vicinity of a military installation that is being closed or realigned under a base closure law, including 10 U.S.C. 2687, and small and small disadvantaged businesses shall be provided maximum practicable opportunity to participate in acquisitions that support the closure or realignment, including acquisitions for environmental restoration and mitigation. This will be in accordance with DFARS 226.71.  <br>  <br> On or about July 3, 2014, this office will issue a Request for Proposal for a small business set-aside (BRAC) $70M, Firm-Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for Performance Based Environmental Remediation with Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP) and Hazardous Toxic, Munitions and Explosives of Concern (MEC) and Radiological Waste (HTRW) at multiple sites at Pueblo Chemical Depot, Pueblo County, Colorado.  The solicitation will close on or about August 5, 2014.  <br>  <br> Project Description: <br>  <br> This Site Specific Performance Based Remediation Contract will be for qualified, experienced sources located within Pueblo County Colorado or Adjacent Counties capable of performing environmental remediation services with MMRP and HTRW at multiple sites at the Pueblo Chemical Depot (PCD), Pueblo County, Colorado.  This acquisition shall include various sites at the Pueblo Chemical Depot, Pueblo Colorado.   <br>  <br> The Base Realignment and Closure Environmental Restoration Programs requires services of contractors with technical staff, equipment, and facilities to execute investigation and cleanup conducted at Installation Restoration, Munitions Response, and Compliance Cleanup sites on Army BRAC installations.  Investigation and cleanup conducted under the proposed contract meet the Army legal requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Response Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  <br>  <br> The Omaha District plans to continue environmental remediation measures at the Pueblo Chemical Depot (PCD), Pueblo County, Colorado.  All PCD missions except the storage of chemical munitions were terminated in September 1994.  PCD's current mission is the safe and secure storage, monitoring, and destruction of the chemical stockpile; and preparation for Depot closure.  The Contractor will not be responsible for chemical munitions disposal activities or subsequent environmental remediation related to chemical weapons demilitarization activities, as part of this contract.  <br>  <br> There will be a full range of remediation activities required across the installation for all PCD sites to include contamination that has migrated beyond boundaries. The site includes Installation Restoration Program (IRP) sites and Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP) sites. Services may include, but are not limited to, the control of environmental contamination from pollutants, toxic substances, and hazardous materials. The Contractor must have the capability and experience to perform, or provide, a wide range of engineering, remedial design, remedial construction, and remediation services required for hazardous substance and waste sites.  In addition to advancing the closure of many sites through the RCRA process, this contract will address the regulatory closure requirements of the two (2) plumes of contamination that have migrated offsite.  Work will include investigation, evaluation of remedial alternatives, remedial design, remedial construction, remediation of contaminated sites, remedial action (operations) (RA(O)), and long-term management.

These services predominately require performance or approval by registered and/or licensed A&amp;E professionals, either as individual organizations, partnerships, joint ventures or other legal entities permitted by law to practice architecture or engineering.</p>
<p>USAID anticipates that the maximum ordering of the contracts resulting from this RFQ will be $600,000,000 over the 5-year ordering period.  The maximum aggregate dollar value of task orders awarded to all contractors cannot exceed this contract ceiling.  This ceiling is not being subdivided among the number of awardees, nor is it being multiplied by the number of awardees.  There is no guarantee on the number of task orders that the successful contractors will receive or the amount of money beyond the minimum order of guarantee set forth in the RFQ.  <br /> <br />These awards will replace the current A&amp;E IDIQ contracts which were awarded in September 2008 and will expire in September 2015.  The contractors performing under this mechanism are:</p>
<p>&bull;	EDH-I-00-08-00023-00 CDM International, Inc. <br />&bull;	EDH-I-00-08-00024-00 Metcalf &amp; Eddy <br />&bull;	EDH-I-00-08-00025-00 MWH Americas, Inc. <br />&bull;	EDH-I-00-08-00026-00 Parsons Global Services, Inc. <br />&bull;	EDH-I-00-08-00027-00 Tetra Tech Inc.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541310.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (www.fedbizopps.gov) not less than 15 days after this notice is issued.  In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only.  Requests for other copies of the solicitation will be disregarded without notice to the requestor.  No phone requests will be accepted, copies of the solicitation will not be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed.  Offerors are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement.  Telephonic requests or inquiries will not be taken.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate USAID to release a solicitation or award a contract nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal.  In addition, final award cannot be made until funds have been fully appropriated, allocated, and committed and internal USAID procedures have been completed.  This notice satisfies the synopsis requirement in FAR 5.201.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 10.3999996185303px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Place of Performance</span></span></p>

<DESC>Scope of Work: <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PMFSS) is conducting market research regarding industry's interest and capability in providing up to 250 Expeditionary Solid Waste Disposal Systems (ESWDS). This is not a request for proposal. This notice is only to request information, which may assist the Government in developing future procurement strategies. The ESWDS will improve soldier health and the environment by replacing burn pits by providing a relatively simple, sustainable waste disposal means. The ESWDS shall consist of an incinerator and ancillary equipment integrated and packaged for turn-key use in harsh military applications. The detailed requirements will be in the form of a performance-based specification rather than detailed drawings and specifications. Ahead of production will be a design and development phase during which a vendor or vendors would design and build an ESWDS for qualification testing. Much of the design may include modifying or enhancing a commercial item to create a rugged, expeditionary system suitable for military use, and a system that meets all of the performance requirements below. There are also logistics support requirements associated with ESWDS, including development of military technical manuals and training courses and DVDs.   <br>  <br> Key ESWDS Performance Requirements: <br>  <br> *Shall facilitate manual batch loading and timed incineration cycles. <br> *Shall incinerate up to 1000 pounds per day of mixed, non-hazardous solid waste.  <br> *At least 90 percent volume reduction shall be accomplished for each batch. <br> *Furnish compaction or other devices to minimize the number of batches needed to burn 1000 pounds per day. <br> *Shall include a secondary control burn chamber.  The detention time and control temperatures of the secondary burn chamber shall provide the best pollution control attainable within the allowable footprint and fuel use limitations of ESWDS.  <br> *When transported to or from the expeditionary site, the entire ESWDS, including its refuse chamber, secondary control chamber, controls, stack, and compactors, shall fit within the footprint of no more than the equivalent of one ISO container of 8'x8'x20'L (e.g., may also use two 10-foot long containers or three 6.6-foot long containers).  Skid mounted systems fitting within this size footprint may be considered if they meet all other requirements herein. . <br> *The largest material handling equipment available to move and set up the system is a forklift with 10k pounds capacity, and a crane will not be available to set stack.  No single container or skid shall weigh more than 10k pounds.   <br> *Fuel supplied will be JP-8 and fuel resupply will be limited to no more than 500 gallons per week.  <br> *Available electric power at a contingency basecamp is either 120-volt single phase, 208-volt single phase or 208-volt three phase.  Cables shall be provided to connect ESWDS to the power supply. <br> *Shall be easy to set up, operate, and maintain by soldiers with non-technical skills whose solid waste disposal duties are not a primary responsibility but rather an extra and shared chore. <br> *Shall be suitable for use in Army contingency operations such as war time.  ESWDS is not for routine use in the U.S., except minimal operation time for system testing and operation and maintenance training. <br> *The ESWDS will not be placed in a separately furnished shelter.  Rather the ESWDS shall provide adequate shelter or enclosures for its components and its operators.  ESWDS shall work in extremely cold environments of -25F; extremely hot environments of135F; hot/humid environments; dusty and windy environments; and otherwise inclement weather.   <br> *Shall be durable to withstand transport by air, sea, rail, and ground.  Shall remain functional after being subjected to rail impact testing and extensive military road shock testing. <br>  <br> Other requirements: <br>  <br> *Technical publications and manuals shall be developed for operation and maintenance of the ESWDS in accordance with MIL-STD-40051-2B. <br> *Training courses and instructional DVDs shall be developed for operation and maintenance of the ESWDS. <br> *Engineer and design the ESWDS to meet performance specifications and implement configuration control. <br>  <br> Information of interest: <br>  <br> PMFSS appreciates vendors' interest in this notice.  For those sources interested in responding, the information is required within 45 calendar days from the publication date of this notice. PMFSS understands some sources may not have all capabilities and experience sought in the notice, and welcomes responses that do not address all items.  The following information is requested: 1) Information on existing commercial incinerators that potentially meet the above performance requirements; and how they currently match up against each performance requirement; 2) willingness of the vendor to modify existing systems to meet the above requirements; 3) description of any products that demonstrate the vendor's interest in and capability of integration and containerization of systems; 4) experience designing systems to meet performance specifications and configuration control; 5) experience developing technical manuals and training courses for vendors' products; 6) existing quality assurance program; 7) description of current manufacturing capacity and capability; 8) Vendor's NAICS Code and whether or not vendor is a small business (include number of employees); and 9) recent unit prices of the products presented in the vendor's response. Information shall be limited to fifteen (15) pages or less with no smaller than font size ten (10). If provided electronically, the response needs to be in Microsoft Word 2003, Microsoft Word 2007 or Adobe Acrobat 9 compatible format. Electronic responses to this notice are requested to be emailed to jeffrey.d.wallace18.civ@mail.mil no later 5:00PM on 45 calendar days from the posting date of this notice. Any questions regarding this notice may be sent to this email as well. The subject line of any emails should include the words  quote mark ESWDS Sources Sought Notice. quote mark    <br>  <br> Any information provided is based on the best information available at the time of the response; is subject to revision; and is not binding upon the Government or respondent. Any formal solicitation or request for proposal would be announced later under a separate Federal Business Opportunities announcement. All information received in response to this notice that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses may not include classified material. No reimbursement will be made for any costs to provide information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.

<p>The Truckee River Bridge Project proposes improvements to resolve the existing, deteriorated condition of the Truckee River Bridge (locally known as "Fanny Bridge") and the existing traffic congestion at the wye intersection of State Route (SR) 28 and 89, located in Tahoe City, Placer County, California. The project site extends approximately 1.15 miles on SR 28 and 0.8 mile on SR 89. The proposed improvements are designed to enhance motorized and non-motorized mobility, reduce traffic congestion, accommodate anticipated future increases in traffic, increase access across the Truckee River, address existing pedestrian and traffic safety concerns, and encourage revitalization of the local Tahoe City community.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">Under one of the Alternatives being evaluated, SR 89 would be realigned as a new two-lane segment of highway that would cross through USFS's 64-Acre Tract. The western end of the new segment would begin at a new single-lane roundabout, which would serve as the new SR 89/SR 28 intersection. A new bridge over the Truckee River would be constructed immediately to the southeast of the roundabout on the new roadway segment. The new alignment would continue east and reconnect to existing SR 89 at a single-lane roundabout near the existing changeable message sign and sled hill. Realignment of SR 89 and construction of the new bridge would include modifications to the existing Caltrans maintenance facility, construction of retaining walls, realignment of an existing sewer main line, and realignment of existing bike paths. </span></p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fanny Bridge would be rehabilitated or replaced to address the existing structural deficiencies and resolve safety and community concerns. Traffic calming and aesthetic features would be installed within this section of roadway (e.g., reduced speed limit, bulb-outs, landscaped areas, raised landscaped median, on-street parking, sidewalks, street lighting, benches, etc.). New parking or landscaping may replace the existing free-right turns.</p>

<p>10. DESCRIPTION<br />This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>
<p>a. Background: <br />Federal Occupational Health (FOH) is a non-appropriated agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) that provides occupational health and wellness services exclusively to federal employees. FOH works in partnership with federal organizations nationally and internationally to design and deliver comprehensive solutions to meet their occupational health needs.</p>
<p>FOH is the largest provider of occupational health services in the federal government, serving more than 360 federal agencies and reaching 1.8 million federal employees. Created in 1946 by an amendment to the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.), FOH has more than sixty-seven years of experience providing services exclusively to Federal agencies.</p>
<p>In 1984, FOH became fully reimbursable, operating free of congressional appropriations. This means that FOH operates like a business within the government and charges fellow government agencies for the services it provides them.</p>
<p>Over the years, FOH has created numerous programs to: <br />&bull; Improve the health and fitness of Federal employees <br />&bull; Prevent and reduce workplace illnesses and injuries <br />&bull; Improve employee/employer relationships <br />&bull; Decrease absenteeism and employee turnover <br />&bull; Decrease costs associated with workers' compensation claims <br />&bull; Help agencies comply with OSHA regulatory requirements <br />Clinical health services, including emergency response; physical exams; immunizations; vision and health screenings; and health risk appraisals are available at FOH's 298 Health and Wellness Centers located in federal buildings throughout the United States and through a large network of more than 15,000 private-provider physicians and nurses.</p>
<p>FOH provides Wellness and Health Promotion (WHP) services to federal agencies nationwide. FOH WHP services provide numerous benefits that improve organizational effectiveness such as reduced absenteeism and healthcare costs; greater job satisfaction; and improved morale.</p>
<p>FOH's behavioral health services are provided by staff counselors located in 75 counseling offices in federal buildings as well as through a vast network of affiliate counselors in approximately 17,000 locations across the country and overseas.</p>
<p>FOH's Environmental Health and Safety program helps agencies identify and resolve environmental health issues by addressing them early through assessments, abatement programs, and on-going monitoring, as well as specialized training for employees and managers.</p>
<p>Other services and products, including administrative operations, health resources, information technology support, financial management, and strategic acquisitions are available through the Program Support Center (PSC), a shared services organization dedicated to helping its customers achieve mission-critical results.</p>
<p>b. Purpose <br />One of the services that FOH provides to federal agencies and their employees is FOH's tobacco cessation program. Current annual voluntary participation in this program is approximately 1,000 to 1,500 clients. The goal of the tobacco cessation program is to provide clients with education and counseling, combined with the most appropriate nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (patch, gum or lozenge) in an attempt to eliminate this addiction. FOH staff manages and implements the program, including interviews and training for the clients. This purpose of this acquisition is to procure the nicotine replacement products, the delivery of the product directly to the clients, and training and tools for the FOH staff. The contractor must meet all specifications and provide all deliverables as outlined in this Statement of Work.</p>
<p>c. Performance Objective<br />The following outlines the sequence of events for an interested individual to enroll in FOH's smoking cessation program. FOH must have an interagency agreement in place with the employee's agency in order to enroll. Given the signed agreement and agency funding, the following events occur:</p>
<p>&bull; The client submits an eligibility form to FOH to sign up for the program, including relevant contact information</p>
<p>&bull; An FOH trained staff member initiates and conducts a counseling session with the federal employee to determine:<br />o Appropriateness of NRT for use with federal employees<br />o Specific type and dosage of NRT that may be most efficacious<br />o Information regarding where to send NRT is recorded<br />o A "quit plan" is developed collaboratively</p>
<p>&bull; FOH staff order the appropriate NRT product (patch, gum or lozenge) and dosage from the contractor, which allows NRT product to be shipped directly to a participant's residence.</p>
<p>&bull; The contractor must provide a variety of flavors for the lozenge and the gum.</p>
<p>&bull; The contractor ships the designated NRT, along with a smoking cessation guide, to the individual recipient's home or work address. The orders must be traceable and received by the client within five (5) business days.</p>
<p>&bull; FOH staff follows up with the client approximately 2 weeks after their quit date to check on their status and determine if there are any side effects from the NRT. If the agency is paying for more than 4 weeks of NRT the second shipment is ordered.</p>
<p>&bull; FOH emails an online 6-Month Follow-up Survey to the client to determine the program's success.</p>
<p>The objective of this acquisition is to procure the NRT product (patch, gum or lozenges) that can be shipped directly to the client in shipments of either 2-week or 4-week supply increments.</p>
<p>Below, specific requirements are outlined to satisfy the above listed objectives.</p>
<p>d. Product Type, Storage and Supply<br />The contractor will maintain sufficient supply of the NRT products to ensure that products will not be backordered throughout the duration of this BPA. The NRT products must include:<br />Gum - variety of flavors offered in 2 mg and 4 mg<br />Patch - offered in 7mg, 14mg and 21mg<br />Lozenge - variety of flavors offered in 2 mg and 4 mg<br />The cost of storage for supplies shall be borne by the contractor. The product must be delivered to the client's home or work address within 5 business days. The product quantity must be available to be ordered and shipped out to the FOH client in quantities of 2-week and 4-week supplies.</p>
<p>e. Training<br />The contractor will provide interviewer training to individuals designated by FOH to<br />perform this function. Training will occur within two (2) weeks of notification to the<br />contractor by FOH. The contractor will perform the interviewer training as a part of their<br />product dissemination program. The contractor will provide an experienced trainer in <br />the area of tobacco cessation. The contractor must demonstrate that training protocols <br />are clinically based, and there is a demonstrated record of positive outcomes.</p>
<p>The contractor will provide FOH staff with training on placing orders as a part of <br />their product dissemination program.</p>
<p>f. Client Confidentiality<br />The contractor will insure that client data is managed in a manner that supports HIPAA Security and privacy standards. There must be a system in place to preserve the privacy of the individual client. Only personnel having a "need to know" should have access to client information.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, all financial, statistical, personal and/or technical data furnished, produced, or otherwise available to the contractor during performance on Calls placed against this BPA, are considered confidential. The information must not be used for purposes other than performance of work under Calls placed against this BPA, nor released to anyone by the contractor without prior written consent of FOH. Any presentation of statistical or analytical materials, or reports based on information obtained from any work covered by Calls placed against this BPA, will be subject to review by the Government before publication or dissemination.</p>
<p>All client data is considered to be government property and will be given to the Government at expiration of this BPA in a format that is usable by FOH or the follow-on contractor, if applicable.</p>
<p>g. Product Promotion and Employee Education</p>
<p>The contractor will partner with FOH for a minimum of five (5) health promotion events per year, such as health fairs or other outreach programs, to promote the tobacco cessation program and use of NRT.</p>
<p>The contractor will provide marketing and promotional materials that FOH can disseminate or reproduce on websites. Promotional materials might include a health risk assessment that would allow individuals to learn about the benefits of quitting, as well as the physical, emotional and psychological stress that tobacco use and smoking may cause. Other promotional materials could include pamphlets, etc.</p>

<DESC>Summary:<br />U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in December.
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>The Open Period for December is December 1, 2014 to December 7, 2014, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through FY 2015 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2014, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2015 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.   ** You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP.  Your previous offered space will not be copied.<br /> <br />OCCUPANCY: Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.<br /> <br />DELINEATED AREA:  All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the listed RLP must be located within the following boundaries:  Properties located in Pierce, King and Snohomish counties)</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.<br /> <br />LEASE TERM:  Up to 10 years.</p>

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of research support in the area of applied statistical analysis, experimental design and reliability modeling for the Department of Defense Test and Evaluation Enterprise. Specifically, the research support requires conducting research into the best practices and improved methods for testing and estimating system reliability growth, specifically addressing efficient test design strategies that account for cost and reliability growth. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology). Business size standard is for NAICS 541712 is 500 Employees.</p>
<p>The proposed source is the University of Arkansas. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by 8:00 am Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Monday, 8 December 14. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The DOD is incorporating Designs of Experiments (DOE) into its test enterprise, where testing is a critical aspect of any DOD systems acquisition. However, the adoption of these methods is relatively new and many of the DOD test organizations are just beginning to appreciate the benefits. Drs. Edward Pohl and Kelly Sullivan are both faculty members at the University of Arkansas, and are both leading authorities in the area of reliability modeling and reliability growth. Dr. Pohl is a leader in the Reliability and Maintainability research world quite often the only choice for tutorials at their national conference. Dr. Sullivan is a leading research in the field and close collaborator with Dr. Pohl. Drs. Pohl and Sullivan are the only source that will satisfy agency requirements in the case of a continuation of a multi-year line of research.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to Kelli.Vaughn@us.af.mil no later than 8:00 am Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Monday, 8 December 14. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered.</p>

This proposed action is for the procurement of research support in the area of applied statistical analysis, experimental design and reliability modeling for the Department of Defense Test and Evaluation Enterprise. Specifically, the research support requires examining ways to depict the functional response surface, from a na&iuml;ve approach to more sophisticated methods, determining improved sampling methods required to efficiently and effectively collect the functional response data, developing methods to combine experimental design techniques with time series modeling techniques, developing theory and methods for handling the multivariate correlation and autocorrelation present in such functional response data.

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command-Fort Hood (MICC-FH) intends to award a sole source Cost reimbursement type contract pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (C) (1), as implemented by 6.302-1 (Only one Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Needs), to the Center For Agile Technology, The University of Texas at Austin (CAT UT), Austin, Texas, 78727, for continuing to support the Extensible Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence Suite (ExCIS) software maintenance and development.  The CAT UT will provide hardware and software maintenance and development for the ExCIS Fire Support Application (FSA) in support of United States Army Operational Test Commands (USAOTCs) operational testing requirements.  The ExCIS FSA software is the instrumentation package used to simulate and stimulate current and future U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps field artillery (FA) and fire support (FS) systems using the legacy Field Artillery Tactical Data Systems (FATDS) and Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS) devices.  The CAT UT is the sole developer and producer of the ExCIS FSA software and is the only known company capable of fulfilling the ExCIS FSA requirements.  To award to any other source would most likely result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The Period of Performance is a Base year plus four one-year options. The NAICS code is 541511 with a size standard of $25.5 million. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which shall be considered by the agency, directly to the Contract Specialist, Mark Ramey, at mark.a.ramey10.civ@mail.mil, and the Contracting Officer, Belinda Woods, belinda.woods.civ@mail.mil, no later than 11:00 AM CST 16 December 2014.

<DESC>Notice Information <br />Solicitation: <br />NWCC-Master Stations <br />Agency/Office: <br />Natural Resources Conservation Service <br />Location: <br />National Centers Servicing Unit <br />Title: <br />Mt. Gilead <br />Contract Award Date: 01/01/2015<br />Description(s):
<p>This notice is being published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5.101 requiring the dissemination of information for proposed contract actions. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) intends to issue a sole source, firm-fixed-price contract to Michael Edwin Jordan for a small portion land lease to house the Mt. Gilead Master Station in Delaware,Ohio. National Water and Climate Center (NWCC) operates these Master Stations to accept and relay weather data from around the United States. The National Water and Climate Center (NWCC) collects data from multiple Meteorburst master stations in order to obtain remote station data from SNOTEL and SCAN systems. These projects range from helping to monitor and predict the snowmelt runoff and required reservoir storage to crop water uses.</p>
<p>The Mt Gilead master station is a receive site collecting data from weather stations within the surrounding nine hundred miles. Located in farming community with minimum RF and electrical interference, the land is flat and clear making it an ideal location for a meteorburst master station. The site consists of an air conditioned stick built building approximately ten feet by fifteen feet mounted on a concrete foundation and houses the two six hundred pound transmitters as well as a rack of equipment including the receivers, computers, and station controller and a work bench. The building also includes an annex on the front for equipment storage. The building is totally screened inside with copper screening designed to reject RF interference. Outside the site consists of nine forty foot antenna towers, one holding the dual crossed dipole transmit antenna and the other eight mount the thirty foot yagi receive antennas. The tower bases are sunk in four foot square by 6 foot deep concrete foundations. The heliax antenna cables are run in two inch conduit from each antenna tower to the shelter.</p>
<p>These stations are permanent and cannot easily be relocated and have been at the same location for years and it is the agency's intent to sign a one year contract with 4 option years. There is no reasonable expectation that the agency could relocate this station without excessive cost to the government therefore our intent is to sole source this contract.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to provide the requested items/services or an exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by Wednesday, December 17th, 2014at 11:00 a.m., local time, Fort Worth, Texas (Central Time). Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish your capability to fulfill the requirement. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. NRCS will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this notice.</p>
<p>Please email Darin Wilson at george.wilson@ftw.usda.gov with responses or questions regarding this requirement. This notice will close on December 17th, 2014 at 11:00 a.m. Central Time.</p>

<DESC>This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, but merely notification of the Social Security Administration's (SSA) intent to issue, on a sole-source basis, a firm fixed price purchase order to American Psychiatric Association for access to their online subscription entitled "PsychiatryOnline Premium". Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, the Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. PsychiatryOnline Premium is only available from its producer and manufacturer and not through dealers or distributors. The period of performance will be for twelve months, beginning January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. Library users will access the subscription via the Web through SSA's Digital Library, which resides behind the Agency's firewall and is password protected. Disability Determination Services (DDS) and the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR) Hearing Office staff will use this item to assist them in completing disability determinations and adjudicate disability claims related to mental impairments. This item is critical to reducing the disability case backlog. 
The subscription includes the following databases: ? DSM-5TM ? DSM-5TM Handbook of Differential Diagnosis ? DSM-5TM Casebook and its Treatment Companion ? The complete DSM archives (DSM-I, DSM-II, DSM-III, DSM-III-R, DSM-IV) ? 12 textbooks on a range of psychiatry topics ? Four peer-reviewed journals published by APA (access includes 1997-Present)

This requirement is utilizing procedures in FAR Part 12 in conjunction with procedures in FAR Part 13. A determination by SSA not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of SSA. Information received will be considered for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The government does not intend to pay for information provided in response to this notice. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. Responses should be submitted by 12:00PM ET on December 4, 2014. If SSA does not receive an acceptable response to this announcement by December 8, 2014, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with American Psychiatric Association as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted. Respondents should refer to 0919-15-1008. All responses must be submitted via email to Jameka.Anderson@ssa.gov.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to contract using other than full and open competition for its Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) for Operating and Computing Environment (OCE) for the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA). Accordingly, the TSA intends to award a 9 month interim bridge contract to InfoZen, Inc., located at 6700 A Rockledge Drive, Suite 300, Bethesda, MD.
<p>This new interim bridge contract will allow for the continuation of services and will continue to address the requirements of the OIA for the deployment, implementation, operation, and maintenance of a broad range of transportation vetting programs designed to protect the U.S. Transportation system against terrorism and threats to National Security. In general, vetting is described as the thorough examination or investigation of the behaviors, connections, sympathies, associations, and conveyances of persons, goods, things, and entities to identify explicit and implicit associations for suitability and reliability for a particular activity that requires a high degree of trust or loyalty.</p>
<p>This interim bridge contract will also continue to provide continuous, uninterrupted service of manufacturer hardware and software renewal maintenance support for the OIA Operations and Maintenance of the Operating and Computing Environment (OIA/OCE) at TSA HQ, Colorado Springs, CO and Annapolis Junction, MD.</p>

POC: ryan.d.hoover.mil@mail.mil <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [X] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [X] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

<DESC>The Enterprise Business Solutions (EBS) organization within the Department of Treasury's Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) has identified a requirement to renew its licenses for Virto software, which enhances the functionality of Microsoft SharePoint 2010. Virto software adds capabilities to the Enterprise Content Management (ECM) SharePoint platform. These capabilities include enhanced calendar integration and improved bulk file operations.
<p>The ECM program offers SharePoint, a web application framework and platform developed by Microsoft, as a shared-service offering. SharePoint offers basic functionality for the calendar view and manipulating files; however, these capabilities face limitations. The ECM program has integrated add-on software to augment these capabilities and address specific limitations. The Virto Calendar enables further integration of Microsoft Exhange calendar(s) with a single SharePoint calendar. The software also allows for more flexibility in customizing the calendar interface. The Virto Bulk Files Operations Toolkit enables users to upload and download multiple files to and from SharePoint. The software also facilitates the use of .zip files during these processes. This added functionality can save users time and allow for greater ease-of-use.</p>

<p>Who may be considered U.S. citizens or legal, permanent residents with five years of residency history</p>
<p>Duty location Washington, D.C., US<br />Note: more than one position may be filled under this announcement</p>
<p>Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a United States government-owned corporation created in 2004, whose mission is to provide assistance that will support economic growth and poverty reduction in carefully selected developing countries that demonstrate a commitment to just and democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry. To receive assistance, eligible countries are required to enter into a public agreement (Compact) with the MCC that includes a multi-year plan for achieving shared development objectives and the responsibilities of each country in achieving those objectives, regular benchmarks to measure progress, multi-year financial plan, and a plan to ensure accountability for the use of MCA assistance.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF POSITION<br />The Sector Operations/Procurement Practice Division of MCC's Department of Compact Operations (DCO) is seeking a full-time Personal Services Contractor (PSC) to serve as a Senior Program Officer (Procurement) for research and analysis of procedural issues affiliated with development of program procurement policy. The contractor shall work with procurement staff, resident country missions and multidisciplinary country-focused teams, supporting specific projects. The contractor shall perform a variety of assignments associated with the design, development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of international development projects. The position is at MCC headquarters in Washington, DC. <br />A personal services contract is different from non-personal services Government contract, which establishes an independent contract relationship. Under a non-personal services contract, the contractor or employees of the contractor are subject to the technical direction but not the supervision of the MCC. As defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.104, a personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor personnel. Thus, the PSC is subject to the relatively continuous technical direction, supervision, and control of the MCC. PSCs may be assigned inherently governmental duties (see FAR 7.502). By law and by the contract's terms, the PSC is subject to most of the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the direct hire employee such as MCC regulations, conflict of interest, under some circumstances MCC authorized employment security clearances, and financial disclosure. However, under the MCC personal services contract authority, PSCs are not employees for purposes of laws administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The following elements apply to this contact:<br />(1) Performance on site. <br />(2) Principal tools and equipment furnished by the Government. <br />(3) Services are applied directly to the integral effort of agencies or an organizational subpart in furtherance of assigned function or mission. <br />(4) Comparable services, meeting comparable needs, are performed in the same or similar agencies using civil service personnel. <br />(5) The need for the type of service provided can reasonably be expected to last beyond 1 year. <br />(6) The inherent nature of the service, or the manner in which it is provided, reasonably requires directly or indirectly, Government direction or supervision of contractor employees in order to- <br />(i) Adequately protect the Government's interest;<br />(ii) Retain control of the function involved; or <br />(iii) Retain full personal responsibility for the function supported in a duly authorized Federal officer or employee. <br />PLEASE NOTE: This contract shall be awarded solely to individual(s), not to a firm. The individual must have an active DUNS # and a fully approved and active record in the System for Award Management (SAM).</p>
<p>KEY REQUIREMENTS<br />&bull; U.S. citizenship or legal, permanent resident with five years of residency history. <br />&bull; Must be able to obtain and maintain a federal security clearance.<br />&bull; Performance at MCC Headquarters in Washington, D.C.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>
<p>(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.);</p>

<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

      (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25.  For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.
  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-
    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
    (1) Listed end products.
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin

    (2) __ Outside the United States.
  (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
    [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that-
      (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;
      (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003- 4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and

    [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003- 4(d)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that-

      (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
      (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
  (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)
    (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
    (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).  If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(End of Clause)<br />ADDENDUM to FAR CLAUSE 52.212-4: the following paragraphs are added to the clause:<br />(2) FAR 52.217-7 OPTION FOR INCREASED QUANTITY - SEPARATELY PRICED LINE ITEM (MAR 1989) - VARIATION</p>
<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence, initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>

<p>(a) Contractors are required to comply with federal, state and local VOC compliance laws and regulations. Among other requirements, certain Contractors may also be required to operate pursuant to a Title V permit. The need for such a permit will depend on the provisions of the applicable state's "State Implementation Plan" (SIP) and the type/quantity of the Contractor's regulated emissions, including VOCs.

<p>(11) GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any Quotation submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the Quotation includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the Quotation.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor and shall be included in the Composite Labor Rate. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>(12) DISCOVERIES AND CHANGES TO CONTRACT<br />Work requests can be transmitted electronically by using email. The bullets below display the process of how work requests are to be followed during an availability:</p>

Approved Work Request- Forwarded to Contractor and COR by the KO<br />8. Modification to Contract- The KS/KO will issue a modification covering all WR's</p>
<p>(13) COMPOSITE LABOR RATE</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:</p>
<p>(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, consumables, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); <br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br /><br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating Material Handling<br />Housekeeping Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration Security Testing<br />(8) all consumables;</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>(14) MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT</p>
<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the Contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the Contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the Contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed. <br /><br />2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The Contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the Contractor at time of award. The Contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified. Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The Contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the Contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all Government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the Contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br /><br />4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The Contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(15) CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p>(16) CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</p>
<p>(a) The U.S. Coast Guard Surface Forces Logistic Center (SFLC) will monitor and evaluate the successful offeror's past performance of this contract and prepare a Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) in accordance with FAR Part 42.15.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (BPA) TERMS & CONDITIONS
THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE MANDATORY:
1.  DESCRIPTION OF AGREEMENT: 
The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) is proposing to issue multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for a period up to sixty (60) months for the acquisition of Electrophysiology (EP) Catheters.  This requirement is unrestricted.  

 Electrophysiology is a medical branch related to the study of electrical activity within the body. Catheters are slim, bendable tubes used in medical procedures or in ablation of cardiac tissues responsible for heart arrhythmia disorders. Physicians pass catheters through veins, arteries or organs to more effectively monitor activity in various areas of the body. EP catheter placement is done without surgery and the instruments are used to provide electrical pacing, recording, sensing, localization or mapping.  Cardiac ablation is a popular procedure in which physicians guide EP catheters through blood vessels into the heart to destroy diseased tissue. The EP Catheters and products are used for diagnostic testing and treatment for both invasive (intra-cardiac) and non-invasive procedures and are a critical part of cardiac patient care. 
The Contractor shall ensure that any product provided under this BPA is approved in accordance with the pre-market notification process under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510K Program and labeled accordingly.

The BPA, including product, prices, and other terms and conditions, is public information and is releasable under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Procurement related information, including negotiations, shall be treated as confidential and shall not be disclosed except as required by applicable laws and regulations.
The BPA holder shall provide written notice to the Department of Veterans Affairs, Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) BPA Administrator, of any changes, specifically to any items on this resultant BPA.  Changes include, but are not limited to, price increases and decreases, product deletions, new technological refreshes to its product lines or of new product introductions, and/or change in vendor company information including contract administrator, company name, address and phone number.  All orders placed against this BPA are subject to the terms and conditions and contained herein and all clauses and provisions in full text or incorporated by reference herein.

2.  PERIOD OF AGREEMENT: 
This BPA shall be established for a period of up to sixty (60) months from the effective date of the BPA and will remain in effect for the 60 months or until it is terminated in accordance with the terms of this BPA, whichever is earlier. In accordance with FAR 13.303-6(b)(1),  the Contracting Officer  shall conduct an annual review of the established BPA.  Upon completion of the annual review, a determination will be made whether or not it is in the best interest of the Government to continue with performance of the BPA.  The maximum BPA ordering period is 60 months .

3.  EXTENT OF OBLIGATION:
 The Government is obligated only to the extent of authorized purchases actually made under the resultant BPA.  This BPA does not obligate any funds, nor is the Government obligated to make any purchases under this BPA. The Government does not guarantee any volume of purchases through a BPA. The terms and conditions included in this BPA apply to all purchases made pursuant to it.  In the event of an inconsistency between the provisions of this BPA and the BPA Holder's invoice, the provisions of this BPA will take precedence. 
3.1	Uninterrupted Source of Supply- By establishing an agreement, the offeror agrees to supply established item(s) to satisfy the Government's requirement when an order is placed under the BPA during the effective period of the established agreement.  If, however, the offeror determines to terminate production of the selected item and contemplates replacement with alternative item, the Government reserves the right to evaluate the potential replacement item(s).  There is no guarantee that the Government will evaluate any replacement item(s) favorably.  If the Government determines the replacement item(s) as unacceptable, the individual item(s) or the entire BPA may be cancelled
3.2	Inspection and Acceptance- The acceptance paragraph in FAR 52.212-4 is based upon the assumption that the Government will rely on the contractor's assurances that the commercial item tendered for acceptance conforms to the agreement requirements.  The Government inspection of commercial items will not prejudice its other rights under the acceptance paragraph.  The provisions of FAR 52.212-4 are incorporated by reference.

4.  PURCHASE LIMITATION: 
Ordering Officials may place orders against this agreement in excess of the SAT up to $6.5M as long as the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items under FAR Subpart 13.5 is in effect.  Ordering Officials shall validate the SAT limitation and whether the Test Program under FAR Subpart 13.5 is in effect prior to placing any orders. 
In accordance with FAR Subpart 13.3(13.303-5(c)), the existence of a BPA does not justify purchasing from only one source or avoiding small business set-asides. FAR 13.303-5(d) requires that for a particular purchase greater than the micro-purchase threshold, and there is an insufficient number of BPAs to ensure maximum practicable competition, the contracting officer shall-
(1)	Solicit quotations from other sources (see 13.105) and make the purchase as appropriate; and

If the literature does not sufficiently demonstrate product compliance with the minimum technical requirements the offeror may supplement the descriptive literature with a written technical document explaining how the specification is met provided such document is submitted on letterhead of the offeror with signature, title, email address and phone number of the preparer signed by a person who may bind the entity. 
"Descriptive Literature," as used in this RFQ, means information (including, but not limited to, cuts, illustrations, drawings, service manuals, and brochures) that is submitted as part of an quotation.  Descriptive literature is required to verify, for the purpose of evaluation and establishment, details of the product offered that are specified in the minimum technical requirements.
To demonstrate that a quoted product is technically acceptable, descriptive literature (1) shall identify the product and highlight the item(s) of the offer to which it applies and (2) shall show the appropriate model and type and all component items for functions offered (if applicable) and (3) shall demonstrate that all quoted products are in compliance with all of the minimum technical requirements, listed on page 12 of the solicitation.  This descriptive literature must be received by the Government by the time specified in this RFQ for receipt of quotations.

The contractor's price quote must be separated from the technical submittal. The contractor shall propose firm fixed price.

Each EP Catheter shall have its own separate pricing list with the EP Catheters products and pricing. Please see the example below:

VOLUME III - SOLICITATION, OFFER AND AWARD
DOCUMENTS AND CERTIFICATIONS/REPRESENTATIONS
Certifications and Representations - An authorized official of the firm shall sign the SF 1449 and all certifications requiring original signature. An Acrobat PDF file shall be created to capture the signatures for submission.  This Volume shall contain the following:
Solicitation Section A - Standard Form (SF1449) and Acknowledgement of Amendments, if any.
Any provisions that require fill in. 
Offerors are hereby advised that any Offeror-imposed terms and conditions which deviate from the Government's material terms and conditions established by the Solicitation, may render the Offeror's proposal Unacceptable, and thus ineligible for award.
 (End of Addendum to 52.212-1)

E.4  ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2  EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
  (a) The Government will issue a up to a maximum of twelve (12) BPAs resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. This will be Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).
A.  BASIS OF AWARD:  BPAs will be issued to the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote.  In order to be considered for a BPA, the quote must be determined to be technically acceptable.  To be determined technically acceptable, all MTR's for the products quoted must be met.  Award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer. To receive consideration for a BPA, a rating of Acceptable must be achieved for the Technical Factor.
B.  FACTORS TO BE EVALUATED:
1.  TECHNICAL
2.  PRICE

C.  EVALUATION APPROACH:  
All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes.  The proposal will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content.  Quotes which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient.  BPAs will be established with quotes whose price for items are lowest among all quotes that were deemed to be technically acceptable for the product quoted. Quoters who fail to meet the minimum technical requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for a BPA for the product.
1.   TECHNICAL EVALUATION APPROACH.  The evaluation process will consider whether the proposal demonstrates a clear understanding of the technical features involved in meeting the solicitation requirements.
Descriptive literature (and supplemental technical proposals, if deemed necessary by offeror to supplement the descriptive literature) will be evaluated to determine whether the quoted items meet all of the minimum technical requirements (described below) and are thus considered technically acceptable.  Any quoted product that does not meet all of the minimum technical requirements will be deemed technically unacceptable, and thus ineligible for award.   
	2.   PRICE EVALUATION APPROACH.  Proposed pricing shall be provided on a unit price line basis in for each product offered that meets the minimum technical requirements as stated in Instructions to Offerors, Volume II. The Government will evaluate offers by conducting a random sampling of each product description type offered per line item price. The random sampling of the product will be compared with the similar type and size offered for each product description per offeror.
Unbalanced Pricing - The Government may evaluate whether the Offeror has submitted unbalanced pricing.  An unbalanced price is one where the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated and which will result in the Government paying an unreasonably high price for contract performance or otherwise present an unacceptable level of risk to the Government.  If the Contracting Officer determines that the risk is unacceptable, then the bid or offer can be rejected.
	3.   The Government will evaluate Volume III of the Instructions to Offeror, including all the amendments and provisions are completed and signed accordingly.

<DESC>"THIS IS A SUBCONTRACTING OPPORTUNITY"<br /><br /><br />INTRODUCTION<br />Homestead Job Corps is seeking quotes to install an above ground diesel storage tank. An existing 4,000 gallon underground diesel fuel tank in the screened equipment yard on west side of Dining Hall, Building P serves the emergency generator. The installed date of this tank is not known but according to documentation this tank was in this location prior to 1994. The center has no records of leak tests, corrosion protection, or maintenance for this tank. The center hired a certified underground storage tank contractor to evaluate the tank per Florida regulations and found that the tank does not meet current RCRA standards. It would be more cost-effective to replace the underground tank with an aboveground tank. (40 CFR 280)
<p>SCOPE OF WORK<br />Close the existing underground storage tank in place and in accordance with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) regulations. FDEP must be notified of plans to close the Underground storage tank in place. Remove associated controls and piping according to EPA and state requirements for tank closure. <br />Provide and install a new 2,000 gallon above ground diesel storage tank with all tank accessories, equipment, piping and concrete coated exterior to resist weather and reflect sunlight. The tank construction and installation shall comply with the requirement of UL 142 and NFPA 30.</p>
<p>The quote consists of labor and materials. Quote must list labor and material costs separately. Contractor must provide all materials necessary to complete project.</p>
<p><br />PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />The period of performance for this project will be determined after contractor selection has been made.<br /><br />LOCATION<br />The selected vendor for this project will perform the work at Homestead Job Corps Center, Food Service Building, 12350 SW 285 Street, Homestead, FL 33033.</p>

The specification calls for availabilty to fit a 7 to 12" mattress.. <BR> <BR>My question is, does our company have to have at least 500 employees or does that mean up to 500 employees?  This means if you have 500 employees or less you are a small business when you are considering bidding on this NAICS code classification <BR> <BR>Is it a requirement for the encasements to be manufactured in the U.S. or a Trade Agreement Act countries acceptable?A trade agreement country is acceptable. <BR> <BR>Does buyer just want the "Mattress" protector or also the "Box Spring" protector? The reason we ask is because the dimensions specified by buyer of 38"x80"x9" is for the combination set for BOTH the mattress AND box spring set. The Protect a Bed "BUG PROTECTION" Cover for the "TWIN XL" MATTRESS ONLY has dimensions of 38"x80"x8.5". Thank you Interested SDVOSB seller:  Mattress only please <BR> <BR>

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR. <br />(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to- <br />(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);<br />(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.);<br />(3) The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701, et seq.);<br />(4) The Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR Parts 730-774); <br />(5) The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR Parts 120-130); and<br />(6) Executive Order 13222, as extended.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.</p>
<p>Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Brothers Elizabeth City, NC 27909 NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.</span></p>

The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon written request, with adequate assurances of future performance. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount computed under paragraph (i) Payments of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours expended in furnishing work not delivered to or accepted by the Government shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this clause, the portion of the "hourly rate" attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. In the event of termination for cause, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.</span></p>

BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (BPA) TERMS & CONDITIONS
THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE MANDATORY:
1.  DESCRIPTION OF AGREEMENT: 
The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) is proposing to issue multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for a period up to sixty (60) months for the acquisition of Electrophysiology (EP) Catheters.  This requirement is unrestricted.  

 Electrophysiology is a medical branch related to the study of electrical activity within the body. Catheters are slim, bendable tubes used in medical procedures or in ablation of cardiac tissues responsible for heart arrhythmia disorders. Physicians pass catheters through veins, arteries or organs to more effectively monitor activity in various areas of the body. EP catheter placement is done without surgery and the instruments are used to provide electrical pacing, recording, sensing, localization or mapping.  Cardiac ablation is a popular procedure in which physicians guide EP catheters through blood vessels into the heart to destroy diseased tissue. The EP Catheters and products are used for diagnostic testing and treatment for both invasive (intra-cardiac) and non-invasive procedures and are a critical part of cardiac patient care. 
The Contractor shall ensure that any product provided under this BPA is approved in accordance with the pre-market notification process under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510K Program and labeled accordingly.

The BPA, including product, prices, and other terms and conditions, is public information and is releasable under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Procurement related information, including negotiations, shall be treated as confidential and shall not be disclosed except as required by applicable laws and regulations.
The BPA holder shall provide written notice to the Department of Veterans Affairs, Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) BPA Administrator, of any changes, specifically to any items on this resultant BPA.  Changes include, but are not limited to, price increases and decreases, product deletions, new technological refreshes to its product lines or of new product introductions, and/or change in vendor company information including contract administrator, company name, address and phone number.  All orders placed against this BPA are subject to the terms and conditions and contained herein and all clauses and provisions in full text or incorporated by reference herein.

2.  PERIOD OF AGREEMENT: 
This BPA shall be established for a period of up to sixty (60) months from the effective date of the BPA and will remain in effect for the 60 months or until it is terminated in accordance with the terms of this BPA, whichever is earlier. In accordance with FAR 13.303-6(b)(1),  the Contracting Officer  shall conduct an annual review of the established BPA.  Upon completion of the annual review, a determination will be made whether or not it is in the best interest of the Government to continue with performance of the BPA.  The maximum BPA ordering period is 60 months .

3.  EXTENT OF OBLIGATION:
 The Government is obligated only to the extent of authorized purchases actually made under the resultant BPA.  This BPA does not obligate any funds, nor is the Government obligated to make any purchases under this BPA. The Government does not guarantee any volume of purchases through a BPA. The terms and conditions included in this BPA apply to all purchases made pursuant to it.  In the event of an inconsistency between the provisions of this BPA and the BPA Holder's invoice, the provisions of this BPA will take precedence. 
3.1	Uninterrupted Source of Supply- By establishing an agreement, the offeror agrees to supply established item(s) to satisfy the Government's requirement when an order is placed under the BPA during the effective period of the established agreement.  If, however, the offeror determines to terminate production of the selected item and contemplates replacement with alternative item, the Government reserves the right to evaluate the potential replacement item(s).  There is no guarantee that the Government will evaluate any replacement item(s) favorably.  If the Government determines the replacement item(s) as unacceptable, the individual item(s) or the entire BPA may be cancelled
3.2	Inspection and Acceptance- The acceptance paragraph in FAR 52.212-4 is based upon the assumption that the Government will rely on the contractor's assurances that the commercial item tendered for acceptance conforms to the agreement requirements.  The Government inspection of commercial items will not prejudice its other rights under the acceptance paragraph.  The provisions of FAR 52.212-4 are incorporated by reference.

4.  PURCHASE LIMITATION: 
Ordering Officials may place orders against this agreement in excess of the SAT up to $6.5M as long as the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items under FAR Subpart 13.5 is in effect.  Ordering Officials shall validate the SAT limitation and whether the Test Program under FAR Subpart 13.5 is in effect prior to placing any orders. 
In accordance with FAR Subpart 13.3(13.303-5(c)), the existence of a BPA does not justify purchasing from only one source or avoiding small business set-asides. FAR 13.303-5(d) requires that for a particular purchase greater than the micro-purchase threshold, and there is an insufficient number of BPAs to ensure maximum practicable competition, the contracting officer shall-

Solicitation Section A - Standard Form (SF1449) and Acknowledgement of Amendments, if any.
Any provisions that require fill in. 
Offerors are hereby advised that any Offeror-imposed terms and conditions which deviate from the Government's material terms and conditions established by the Solicitation, may render the Offeror's proposal Unacceptable, and thus ineligible for award.
 (End of Addendum to 52.212-1)

E.4  ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2  EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
  (a) The Government will issue a up to a maximum of twelve (12) BPAs resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. This will be Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).
A.  BASIS OF AWARD:  BPAs will be issued to the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote.  In order to be considered for a BPA, the quote must be determined to be technically acceptable.  To be determined technically acceptable, all MTR's for the products quoted must be met.  Award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer. To receive consideration for a BPA, a rating of Acceptable must be achieved for the Technical Factor.
B.  FACTORS TO BE EVALUATED:
1.  TECHNICAL
2.  PRICE

C.  EVALUATION APPROACH:  
All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes.  The proposal will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content.  Quotes which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient.  BPAs will be established with quotes whose price for items are lowest among all quotes that were deemed to be technically acceptable for the product quoted. Quoters who fail to meet the minimum technical requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for a BPA for the product.
1.   TECHNICAL EVALUATION APPROACH.  The evaluation process will consider whether the proposal demonstrates a clear understanding of the technical features involved in meeting the solicitation requirements.
Descriptive literature (and supplemental technical proposals, if deemed necessary by offeror to supplement the descriptive literature) will be evaluated to determine whether the quoted items meet all of the minimum technical requirements (described below) and are thus considered technically acceptable.  Any quoted product that does not meet all of the minimum technical requirements will be deemed technically unacceptable, and thus ineligible for award.   
	2.   PRICE EVALUATION APPROACH.  Proposed pricing shall be provided on a unit price line basis in for each product offered that meets the minimum technical requirements as stated in Instructions to Offerors, Volume II. The Government will evaluate offers by conducting a random sampling of each product description type offered per line item price. The random sampling of the product will be compared with the similar type and size offered for each product description per offeror.
Unbalanced Pricing - The Government may evaluate whether the Offeror has submitted unbalanced pricing.  An unbalanced price is one where the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated and which will result in the Government paying an unreasonably high price for contract performance or otherwise present an unacceptable level of risk to the Government.  If the Contracting Officer determines that the risk is unacceptable, then the bid or offer can be rejected.
	3.   The Government will evaluate Volume III of the Instructions to Offeror, including all the amendments and provisions are completed and signed accordingly.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to address questions and answers pertaining to RFQ VA119-14-Q-0103_4

Question 1: Currently, we do not have an indirect strategy for EP Catheters.  As such, BWI is not involved in the MSPV program.  We do not believe our competitors are either. At this point, we sells these catheters direct. Given this is the case, are we still able to bid on this solicitation?
Answer 2: The requirement to be a part of authorized Medical/Surgical Prime Vendors (MSPV) has been deleted from the distribution section of the synopsis. Attachment-A Prime Vendor list has been deleted from the synopsis. 


Question 2: Will a full solicitation be issued with a 1449?

Answer 2: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

The Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) is proposing to issue multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with no more than twelve (12) companies that will provide Electrophysiology (EP) Catheters and products. The Government seeks to establish BPA's to include a manufacturer's complete product line for Electrophysiology Catheters and products.  Electrophysiology is a medical branch related to the study of electrical activity within the heart.  These catheters are slim, bendable or deflectable multi-electrode wires used in recording intra-cardiac electrical signals or in ablation of cardiac tissues responsible for heart rhythm disorders.  In addition, sheaths are tubes that are used to direct the catheters to specific areas in the heart and connectors linking the catheters to monitoring or ablation systems.  The EP Catheters and products are used for diagnostic testing and treatment for both invasive (intra-cardiac) and non-invasive procedures and are a critical part of cardiac patient care.  These items will be used in invasive cardiac electrophysiology laboratories and other procedural suites in the Veterans Health Administration for invasive electrophysiology and arrhythmia ablation procedures.

BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (BPA) TERMS & CONDITIONS
THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE MANDATORY:
1.  DESCRIPTION OF AGREEMENT: 
The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) is proposing to issue multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for a period up to sixty (60) months for the acquisition of Electrophysiology (EP) Catheters.  This requirement is unrestricted.  

Electrophysiology is a medical branch related to the study of electrical activity within the body. Catheters are slim, bendable tubes used in medical procedures or in ablation of cardiac tissues responsible for heart arrhythmia disorders. Physicians pass catheters through veins, arteries or organs to more effectively monitor activity in various areas of the body. EP catheter placement is done without surgery and the instruments are used to provide electrical pacing, recording, sensing, localization or mapping.  Cardiac ablation is a popular procedure in which physicians guide EP catheters through blood vessels into the heart to destroy diseased tissue. The EP Catheters and products are used for diagnostic testing and treatment for both invasive (intra-cardiac) and non-invasive procedures and are a critical part of cardiac patient care. 
The Contractor shall ensure that any product provided under this BPA is approved in accordance with the pre-market notification process under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510K Program and labeled accordingly.

The BPA, including product, prices, and other terms and conditions, is public information and is releasable under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Procurement related information, including negotiations, shall be treated as confidential and shall not be disclosed except as required by applicable laws and regulations.
The BPA holder shall provide written notice to the Department of Veterans Affairs, Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) BPA Administrator, of any changes, specifically to any items on this resultant BPA.  Changes include, but are not limited to, price increases and decreases, product deletions, new technological refreshes to its product lines or of new product introductions, and/or change in vendor company information including contract administrator, company name, address and phone number.  All orders placed against this BPA are subject to the terms and conditions and contained herein and all clauses and provisions in full text or incorporated by reference herein.

2.  PERIOD OF AGREEMENT: 
This BPA shall be established for a period of up to sixty (60) months from the effective date of the BPA and will remain in effect for the 60 months or until it is terminated in accordance with the terms of this BPA, whichever is earlier. In accordance with FAR 13.303-6(b)(1),  the Contracting Officer  shall conduct an annual review of the established BPA.  Upon completion of the annual review, a determination will be made whether or not it is in the best interest of the Government to continue with performance of the BPA.  The maximum BPA ordering period is 60 months.

3.  EXTENT OF OBLIGATION:
 The Government is obligated only to the extent of authorized purchases actually made under the resultant BPA.  This BPA does not obligate any funds, nor is the Government obligated to make any purchases under this BPA. The Government does not guarantee any volume of purchases through a BPA. The terms and conditions included in this BPA apply to all purchases made pursuant to it.  In the event of an inconsistency between the provisions of this BPA and the BPA Holder's invoice, the provisions of this BPA will take precedence. 
3.1	Uninterrupted Source of Supply- By establishing an agreement, the offeror agrees to supply established item(s) to satisfy the Government's requirement when an order is placed under the BPA during the effective period of the established agreement.  If, however, the offeror determines to terminate production of the selected item and contemplates replacement with alternative item, the Government reserves the right to evaluate the potential replacement item(s). There is no guarantee that the Government will evaluate any replacement item(s) favorably.  If the Government determines the replacement item(s) as unacceptable, the individual item(s) or the entire BPA may be cancelled
3.2	Inspection and Acceptance- The acceptance paragraph in FAR 52.212-4 is based upon the assumption that the Government will rely on the contractor's assurances that the commercial item tendered for acceptance conforms to the agreement requirements.  The Government inspection of commercial items will not prejudice its other rights under the acceptance paragraph. The provisions of FAR 52.212-4 are incorporated by reference.

4.  PURCHASE LIMITATION: 
Ordering Officials may place orders against this agreement in excess of the SAT up to $6.5M as long as the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items under FAR Subpart 13.5 is in effect.  Ordering Officials shall validate the SAT limitation and whether the Test Program under FAR Subpart 13.5 is in effect prior to placing any orders. 
In accordance with FAR Subpart 13.3(13.303-5(c)), the existence of a BPA does not justify purchasing from only one source or avoiding small business set-asides. FAR 13.303-5(d) requires that for a particular purchase greater than the micro-purchase threshold, and there is an insufficient number of BPAs to ensure maximum practicable competition, the contracting officer shall-
(1)	Solicit quotations from other sources (see 13.105) and make the purchase as appropriate; and

Solicitation Section A - Standard Form (SF1449) and Acknowledgement of Amendments, if any.
Any provisions that require fill in. 
Offerors are hereby advised that any Offeror-imposed terms and conditions which deviate from the Government's material terms and conditions established by the Solicitation, may render the Offeror's proposal Unacceptable, and thus ineligible for award.
 (End of Addendum to 52.212-1)

E.4  ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2  EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)
  (a) The Government will issue a up to a maximum of twelve (12) BPAs resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. This will be Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).
A.  BASIS OF AWARD:  BPAs will be issued to the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote.  In order to be considered for a BPA, the quote must be determined to be technically acceptable.  To be determined technically acceptable, all MTR's for the products quoted must be met.  Award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer. To receive consideration for a BPA, a rating of Acceptable must be achieved for the Technical Factor.
B.  FACTORS TO BE EVALUATED:
1.  TECHNICAL
2.  PRICE

C.  EVALUATION APPROACH:  
All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes.  The proposal will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content.  Quotes which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient.  BPAs will be established with quotes whose price for items are lowest among all quotes that were deemed to be technically acceptable for the product quoted. Quoters who fail to meet the minimum technical requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for a BPA for the product.
1.   TECHNICAL EVALUATION APPROACH.  The evaluation process will consider whether the proposal demonstrates a clear understanding of the technical features involved in meeting the solicitation requirements.
Descriptive literature (and supplemental technical proposals, if deemed necessary by offeror to supplement the descriptive literature) will be evaluated to determine whether the quoted items meet all of the minimum technical requirements (described below) and are thus considered technically acceptable.  Any quoted product that does not meet all of the minimum technical requirements will be deemed technically unacceptable, and thus ineligible for award.   
	2.   PRICE EVALUATION APPROACH.  Proposed pricing shall be provided on a unit price line basis in for each product offered that meets the minimum technical requirements as stated in Instructions to Offerors, Volume II. The Government will evaluate offers by conducting a random sampling of each product description type offered per line item price. The random sampling of the product will be compared with the similar type and size offered for each product description per offeror.
Unbalanced Pricing - The Government may evaluate whether the Offeror has submitted unbalanced pricing.  An unbalanced price is one where the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated and which will result in the Government paying an unreasonably high price for contract performance or otherwise present an unacceptable level of risk to the Government.  If the Contracting Officer determines that the risk is unacceptable, then the bid or offer can be rejected.
	3.   The Government will evaluate Volume III of the Instructions to Offeror, including all the amendments and provisions are completed and signed accordingly.

Answer 12: No, a modification will not be issued if the purchase order exceeds the $6.5M. Ordering Officials may place orders against this agreement in excess of the SAT up to $6.5M as long as the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items under FAR Subpart 13.5 is in effect.  Ordering Officials shall validate the SAT limitation and whether the Test Program under FAR Subpart 13.5 is in effect prior to placing any orders. 
In accordance with FAR Subpart 13.3(13.303-5(c)), the existence of a BPA does not justify purchasing from only one source or avoiding small business set-asides. FAR 13.303-5(d) requires that for a particular purchase greater than the micro-purchase threshold, and there is an insufficient number of BPAs to ensure maximum practicable competition, the contracting officer shall-
(1)	Solicit quotations from other sources (see 13.105) and make the purchase as appropriate; and
(2) Establish additional BPAs to facilitate future purchases if-
(i) Recurring requirements for the same or similar supplies or services seem likely;
(ii) Qualified sources are willing to accept BPAs; and
(iii) It is otherwise practical to do so.

Question 13: Can you please let us know if you will be posting the Standard Form (SF1449) for VA119-14-Q-0103 as required in Volume III for the offer?
Answer 13: This question was already addressed in Amendment to Combined Solicitation VA119-14-Q-0103_4. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The language in Volume III-Solicitation, Offer and Award has removed the language of a SF 1449 form and replaced with the following: Solicitation Section A - Combined Solicitation and Acknowledgement of Amendments to Combined Solicitation, if any.

<DESC>This Notice of Intent is to notify industry that the current contract N62645-14-D-5002 has a need for additional antibodies.<br /><br />An unforeseen rate of antibodies was used to perform the proper validation of the Government owned equipment which caused a substantial depletion in the Antibodies for Slide Strainers'. This usage rate is due to several factors. The Laboratory added a number of new antibodies to its product list. Each antibody requires an average of twenty-eight (28) slides for optimization and validation, with each slide requiring a label and quantities of bulk fluids. The larger antibody menu has resulted in additional requests for patient testing. Taken together, these factors have resulted in staining a significantly larger number of slides than what had originally been anticipated. This unforeseen usage rate required an increase in workload and is the cause for NMCSD Laboratory to increase the current contract. This increase will be necessary for NMCSD to continue utilizing the current contract N62645-14-D-5002 and have the ability to accommodate the increase of patient care over the life of the contract.

This RFI is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP), a Request for Quotation (RFQ), an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Solicitation, or an indication that the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) will contract for the items contained in this RFI. The information requested herein will be used within DHHS', Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and the Office of Acquisition Management, Contracts &amp; Grants (AMCG) to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside of the agency. Please note that DHHS is NOT responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>As we continue to support efforts to address the recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the Government is interested in information from vendors relative to the Formulation, Fill and Finish of new drug products. This information includes vendor's capability to complete transfer and manufacture of cGMP formulation, filling and finishing activities at target concentrations, which will be defined as part of the transfer process, prior to GMP manufacturing activities. These new products are Live Vectored Vaccines (LVV), and because these products are in very early development stage, there is a high likelihood that the products will have limited stability data, time out of refrigeration data, and to best ensure product quality, will require freezing and storage at low temperatures (&lt; - 80C). There are multiple products being considered. In addition, some regulatory agencies may require that these processes take place in a Biological Safety Level 2 (BSL2) facility.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking vendor information/capability on the filling of products similar to the ones listed below:</p>
<p>1. RVSVdG eBOV vaccine replication-competent live virus vaccine utilizes a recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (rVSV) lacking the native VSV glycoprotein (&Delta;G) and bearing the glycoprotein (GP) of ZEBOV, which is the target of protective immunity. The rVSV&Delta;G ZEBOV is an attenuated virus and capable of limited replication after administration, which is believed to be the basis for the potent immunogenicity of this vaccine vector.</p>
<p>2. rVSVN4CT1-Z-EboV Vaccine utilizes attenuated replication-competent rVSV vector that is injected IM, it undergoes limited propagation at the injection site and in the local draining lymph nodes, but does not spread to other organs and tissues.</p>
<p>Drug substances are currently being developed and manufactured to support these, and other similar LVV products. Products will require formulation to set target concentrations. Final concentrations will be provided by the U.S. Government prior to GMP manufacturing. The final filled containers will require labeling, storing and shipping. Final release of the lots will be performed by the original intellectual property owner, or their designee.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Submission Information / Instructions:</strong></p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325414.</p>
<p>It is requested that interested parties submit a capability package to include the following:</p>
<p>1. Contractor name, address, phone number, business size, contact person; <br />2. Brief description of contractor experience; <br />3. Description of work performed relative to the filling of similar products as listed above;<br />4. Would the filling of similar products as listed above be undertaken at your facility or subcontracted out? And<br />5. How much advanced notice, if any, would be required to accommodate the filling for similar products?</p>
<p><br />Please limit the capability package to no more than eight (8) pages. The capability package must be clear, concise and complete.</p>
<p>Please submit an electronic copy of your capability package no later than:</p>
<p><strong>12:00 PM, EST on Friday, December 5, 2014.</strong></p>
<p>Your capability package shall be submitted to the following addresses:</p>
<p><a href="mailto:quintin.hackshaw@hhs.gov">quintin.hackshaw@hhs.gov</a>&nbsp;and <br /><a href="mailto:tammy.mcleod@hhs.gov">tammy.mcleod@hhs.gov</a></p>
<p>All questions concerning this RFI must be submitted via e-mail to both e-mail addresses listed herein.</p>
<p>Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. To aid DHHS, please segregate and clearly mark proprietary information. Please be advised that all submissions become the property of the Government and will not be returned.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The Indian Health Service (IHS) develops and supports a comprehensive integrated health information system of systems which supports a broad range of clinical and business functions at IHS, Tribal and Urban (I/T/U) hospitals and clinics across the country. The Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) is similar to the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) in use at the Veterans Administration, having been derived from the same legacy system and sharing many of the same infrastructure and business applications. The RPMS as currently deployed has a MUMPS (Intersystems Cache) database architecture and VA FileMan file structures. A number of graphical user interface (GUI) applications utilizing various languages ranging from Delphi to C# .NET have been developed to support certain business processes, while other applications retain legacy character-based interfaces. RPMS GUI applications principally use a two-tiered architecture utilizing broker-based remote procedure calls, although recent development has focused on a three-tier architecture using web services. For more information on the portfolio of supported applications, visit: http://www.ihs.gov/RPMS/ <br />Business functions supported by the RPMS include, but are not limited to, practice management (e.g. patient registration, scheduling, billing and accounts receivable, release of information), ancillary clinical applications (e.g. inpatient and outpatient pharmacy, laboratory, radiology, image archiving, consults and referrals), and point of care clinical applications for behavioral health, inpatient and ambulatory care. The RPMS is certified as a Complete Electronic Health Record for inpatient and ambulatory settings according to the 2014 version certification criteria published by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. In recent years, the system has been extended to include a personal health record system, Direct secure messaging, a health information exchange (HIE) service, and supporting middleware services. In recent years the architecture and complexity of IHS health IT systems as well as their criticality to health care operations have become an impetus for IHS to re-evaluate its current approach to software development.<br />This Sources Sought Notice seeks to identify companies that have capability to provide full lifecycle software development, architecture, and operations support services to assist IHS with evolving the RPMS, as well as the software lifecycle programs and processes around the system, to align with current best practices in application architecture, design and management. The IHS strategy includes improvements in data modeling and mapping, transition to a true service-oriented architecture (SOA), and harmonization of disparate GUIs into a common interface framework compliant with accessibility and usability best practices in a platform-independent context (i.e. support for Web, mobile, machine, and other ancillary interfaces). IHS also seeks to continuously mature its governance model, project and portfolio management, system development life cycle, security integration, and software quality assurance processes.<br />While IHS is not specifying a specific SDLC, understanding the capabilities of an organization's proven methodology is critical. IHS is particularly interested in identifying sources that have successfully implemented and adopted a methodology that is akin to the Scaled Agile&reg; Framework or the Enterprise Unified Process. The reason for interest in this type of methodology is the need to support iterative development practices in a large, regulated, federal, health care environment.<br />The projected scope of this requirement is estimated to reach $125 million over (5) years. Interested small businesses, with a high level of expertise and demonstrable past performance compatible with the IHS objectives described above are invited to submit capability statements.
