Please refer all contracting related questions to Lt Jimmy Ober, (937) 255-2619 ext 3002, jimmy.ober@wpafb.af.mil and all technical related questions to the Program Manager, Capt Joey Stengell, (937) 255-7210 ext. 3909 joey.stengell@wpafb.af.mil  The Aeronautical Systems Center intends to solicit and award a contract to continue development activities for the Extended -1553 Databus project with the objective of increasing the capability of the existing -1553 databus to perform in accordance with real-time operating principles. Resultant enhancements will be incorporated into a revised military standard and handbook for use in future procurements. The goal is to cost-effectively enable the upgrading of legacy Air Force and DoD mobile war fighting support platforms with additional capability that adheres to real time operating system principles required in a network-centric environment. The Government anticipates awarding a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF)/IDIQ contract.  The period of performance will be 10 years (5 year base and 5 option years) with a value of $100M dollars. Æ’Ãž	The Contractor must be able to demonstrate the following: the  capability to demonstrate data throughput in excess of 200 megabits per second (Mbps) without any compression over existing aircraft wiring while adhering to a 10-12 bit error rate (BER), backward compatibility to the existing -1553 protocol, and adherence to real-time operating principles.  The contractor shall have documented experience with complex development and integration programs involving databus systems.  The contractor is required to provide analysis, simulation, and hardware verification of his proposed baseline design as part of his submittal. The design shall address the functional capabilities defined in this RFI to reflect a low risk approach to meeting the requirements.  The contractor shall also provide a detailed road map that defines the capabilities that need to be added to his product and integrated into revisions to a new standard for at least two sets of standard revisions. These added capabilities shall provide incremental improvements in performance, flexibility, integration, and lowered overall development cost. Thirty days after contract award the respondents must demonstrate multi-drop (thirty-one terminals) and 200 Mbps capability without data compression.  These demonstrations will be conducted under the conditions of 10-12 bit error rate (BER), 328 feet (100 meters) of -1553 cable, and concurrency with operation of standard -1553 data bus messages (1 Mbps) on the same wiring. Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities not to exceed twenty-five pages addressing the following areas: 1.	Real time engineering principles required Â¡V this area must be  supported by a complete mathematical foundation that provides a closed form solution.   End to end simulation and analysis must be provided to demonstrate the fidelity of the submitterÂ¡Â¦s design approach and selected engineering principles.  All math and associated principles shall be presented in detail sufficient to prove that all aspects are understood and that guaranteed predictable performance will be provided for all functionality. a.	The contractor is required to provide analysis, simulation, and  hardware verification of his proposed baseline design and his utilization of his selected real time engineering principals as part of his submittal. The design shall address the functional capabilities defined in this RFI to reflect a low risk approach to meeting the requirements. b.	The contractor will define his approach to reducing overall development  cost of avionics with use of his implementation of real time engineering principles. This approach will provide a closed form solution sufficient to guarantee that performance is predictable and will accurately reflect actual hardware operation.  2.	Functionality Â¡V the following functionalities will be addressed  including the theory for guaranteed performance: a.	Design/theory for real time performance that includes graceful  degradation b.	End-to-end diagnostics (100% including wiring opens/shorts/degradation  with accurate fault isolation of 100% of failures/intermittents) c.	Wiring fault (open/short/degradation) location within an accuracy of  six inches d.	High utilization (greater than 60%)  3.

<DESC>ELECTRIC POWER MANAGEMENT ADVISOR

The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Technical Assistance (BUDGET Team) is competitively recruiting one individual to serve as Electric Power Management Advisor to the Ministry of Energy, Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo.  The term of the Advisor position is a one year personal services contract, with the possibility of a time extension.  The Advisor will reside in Kinshasa.

   In some cases, the Office of Technical Assistance would be willing to negotiate a reimbursable agreement with the current employer of the prospective Advisor in order for the selected candidate to maintain unbroken service with his/her long-term employer.

The objective of the advisor is to maximize economic and financial benefits from the Inga Dam complex.  Currently, the complex is producing 740 MW of energy, well below the estimated 44,000 MW potential of the Congo River at that site.  The dam complex is managed by SNEL, a state-owned corporation.

The Minister of Energy has requested an Advisor to assist the Ministry of Energy develop strategies for the generation, transmission and distribution of energy produced at Inga.  Specifically, the Minister requested assistance with the following issues: 
•	Evaluate proposals for development of generation and transmission facilities at Inga
•	Research the energy needs of sub-Sahara Africa
•	Develop pricing models for the export of electricity
•	Identify potential sources of investment finance, including joint ventures
•	Develop marketing and promotion strategies
•	Prepare plans for training Ministry staff

The advisor will also recommend measures to promote private investment in the Inga Dam complex and related transmission infrastructure.  

The Advisor will report directly to the Minister of Energy.  It is anticipated that the advisor will interact on a daily basis with other officials of the Ministry as necessary and appropriate.  

The Advisor will be a member of the US Mission to the DRC, and thus will receive equivalent family services due US diplomatic staff, including security, housing, health, education for dependent children, and commissary.  The Advisor will be a member of the Budget Team of the Office of Technical Assistance.
 


Qualifications:  Candidates are expected to have senior-level experience in two or more of the bulleted functions cited above, with a working knowledge of additional bulleted items.  Therefore, the candidate may have an engineering, economic, finance or marketing background, but must have experience outside of his/her area of specialization.   Because the scope of work of the Advisor is very broad, the Advisor will be expected to identify needs for additional expert assistance within the Advisor’s scope of work.  Experience must be gained with a generator and/or marketer of hydropower.  While not required, overseas experience in developing countries and proficiency in French are preferred.     Applicants must be U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens.     

Salaries and Benefits:     Salaries are negotiated in accordance with program regulations, based on demonstrated salary history and the skills required.     The salary ranges from $85,000 to $145,600, subject to January 1, 2005, cost of living adjustments (COLA).  Successful applicants will be subject to a background investigation at the appropriate level.     Overseas benefits are provided as allowed by federal regulations.

This announcement is open June 30, 2005, although the selection maybe made in advance of that date.     Applicants should submit a cover letter, resume or OF-612 by e-mail to: tgray@ota.treas.gov or by mail to: U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Technical Assistance, Attn: Recruitment Coordinator, 740 15th Street, N. W., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20220.     Please reference Solicitation Number A05-007 on your cover letter, resume or OF-612.

<DESC>Synopsis The National Business Center (NBC) has a requirement for individual legal consulting services, under a Personnel Service Contract, to support its program of assistance within the international community. The NBC is acting as the designated representative for Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and is assisting in accomplishing mission objectives. The NBC will obtain required service through a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with qualified contractors. The NBC anticipates awarding a BPA with the best technically qualified contractors. To adequately meet its staffing needs, NBC will require highly technically qualified individuals working under a Personnel Service Contracts, to be contracted for a set period of time and will receive day-to-day instructions from appropriate staff members.  After this synopsis is issued, a solicitation notice will be issued inviting contractor (s) to offer submissions. The submissions will be evaluated by a Technical Proposal Evaluation Board (TPEC) to find the best technically qualified individuals. Those individuals, after being evaluated as having submitted a successful response, will enter into a formal agreement with the NBC. The Government contemplates award of a Basic Purchase Agreement (BPA) and will issue individual orders, for the required taskings. The proposed BPA will not contain a minimum quantity amount of work to be ordered. A BPA does not state or imply any agreement by the Government to place future calls or orders with the contractor or to be used in any manner that restricts competition. Orders will be issued on a firm-fixed-price basis. A BPA will be awarded to those individuals whose overall qualifications are the most advantageous to the Government.   The overall objective of this procurement is to secure legal services in support of MCC's program of assistance, including the review of program proposals received from MCC-eligible countries, the negotiation of Compacts (Compacts are defined as contractual agreements between MCC and the host nation to accomplish very specific Scopes of Work) and related agreements with such countries and the monitoring of programs funded under Compacts. A list of countries that are eligible for assistance can be found at http://www.mca.gov/countries/eligible/index.shtml Selected contractors will provide legal advice and assistance to NBC in support of MCC's assistance programs with eligible countries selected in accordance with MCC's authorizing legislation.  Legal consulting services will be provided in response to long-term and short-term task assignments, which shall be determined by NBC from time to time. Substantial experience in one or more of the following areas is required: assistance programs of donor governments and multi-lateral institutions for developing countries, intergovernmental agreements, and international business transactions in relevant countries.  Foreign language skills, especially French, Spanish and Portuguese, are desirable but not required.  As requested by NBC, selected contractors may work alone on particular tasks or may work as part of a team comprised of MCC staff and other contractors.   Tasks may involve one or more of the following activities: TASK I: Evaluate implementation and financial management plans TASK II:  Evaluate country procurement systems TASK III:  Support negotiation of Compacts and other agreements TASK IV:  Support oversight of program implementation TASK V:  Advise on development assistance legal, policy and operational issues   The Government will make an award to the responsible Offeror whose responsive proposal represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered, in accordance with the evaluation criteria below.  The best value tradeoff process described in FAR 15.101-1 permits tradeoffs among price and non-price factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal or the highest technically rated proposal.  The non-price factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price. Evaluation factors listed in descending order of importance: 1.  Technical Capability 2.  Past Performance 3.  Price/Hourly Rate  To be responsive the Offeror must address all the requirements of the solicitation and must include all information specifically required in all sections of the solicitation.

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  The National Airspace Systems Program Office, Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom Air Force Base, MA 01731, has a requirement to contract for the procurement of the following:  140 AN/GPN-30(ASR-11) terminal digital airport surveillance radars (DASR); engineering and technical support services for the conduct of site surveys, site designs, site construction, and existing radar dismantlement; system engineering support at specified Department of Defense (DoD) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) locations; and interim contractor logistics support.  This equipment and related support is to be ordered during FY08 – FY12.  The Government previously conducted a full and open competition for the acquisition of AN/GPN-30(ASR-11) radar systems, resulting in the award of a contract to the Raytheon Company.  Due to funding and programmatic issues, the DoD and FAA did not complete the entire acquisition of the originally planned and authorized system quantities within the original contract period of performance.  This contract action will allow the completion of the procurement of the originally competed system quantities.  The Government intends to contract with the Raytheon Company on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, as the supplies and services are available only from the original source and award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays to the Government.  See CBD Numbered Note 22.  This notice does not constitute a request for proposal, does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should this notice be construed as a commitment.  Contact the Contracting Officer Mr. Dale Pease,  tel: (781) 377-9024 e-mail: Dale.Pease@hanscom.af.mil or Ms. Gail Oliver, tel:(781) 377-9299 e-mail:Gail.Oliver@hanscom.af.mil with questions regarding this notice.  Interested subcontractors should contact Raytheon Company directly.

<DESC>A.  INTRODUCTION.

THIS IS AN ADVANCE NOTICE.  DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS PROVIDED TO GIVE INDUSTRY ADVANCE NOTICE OF AN ANTICIPATED BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT.

The High Power Microwaves High Power Systems Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Directed Energy Directorate, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, is seeking innovative techniques and approaches for the development of technologies, components, and systems for the High Power Microwave Technical Area and other directed energy systems via this Directed Energy Technology Applications and Research (DETAR) program.  The DETAR program intends to develop and enhance present capabilities as well as expand the horizons and search for new opportunities in all aspects of high power microwave (HPM) system and technology development.  The program will provide technology and applications research and development (R&D) for pulsed power (PP) and HPMs, making optimum use of AFRL/DEH capital resources, facilities, and experience.  This should include, but is not necessarily limited to, R&D on narrow band and wide band HPM loads; associated compact, portable pulsed power supplies suitable to drive such loads, including repetitive pulsed power supplies; alternative uses of such technology such as high energy particle beams; higher current and energy pulsed power and its applications, such as intense ionizing radiation sources, hypervelocity projectiles, material jets, and particulate beams; and other innovative developments of and use of pulsed power.

In making full use of capital assets located on Kirtland AFB, NM, the contractor is expected to provide R&D maintenance and management of several Kirtland AFB, NM facilities.  Sites and buildings housing these assets include the High Energy Plasma Laboratory (Building 322), The High Energy Microwave Laboratory (HEML, Building 323), the High Energy Research and Technology Facility (HERTF, Building 66071), portions of Sandia Area 4 used by AFRL/DE (Building 963), portions of buildings in the Building 900 complex, and a new facility located on KAFB housing operations presently conducted at Sandia Area IV. The pulse power systems contained in these facilities include modular capacitor systems capable of storing several mega joules, and delivering up to 20 megamps with flexible timing, and triggering of separate modules (e.g., SHIVA-STAR).   As part of this program, contractors will be expected to offer a significant and comprehensive facilities maintenance and operations program encompassing all operational, safety, and health aspects.

The estimated total program budget for these efforts is approximately $25-49.9M over five years (FY05: $5-9.5M; FY06: $5-10M; FY07: $5-9.5M; FY08: $5-10M; FY09: $5-10.9M), and the resulting contract will be awarded with a ceiling of $49.9M.  This amount is subject to adjustments that may be appropriate for the government to take full advantage of the contract ordering period.  AFRL reserves the right to make no award, a single award, or multiple awards.  This includes the possibility of making more than one award within a given topic area.  If multiple awards within a topic area do occur, contractors may have to compete with each other for a given task order.  If competed, AFRL will evaluate task order proposals on the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance:  technical merit, affordability, and previous performance on the contract.  AFRL then will evaluate, for realism and reasonableness, the cost proposal of the contractor selected for negotiation.

Technical Task Areas are described below.

1.  High Power Microwave Development:  

Preliminary results of the probability and effects testing and scenario modeling has indicated that HPM source power levels greater than 1 GW are of interest for the DETARDEHPM program, consistent with antenna gain and distance from target.  The thrust of this activity is to identify and explore new or novel sources and reassess existing sources capable of generating greater that 1 GW peak power and repetition rates in the 10s of hertz; execute an experimental research program that will fully test sources including fabrication and modification of test equipment and diagnostic equipment, and the evaluation and analysis of test results; downselect, design, fabricate and test the most likely candidate technologies based on modeling and experimental results; coordinate source development with pulse power and antenna development after the downselection process has occurred.   Heavy reliance on and coordination between this technical task area and the Theoretical and Computation R&D Technical Task Area 32 is expected.  A further aspect of this technical task area is to investigate, test, and fabricate antenna and antenna array concepts capable of adhering to volumetric requirements stemming from potential air vehicle concepts while obtaining sufficient gain to reach RF intensity goals on target at specified distances based on scenario development.  Consistent with reaching intensity goals is to explore the phenomenon of air breakdown at various altitudes and conditions, and to explore the physics associated with radiating multi-GW RF pulses in space including partially ionized sources in a vacuum and diffraction of antenna patterns by the upper atmosphere.  Work in this area may provide distinct, specialized products and fabrication techniques, unique diagnostics, and innovative methods to overcome air breakdown limits.   

2.   Theoretical and Computational R&D:

The objectives of this technical task area are to advance existing magneto-hydrodynamic codes and plasma modeling codes to verify HPM source concepts and various plasma application experiments.   Numerical analysis of such devices typically employs multidimensional (two and three dimensional) computational physics software of various types.  Examples include magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) software, such as Mach2 and Mach3, for dense plasma phenomena; particle-in-cell (PIC) software, such as ICEPIC, MAGIC and SOS, for collisionless charged particle phenomena; computational electromagnetics (CEM) software, such as PARANA and HFSS, for particle-free electromagnetic phenomena; and other software.  Research conducted by this modeling and simulation technical task area should explore the use of new materials, processes, and methods for improving the HPM source and subsystem performance characteristics, and efficiencies.

The task area also encompasses the theoretical and numerical analysis of systems from the prime mover to the radiating structures to demonstrate scientific and engineering feasibility and assess mission effectiveness.  A significant part of the research conducted in this technical task area is to gain further understanding of microwave effects on various electronic systems.  The objectives are to develop improved modeling and simulation capabilities for microwave effects on electronic systems, and evaluate various scenarios to predict microwave effectiveness in engagements.  The development of simulation tools capable of describing the microwave power pattern, electric field, and magnetic field powered by a pulse waveform is highly desired as well as improving codes used in modeling the interaction between an HPM signal and a "target."  These interactions include properly handling ground reflections, multi-path interference, side-lobe suppression techniques, scattering and standing waves, to ultimately determine field quantities at various points in the problem.  The DETAR program is interested in determining scaling laws for frequency, growth rate, and studies of competing instabilities.  

3.  Pulsed Power (PP) R&D:

The goal of this technical task area is to research and investigate new, innovative, or promising pulse power technologies, devices, and subsystems.  This will involve all aspects of pulse power R&D relevant to HPM and other AFRL/DE applications.  The work under this Technical Task Area includes hardware design, fabrication, assembly and test of components associated with multi- megajoule, greater than ten megamp, terawatt, ten microsecond systems.  Examples of pulse power devices and components include capacitors, inductors, fixed and dynamic (Electrically Exploded Fuse (EEF) and Explosively Formed Fuse (EFF)) resistors, transformers (air-core, ferrite-core, and partial-ferrite-core), over-volt and triggered switches (gas, vacuum, liquid metal, solid-state, and mechanical), insulators (gaseous, liquid, and solid-state), and diodes (vacuum and solid-state).  Examples of pulse power subsystems include capacitor banks, explosive magnetic flux compression generators (FCGs), Marx generators, pulse forming networks (PFNs), pulse forming lines (PFLs), and pulsed power loads. Pulse power loads of interest include vacuum and solid-state HPM sources, implosion devices for intense radiation production, magnetic field compression devices to accelerate charged particles, plasma and hypervelocity projectile accelerators, etc. Particular emphasis will be given to reducing system, subsystem, or component size, weight, efficiency, lifetime and cost, increasing performance, or improving reliability and robustness.  

4.  Pulsed Power Systems (PPS) R&D:

The goal of this technical task area is to explore the development of pulse power systems that drive HPM systems, charged particle beam systems, and other pulsed systems at required repetition rates and power levels, and ultimately to reach required volume and mass limits to achieve system requirements that may stem from the various technical task areas.   The scope of this effort includes designing, fabricating, testing, and integrating various pulse power technologies and prime power systems utilizing a systems engineering approach into a compact PPS driver(s) integrated to HPM source(s).  Examples of integrated PPS include single-shot flux compression generator-based inductive storage-pulse conditioning systems for narrow-band HPM tube loads, compact, rep-rated Marx-generator based systems for driving narrow-band or ultra-wide-band HPM sources, and conventional capacitor-bank systems with dynamic vacuum implosion loads.  Some research efforts are expected to be directed at continuous wave converters, oscillators, amplifiers, phased arrays, and wide-band generators.  Further efforts will be devoted towards modifying existing pulse power systems to accommodate new HPM or charged particle beam loads of various impedances.  Particle beam load drivers will be used to reliably achieve full current delivery to drive solid armature or solid liner implosion loads.  Some of these systems include the use of a main pulse driver with two or more auxiliary pulsed power discharges fired with controlled timing relative to the main discharge, with timing jitters as small as 20 nanoseconds.  Additional pulse power system work will include development of explosive magnetic flux compression generators that produce megamps to tens of megamps of current, and megajoules to tens of megajoules of magnetic energy, and the development of high current opening switches in the 10-20 megamp, 5 megajoule range with opening times less than 300 nanoseconds.  Pulse power systems work may include fielding remote experiment operations including the pulsed power system and load, fast photography, and radiation diagnostics.

This technical task area will explore fundamental research into the areas of hardware systems, subsystems, and diagnostic tools/hardware, which in turn will be used to test physical and/or engineering principles.  Diagnostics must be capable of measuring at least the current, voltage, and magnetic field in physical areas associated with experiments that produce hostile blast, debris, radiation fields and thermal environments.  Unique diagnostics include the ability to radiograph the types of experiments included in Technical Task Areas 3 and 4, including solid, armature, and solid liner implosion loads, with multiple radiographs at different, controlled times.  The timing jitters associated with radiography will of necessity be as small as 20 nanoseconds.  Research and experiments will be conducted with the goal of enhancing energy coupling efficiencies, increasing power (trillion watt range) delivered from a PPS driver to an output (experimental) load, mating advanced weapons concept devices to HPM generators, and develop hardware/techniques to characterize system performance.

5.  Prime Power:

The goal of this technical task area is to explore new, efficient, compact, low-mass, prime sources of power for pulse power systems.  This is an enabling technical task area and innovative solutions are sought to drive pulse power systems at desired repetition rates to achieve high average power levels over short pulse trains.  Areas of research for this technical task area includecover the design, development, modification, testing, and use of compact high-peak power limited lifetime devices, high voltage power supplies, compact transformers, motors, generators, batteries, thermal batteries, fuel cells, power conditioning, rotating machines, inverters, energy storage components, and the like.  A further area of investigation is expected to encompass the modification of existing equipment designed specifically for use in or with existing HPM, PP, PPS, and future compact PP system design.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Synergos Inc., 2202 Timberlock Place, Suite 230, The Woodlands, TX 77380 for the continued clinical trial management of two ongoing Phase I studies of SS1PE38.  The LMB uses genetics, molecular biology, cell biology, and molecular modeling to examine and solve a broad range of important biological problems.  In the Molecular Biology Section, one major program is directed at designing, producing, and testing new drugs (immunotoxins) to treat cancer.  In late 2002, the CRADA partners, who were running the SS1PE38 Phase I clinical trials terminated the CRADA and gave up the license for this drug.  At that time the license and the IND (Investigational New Drug document required by the FDA) was taken over by CTEP (Cancer Treatment Evaluation Program) at NCI.  In early 2003 a purchase order (263-MQ-309810) with Synergos, Inc was set up to assist in monitoring, project management, data management, statistical services, and regulatory support for the Phase I clinical trials on SS1PE38, which was developed in the LMB.   Due to difficulties in the recruitment of patients, coupled with the designs of the two clinical trial protocols themselves, there has been a delay in finishing the trials and additional clinical trial management is required from Synergos.  Synergos has possession of all the data from the patients treated by the original CRADA partners that NCI does not have the rights to.  In addition there are currently patients enrolled in these trials and any breaks in their treatment could be catastrophic.  The time to transfer all the information, and data files and bring a new company up to maximum operating levels would be very extensive and delay the completion of the Phase I trial jeopardizing the treatment of cancer patients.  Continuity and time constraints are crucial to the clinical trials and Synergos Inc., is the only known source. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EST (local Washington, D.C. time) on December 16, 2004.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 541614; Size Standard is 6 million.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE SOLICITATION FOR FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION TO ACQUIRE SERVICES ON A COST PLUS FIXED-FEE, PERFORMANCE BASED SERVICES. The anticipated date of award is 1 APR 2005 with a period of performance of 1 (one) year base period and 4 (four) years options periods.  INSCOM intends to issue a solicitation on or about 22 December 2004 for acquisition of contractor services.  The proposed acquisition is to acquire Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) and Management support fo r Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA), Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS), G-2, and the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM).  The contractor will be engaged in an environment that is focused on supporting the Armys and Intelligence Commu nitys (IC) transformation and Global War on Terrorism efforts. Consequently, the contractor must have knowledge and experience in military intelligence (both strategic and tactical) and supporting IT (e.g. communications, interoperability, and horizontal integration).  The results from these efforts will directly effect the Armys and the ICs support to the Warfighter.  The DCS, G-2 and INSCOM Chief Information Officer (CIO) have had to rely on contractor support to fulfill mission requirements.  As these requirements have expanded due to  War on Terrorism, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Army Transformation, the DCS, G-2  and INSCOM have continue to rely on the state-of-the-art advanced science and engineering expertise provided by contractor support.  Approximately 40% of the DCS, G-2 staff and 75% of the INSCOM CIO staff consist of contractor support, which has been inst rumental in their support to Army, DoD, and the Intelligence Community (IC).   The objective of this requirement is to obtain high quality services to assist in meeting G-2 and INSCOMs mission in transforming Army intelligence systems, processes, and culture to support a knowledge-based community via automation or human interface, i ntelligence information to the network and the ability to share that information.  The contractor shall provide technical support services that will be specified via task orders covering the following areas: Office Administration for DCS, G-2 Intelligence Community Information Management Directorate (DAMI-IM), Resource Integration Directorate (DAMI-RI), Management Services Directorate (DAMI-ZXM); Requirements and Studies Division for DCS, G-2 (DAMI-IM);  Information Assurance for DCS, G-2 (DAMI-IM);  Strategic Communications Division for DCS, G-2 (DAMI-IM); Networks Division for DCS, G-2 (DAMI-IM);  Counterintelligence Policy Update and Review for DCS, G-2 (DAMI-CD);  Integration and Plans Division for DCS, G-2 (DAMI-IM); WEB Development for INSCOM G3 and  INSCOM CIO Division.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for a noncommercial management support services for the Hunter Standoff Killer Team (HSKT) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) Operational Manger (OM), United States Forces Korea (USFK).  The US Army Aviation Applied T echnology Directorate, Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) has a requirement for operational program management support services.  This acquisition is to procure program management support services to the HSKT ACTD Ope rational Manger (OM), United States Forces Korea (USAK) in the planning, development and implementation of the Integrated Assessment Plan (IAP) and Joint Military Utilization Assessment (JMUA) of the HSKT ACTD.  The HSKT ACTD OM, currently in Korea, requir es in-CONUS liaison in order to coordinate the operational aspects of the HSKT ACTD with the HSKT Technical Manager (TM), the HSKT Transition Manager (XM) and other DoD organizations on a continuing basis.  In order to satisfy the HSKT ACTD OM liaison requ irement, the selected source must have personnel with requisite skills acquired through previous OM assignments associated with aviation related ACTDs.  The HSKT ACTD, as fast track acquisition program, is under a very time sensitive schedule.  Efficient e xecution of the program precludes ramp up or permitting time to develop the expertise to assume the duties of the HSKT OM in CONUS.  The support required for the HSKT OM will allow for the seamless integration and implementation of the Integrated Assessmen t Plan (IAP) and the Joint Military Utility Assessment (JMUA) planning with the technical activities of the HSKT ACTD.  Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) planning, Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTP)s development, and modeling and simulation are technical as well as operational activities that must be seamlessly integrated to support the HSKT operational concept, integrated into the IAP and validated by the successful HSKT demonstration in the JMUA. Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) intends to award a Labor Hour contract for twenty-one months with no options to Centurion Development Group, LLC.  This contractor is located in Chesapeake, Virginia and is a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Sma ll Business (SDVOSB).  This acquisition will be procured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (5), 15 U.S.C. 657f (Veterans Benefits Act of 2003), and FAR 6.302-5; authorized or required by statute.  This award is anticipated as a sole source contract, a responsible SDVOSB concern since there is not a reasonable expectation that two or more SDVOSB concerns will submit an offer.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to Centurion Development Group, LLC which is the only SDVOSB identified through market research as having the specific capability to perform the required support and directly relevant experience not only with ACTD management in general, but with the HSKT ACTD in particular.  Much of the informatio n that would be used to support this effort is historical data and is not available to other sources.  Centurion Development Group, LLC is deemed to be the only responsible source uniquely qualified to perform this program.  The period of performance for t his program is twenty-one months.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this effort is 541618.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source should be addressed to AATD, Attn:  AMSRD-AMR-AA -C (Ms. Pat Hagginbothom (757) 878-4818), Building 401 Lee Boulevard, Fort Eustis, VA 23604-5577.

<DESC>THE PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE DESRCIBED HEREIN HAS BEEN CANCELED DUE TO A CHANGE IN PROGRAM OFFICE REQUIREMENTS.  THE GOVERNMENT PLANS TO RE-EVALUATE THEIR REQUIREMENTS AND MAY PURSUE THE LINKLESS REQUIREMENT IN LATE FY05.

The U.S. Marine Corps has a requirement for an AH-1W Linkless Feed Program, which calls for replacing the current A/A49E-7 (V4) 20MM Turett System Linked Feed Assembly with one that utilizes the Linkless bulk 20MM ammunition that is common to other Department of Navy (DON) 20MM systems (F/A-18, CIWS).  The 20MM Linkless Feed modification will be installed in 181 aircraft and two trainers.  At a minimum, the new system should include replacement of the ammunition can, feed chutes, and replacement or  modification to the current feeder mechanism for the AH-1W A/A49E-7 (V4) 20MM Turret System.  Additionally, the modified/new system will stay within existing size, weight, and power restrictions without changes to the existing airframe.  Ammunition loading in austere locations/environments including Forward Arming and Refueling Point (FARP) and shipboard environments are required.  This change will be incorporated into and reused when the AH-1W is remanufactured into the AH-1Z.  Expected release of the Request For Proposal (RFP) will be in early September.  Once the RFP is issued, all responsible sources may submit a proposal. Once released in early September, the RFP can be located at:http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/.   In addition, the Government will allow those offerors interested in a Pre-Proposal Conference meeting to visit the Government’s facility at Patuxent River, MD to discuss the RFP after it has been released.  The time and date must be agreed upon by the Government and potential offeror and must be scheduled before the proposal due date to be established in the solicitation.   For those potential offerors interested in viewing the AH-1W aircraft, please contact the Contract Specialist to establish a time and date for the site visit.

<DESC>A.  INTRODUCTION.

THIS IS AN ADVANCE NOTICE.  DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS PROVIDED TO GIVE INDUSTRY ADVANCE NOTICE OF AN ANTICIPATED BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT.

The High Power Microwaves High Power Systems Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Directed Energy Directorate, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, is seeking innovative techniques and approaches for the development of technologies, components, and systems for High Power Microwave and other directed energy systems via this Directed Energy Technology Applications and Research (DETAR) program.  The DETAR program intends to develop and enhance present capabilities as well as expand the horizons and search for new opportunities in all aspects of high power microwave (HPM) system and technology development.  The program will provide technology and applications research and development (R&D) for pulsed power (PP) and HPMs, making optimum use of AFRL/DEH capital resources, facilities, and experience.  This should include, but is not necessarily limited to, R&D on narrow band and wide band HPM loads; associated compact, portable pulsed power supplies suitable to drive such loads, including repetitive pulsed power supplies; alternative uses of such technology such as high energy particle beams; higher current and energy pulsed power and its applications, such as intense ionizing radiation sources, hypervelocity projectiles, material jets, and particulate beams; and other innovative developments of and use of pulsed power.

In making full use of capital assets located on Kirtland AFB, NM, the contractor is expected to provide R&D maintenance and management of several Kirtland AFB, NM facilities.  Sites and buildings housing these assets include the High Energy Plasma Laboratory (Building 322), The High Energy Microwave Laboratory (HEML, Building 323), the High Energy Research and Technology Facility (HERTF, Building 66071), portions of Sandia Area 4 used by AFRL/DE (Building 963), portions of buildings in the Building 900 complex, and a new facility located on KAFB housing operations presently conducted at Sandia Area IV. The pulse power systems contained in these facilities include modular capacitor systems capable of storing several mega joules, and delivering up to 20 megamps with flexible timing, and triggering of separate modules (e.g., SHIVA-STAR).   As part of this program, contractors will be expected to offer a significant and comprehensive facilities maintenance and operations program encompassing all operational, safety, and health aspects.

The estimated total program budget for these efforts is approximately $25-49.9M over five years (FY05: $5-9.5M; FY06: $5-10M; FY07: $5-9.5M; FY08: $5-10M; FY09: $5-10.9M), and the resulting contract will be awarded with a ceiling of $49.9M.  This amount is subject to adjustments that may be appropriate for the government to take full advantage of the contract ordering period.  AFRL reserves the right to make no award, a single award, or multiple awards.  This includes the possibility of making more than one award within a given topic area.  If multiple awards within a topic area do occur, contractors may have to compete with each other for a given task order.  If competed, AFRL will evaluate task order proposals on the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance:  technical merit, affordability, and previous performance on the contract.  AFRL then will evaluate, for realism and reasonableness, the cost proposal of the contractor selected for negotiation.

A.  INTRODUCTION.

THIS IS AN ADVANCE NOTICE.  DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS PROVIDED TO GIVE INDUSTRY ADVANCE NOTICE OF AN ANTICIPATED BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT.

If competed, AFRL will evaluate task order proposals on the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance:  technical merit, affordability, and previous performance on the contract.  AFRL then will evaluate, for realism and reasonableness, the cost proposal of the contractor selected for negotiation.

Technical Task Areas are described below.

1.  High Power Microwave Development:  

Preliminary results of the probability and effects testing and scenario modeling has indicated that HPM source power levels greater than 1 GW are of interest for the DETAR program, consistent with antenna gain and distance ting sources capable of generating greater that 1 GW peak power and repetition rates in the 10s of hertz; execute an experimental research program that will fully test sources including fabrication and modification of test equipment and diagnostic equipment, and the evaluation and analysis of test results; downselect, design, fabricate and test the most likely candidate technologies based on modeling and experimental results; coordinate source development with pulse power and antenna development after the downselection process has occurred.   Heavy reliance on and coordination between this technical task area and the Theoretical and Computation R&D Technical Task Area 2 is expected.  A further aspect of this technical task area is to investigate, test, and fabricate antenna and antenna array concepts capable of adhering to volumetric requirements stemming from potential air vehicle concepts while obtaining sufficient gain to reach RF intensity goals on target at specified distances based on scenario development.  Consistent with reaching intensity goals is to explore the phenomenon of air breakdown at various altitudes and conditions, and to explore the physics associated with radiating multi-GW RF pulses in space including partially ionized sources in a vacuum and diffraction of antenna patterns by the upper atmosphere.  Work in this area may provide distinct, specialized products and fabrication techniques, unique diagnostics, and innovative methods to overcome air breakdown limits.   

2.   Theoretical and Computational R&D:

The objectives of this technical task area are to advance existing magneto-hydrodynamic codes and plasma modeling codes to verify HPM source concepts and various plasma application experiments.   Numerical analysis of such devices typically employs multidimensional (two and three dimensional) computational physics software of various types.  Examples include magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) software, such as Mach2 and Mach3, for dense plasma phenomena; particle-in-cell (PIC) software, such as ICEPIC, MAGIC and SOS, for collisionless charged particle phenomena; computational electromagnetics (CEM) software, such as PARANA and HFSS, for particle-free electromagnetic phenomena; and other software.  Research conducted by this modeling and simulation technical task area should explore the use of new materials, processes, and methods for improving the HPM source and subsystem performance characteristics, and efficiencies.

The task area also encompasses the theoretical and numerical analysis of systems from the prime mover to the radiating structures to demonstrate scientific and engineering feasibility and assess mission effectiveness.  A significant part of the research conducted in this technical task area is to gain further understanding of microwave effects on various electronic systems.  The objectives are to develop improved modeling and simulation capabilities for microwave effects on electronic systems, and evaluate various scenarios to predict microwave effectiveness in engagements.  The development of simulation tools capable of describing the microwave power pattern, electric field, and magnetic field powered by a pulse waveform is highly desired as well as improving codes used in modeling the interaction between a HPM signal and a "target."  These interactions include properly handling ground reflections, multi-path interference, side-lobe suppression techniques, scattering and standing waves, to ultimately determine field quantities at various points in the problem.  The DETAR program is interested in determining scaling laws for frequency, growth rate, and studies of competing instabilities.  

3.  Pulsed Power (PP) R&D:

The goal of this technical task area is to research and investigate new, innovative, or promising pulse power technologies, devices, and subsystems.  This will involve all aspects of pulse power R&D relevant to HPM and other AFRL/DE applications.  The work under this Technical Task Area includes hardware design, fabrication, assembly and test of components associated with multi- megajoule, greater than ten megamp, terawatt, ten microsecond systems.  Examples of pulse power devices and components include capacitors, inductors, fixed and dynamic (Electrically Exploded Fuse (EEF) and Explosively Formed Fuse (EFF)) resistors, transformers (air-core, ferrite-core, and partial-ferrite-core), over-volt and triggered switches (gas, vacuum, liquid metal, solid-state, and mechanical), insulators (gaseous, liquid, and solid-state), and diodes (vacuum and solid-state).  Examples of pulse power subsystems include capacitor banks, explosive magnetic flux compression generators (FCGs), Marx generators, pulse forming networks (PFNs), pulse forming lines (PFLs), and pulsed power loads. Pulse power loads of interest include vacuum and solid-state HPM sources, implosion devices for intense radiation production, magnetic field compression devices to accelerate charged particles, plasma and hypervelocity projectile accelerators, etc. Particular emphasis will be given to reducing system, subsystem, or component size, weight, efficiency, lifetime and cost, increasing performance, or improving reliability and robustness.  

4.  Pulsed Power Systems (PPS) R&D:

The goal of this technical task area is to explore the development of pulse power systems that drive HPM systems, charged particle beam systems, and other pulsed systems at required repetition rates and power levels, and ultimately to reach required volume and mass limits to achieve system requirements that may stem from the various technical task areas.   The scope of this effort includes designing, fabricating, testing, and integrating various pulse power technologies and prime power systems utilizing a systems engineering approach into a compact PPS driver(s) integrated to HPM source(s).  Examples of integrated PPS include single-shot flux compression generator-based inductive storage-pulse conditioning systems for narrow-band HPM tube loads, compact, rep-rated Marx-generator based systems for driving narrow-band or ultra-wide-band HPM sources, and conventional capacitor-bank systems with dynamic vacuum implosion loads.  Some research efforts are expected to be directed at continuous wave converters, oscillators, amplifiers, phased arrays, and wide-band generators.  Further efforts will be devoted towards modifying existing pulse power systems to accommodate new HPM or charged particle beam loads of various impedances.  Particle beam load drivers will be used to reliably achieve full current delivery to drive solid armature or solid liner implosion loads.  Some of these systems include the use of a main pulse driver with two or more auxiliary pulsed power discharges fired with controlled timing relative to the main discharge, with timing jitters as small as 20 nanoseconds.  Additional pulse power system work will include development of explosive magnetic flux compression generators that produce megamps to tens of megamps of current, and megajoules to tens of megajoules of magnetic energy, and the development of high current opening switches in the 10-20 megamp, 5 megajoule range with opening times less than 300 nanoseconds.  Pulse power systems work may include fielding remote experiment operations including the pulsed power system and load, fast photography, and radiation diagnostics.

This technical task area will explore fundamental research into the areas of hardware systems, subsystems, and diagnostic tools/hardware, which in turn will be used to test physical and/or engineering principles.  Diagnostics must be capable of measuring at least the current, voltage, and magnetic field in physical areas associated with experiments that produce hostile blast, debris, radiation fields and thermal environments.  Unique diagnostics include the ability to radiograph the types of experiments included in Technical Task Areas 3 and 4, including solid, armature, and solid liner implosion loads, with multiple radiographs at different, controlled times.  The timing jitters associated with radiography will of necessity be as small as 20 nanoseconds.  Research and experiments will be conducted with the goal of enhancing energy coupling efficiencies, increasing power (trillion watt range) delivered from a PPS driver to an output (experimental) load, mating advanced weapons concept devices to HPM generators, and develop hardware/techniques to characterize system performance.

5.  Prime Power:

The goal of this technical task area is to explore new, efficient, compact, low-mass, prime sources of power for pulse power systems.  This is an enabling technical task area and innovative solutions are sought to drive pulse power systems at desired repetition rates to achieve high average power levels over short pulse trains.  Areas of research for this technical task area include the design, development, modification, testing, and use of compact high-peak power limited lifetime devices, high voltage power supplies, compact transformers, motors, generators, batteries, thermal batteries, fuel cells, power conditioning, rotating machines, inverters, energy storage components, and the like.  A further area of investigation is expected to encompass the modification of existing equipment designed specifically for use in or with existing HPM, PP, PPS, and future compact PP system design.

B.  GENERAL INFORMATION.
The government anticipates awarding an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee Task Order, completion contract(s) but reserves the right to award a procurement instrument best suited to the nature of the research proposal.  The contract award is anticipated to be unclassified, and is expected to have a five-year ordering period.  In the event the government is unable to conclude negotiations with the apparent successful offeror, the government reserves the right to conduct negotiations with another offeror.

Page 7 of 8 insert the following after the first paragraph.

If the offeror chooses to submit their proposal response to any and or all of the five technical areas but not submit a cost proposal for the task order(s) (0001, 0002, sample task order) the technical page limitation will be as follows:

Executive Summary shall not exceed 2 pages

from target.  The thrust of this activity is to identify and explore new or novel sources and reassess existing sources capable of generating greater that 1 GW peak power and repetition rates in the 10s of hertz; execute an experimental research program that will fully test sources including fabrication and modification of test equipment and diagnostic equipment, and the evaluation and analysis of test results; downselect, design, fabricate and test the most likely candidate technologies based on modeling and experimental results; coordinate source development with pulse power and antenna development after the downselection process has occurred.   Heavy reliance on and coordination between this technical task area and the Theoretical and Computation R&D Technical Task Area 2 is expected.  A further aspect of this technical task area is to investigate, test, and fabricate antenna and antenna array concepts capable of adhering to volumetric requirements stemming from potential air vehicle concepts while obtaining sufficient gain to reach RF intensity goals on target at specified distances based on scenario development.  Consistent with reaching intensity goals is to explore the phenomenon of air breakdown at various altitudes and conditions, and to explore the physics associated with radiating multi-GW RF pulses in space including partially ionized sources in a vacuum and diffraction of antenna patterns by the upper atmosphere.  Work in this area may provide distinct, specialized products and fabrication techniques, unique diagnostics, and innovative methods to overcome air breakdown limits.   

2.   Theoretical and Computational R&D:

The objectives of this technical task area are to advance existing magneto-hydrodynamic codes and plasma modeling codes to verify HPM source concepts and various plasma application experiments.   Numerical analysis of such devices typically employs multidimensional (two and three dimensional) computational physics software of various types.  Examples include magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) software, such as Mach2 and Mach3, for dense plasma phenomena; particle-in-cell (PIC) software, such as ICEPIC, MAGIC and SOS, for collisionless charged particle phenomena; computational electromagnetics (CEM) software, such as PARANA and HFSS, for particle-free electromagnetic phenomena; and other software.  Research conducted by this modeling and simulation technical task area should explore the use of new materials, processes, and methods for improving the HPM source and subsystem performance characteristics, and efficiencies.

The task area also encompasses the theoretical and numerical analysis of systems from the prime mover to the radiating structures to demonstrate scientific and engineering feasibility and assess mission effectiveness.  A significant part of the research conducted in this technical task area is to gain further understanding of microwave effects on various electronic systems.  The objectives are to develop improved modeling and simulation capabilities for microwave effects on electronic systems, and evaluate various scenarios to predict microwave effectiveness in engagements.  The development of simulation tools capable of describing the microwave power pattern, electric field, and magnetic field powered by a pulse waveform is highly desired as well as improving codes used in modeling the interaction between a HPM signal and a "target."  These interactions include properly handling ground reflections, multi-path interference, side-lobe suppression techniques, scattering and standing waves, to ultimately determine field quantities at various points in the problem.  The DETAR program is interested in determining scaling laws for frequency, growth rate, and studies of competing instabilities.  

3.  Pulsed Power (PP) R&D:

The goal of this technical task area is to research and investigate new, innovative, or promising pulse power technologies, devices, and subsystems.  This will involve all aspects of pulse power R&D relevant to HPM and other AFRL/DE applications.  The work under this Technical Task Area includes hardware design, fabrication, assembly and test of components associated with multi- megajoule, greater than ten megamp, terawatt, ten microsecond systems.  Examples of pulse power devices and components include capacitors, inductors, fixed and dynamic (Electrically Exploded Fuse (EEF) and Explosively Formed Fuse (EFF)) resistors, transformers (air-core, ferrite-core, and partial-ferrite-core), over-volt and triggered switches (gas, vacuum, liquid metal, solid-state, and mechanical), insulators (gaseous, liquid, and solid-state), and diodes (vacuum and solid-state).  Examples of pulse power subsystems include capacitor banks, explosive magnetic flux compression generators (FCGs), Marx generators, pulse forming networks (PFNs), pulse forming lines (PFLs), and pulsed power loads. Pulse power loads of interest include vacuum and solid-state HPM sources, implosion devices for intense radiation production, magnetic field compression devices to accelerate charged particles, plasma and hypervelocity projectile accelerators, etc. Particular emphasis will be given to reducing system, subsystem, or component size, weight, efficiency, lifetime and cost, increasing performance, or improving reliability and robustness.  

4.  Pulsed Power Systems (PPS) R&D:

The goal of this technical task area is to explore the development of pulse power systems that drive HPM systems, charged particle beam systems, and other pulsed systems at required repetition rates and power levels, and ultimately to reach required volume and mass limits to achieve system requirements that may stem from the various technical task areas.   The scope of this effort includes designing, fabricating, testing, and integrating various pulse power technologies and prime power systems utilizing a systems engineering approach into a compact PPS driver(s) integrated to HPM source(s).  Examples of integrated PPS include single-shot flux compression generator-based inductive storage-pulse conditioning systems for narrow-band HPM tube loads, compact, rep-rated Marx-generator based systems for driving narrow-band or ultra-wide-band HPM sources, and conventional capacitor-bank systems with dynamic vacuum implosion loads.  Some research efforts are expected to be directed at continuous wave converters, oscillators, amplifiers, phased arrays, and wide-band generators.  Further efforts will be devoted towards modifying existing pulse power systems to accommodate new HPM or charged particle beam loads of various impedances.  Particle beam load drivers will be used to reliably achieve full current delivery to drive solid armature or solid liner implosion loads.  Some of these systems include the use of a main pulse driver with two or more auxiliary pulsed power discharges fired with controlled timing relative to the main discharge, with timing jitters as small as 20 nanoseconds.  Additional pulse power system work will include development of explosive magnetic flux compression generators that produce megamps to tens of megamps of current, and megajoules to tens of megajoules of magnetic energy, and the development of high current opening switches in the 10-20 megamp, 5 megajoule range with opening times less than 300 nanoseconds.  Pulse power systems work may include fielding remote experiment operations including the pulsed power system and load, fast photography, and radiation diagnostics.

This technical task area will explore fundamental research into the areas of hardware systems, subsystems, and diagnostic tools/hardware, which in turn will be used to test physical and/or engineering principles.  Diagnostics must be capable of measuring at least the current, voltage, and magnetic field in physical areas associated with experiments that produce hostile blast, debris, radiation fields and thermal environments.  Unique diagnostics include the ability to radiograph the types of experiments included in Technical Task Areas 3 and 4, including solid, armature, and solid liner implosion loads, with multiple radiographs at different, controlled times.  The timing jitters associated with radiography will of necessity be as small as 20 nanoseconds.  Research and experiments will be conducted with the goal of enhancing energy coupling efficiencies, increasing power (trillion watt range) delivered from a PPS driver to an output (experimental) load, mating advanced weapons concept devices to HPM generators, and develop hardware/techniques to characterize system performance.

5.  Prime Power:

The goal of this technical task area is to explore new, efficient, compact, low-mass, prime sources of power for pulse power systems.  This is an enabling technical task area and innovative solutions are sought to drive pulse power systems at desired repetition rates to achieve high average power levels over short pulse trains.  Areas of research for this technical task area include the design, development, modification, testing, and use of compact high-peak power limited lifetime devices, high voltage power supplies, compact transformers, motors, generators, batteries, thermal batteries, fuel cells, power conditioning, rotating machines, inverters, energy storage components, and the like.  A further area of investigation is expected to encompass the modification of existing equipment designed specifically for use in or with existing HPM, PP, PPS, and future compact PP system design.

A.  INTRODUCTION.

THIS IS AN ADVANCE NOTICE.  DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS PROVIDED TO GIVE INDUSTRY ADVANCE NOTICE OF AN ANTICIPATED BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT.

The High Power Microwaves High Power Systems Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Directed Energy Directorate, Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, is seeking innovative techniques and approaches for the development of technologies, components, and systems for High Power Microwave and other directed energy systems via this Directed Energy Technology Applications and Research (DETAR) program.  The DETAR program intends to develop and enhance present capabilities as well as expand the horizons and search for new opportunities in all aspects of high power microwave (HPM) system and technology development.  The program will provide technology and applications research and development (R&D) for pulsed power (PP) and HPMs, making optimum use of AFRL/DEH capital resources, facilities, and experience.  This should include, but is not necessarily limited to, R&D on narrow band and wide band HPM loads; associated compact, portable pulsed power supplies suitable to drive such loads, including repetitive pulsed power supplies; alternative uses of such technology such as high energy particle beams; higher current and energy pulsed power and its applications, such as intense ionizing radiation sources, hypervelocity projectiles, material jets, and particulate beams; and other innovative developments of and use of pulsed power.

In making full use of capital assets located on Kirtland AFB, NM, the contractor is expected to provide R&D maintenance and management of several Kirtland AFB, NM facilities.  Sites and buildings housing these assets include the High Energy Plasma Laboratory (Building 322), The High Energy Microwave Laboratory (HEML, Building 323), the High Energy Research and Technology Facility (HERTF, Building 66071), portions of Sandia Area 4 used by AFRL/DE (Building 963), portions of buildings in the Building 900 complex, and a new facility located on KAFB housing operations presently conducted at Sandia Area IV. The pulse power systems contained in these facilities include modular capacitor systems capable of storing several mega joules, and delivering up to 20 megamps with flexible timing, and triggering of separate modules (e.g., SHIVA-STAR).   As part of this program, contractors will be expected to offer a significant and comprehensive facilities maintenance and operations program encompassing all operational, safety, and health aspects.

The estimated total program budget for these efforts is approximately $25-49.9M over five years (FY05: $5-9.5M; FY06: $5-10M; FY07: $5-9.5M; FY08: $5-10M; FY09: $5-10.9M), and the resulting contract will be awarded with a ceiling of $49.9M.  This amount is subject to adjustments that may be appropriate for the government to take full advantage of the contract ordering period.  AFRL reserves the right to make no award, a single award, or multiple awards.  This includes the possibility of making more than one award within a given topic area.  If multiple awards within a topic area do occur, contractors may have to compete with each other for a given task order.  If competed, AFRL will evaluate task order proposals on the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance:  technical merit, affordability, and previous performance on the contract.  AFRL then will evaluate, for realism and reasonableness, the cost proposal of the contractor selected for negotiation.

Technical Task Areas are described below.

1.  High Power Microwave Development:  

Preliminary results of the probability and effects testing and scenario modeling has indicated that HPM source power levels greater than 1 GW are of interest for the DETAR program, consistent with antenna gain and distance from target.  The thrust of this activity is to identify and explore new or novel sources and reassess existing sources capable of generating greater that 1 GW peak power and repetition rates in the 10s of hertz; execute an experimental research program that will fully test sources including fabrication and modification of test equipment and diagnostic equipment, and the evaluation and analysis of test results; downselect, design, fabricate and test the most likely candidate technologies based on modeling and experimental results; coordinate source development with pulse power and antenna development after the downselection process has occurred.   Heavy reliance on and coordination between this technical task area and the Theoretical and Computation R&D Technical Task Area 2 is expected.  A further aspect of this technical task area is to investigate, test, and fabricate antenna and antenna array concepts capable of adhering to volumetric requirements stemming from potential air vehicle concepts while obtaining sufficient gain to reach RF intensity goals on target at specified distances based on scenario development.  Consistent with reaching intensity goals is to explore the phenomenon of air breakdown at various altitudes and conditions, and to explore the physics associated with radiating multi-GW RF pulses in space including partially ionized sources in a vacuum and diffraction of antenna patterns by the upper atmosphere.  Work in this area may provide distinct, specialized products and fabrication techniques, unique diagnostics, and innovative methods to overcome air breakdown limits.   

2.   Theoretical and Computational R&D:

The objectives of this technical task area are to advance existing magneto-hydrodynamic codes and plasma modeling codes to verify HPM source concepts and various plasma application experiments.   Numerical analysis of such devices typically employs multidimensional (two and three dimensional) computational physics software of various types.  Examples include magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) software, such as Mach2 and Mach3, for dense plasma phenomena; particle-in-cell (PIC) software, such as ICEPIC, MAGIC and SOS, for collisionless charged particle phenomena; computational electromagnetics (CEM) software, such as PARANA and HFSS, for particle-free electromagnetic phenomena; and other software.  Research conducted by this modeling and simulation technical task area should explore the use of new materials, processes, and methods for improving the HPM source and subsystem performance characteristics, and efficiencies.

The task area also encompasses the theoretical and numerical analysis of systems from the prime mover to the radiating structures to demonstrate scientific and engineering feasibility and assess mission effectiveness.  A significant part of the research conducted in this technical task area is to gain further understanding of microwave effects on various electronic systems.  The objectives are to develop improved modeling and simulation capabilities for microwave effects on electronic systems, and evaluate various scenarios to predict microwave effectiveness in engagements.  The development of simulation tools capable of describing the microwave power pattern, electric field, and magnetic field powered by a pulse waveform is highly desired as well as improving codes used in modeling the interaction between a HPM signal and a "target."  These interactions include properly handling ground reflections, multi-path interference, side-lobe suppression techniques, scattering and standing waves, to ultimately determine field quantities at various points in the problem.  The DETAR program is interested in determining scaling laws for frequency, growth rate, and studies of competing instabilities.  

3.  Pulsed Power (PP) R&D:

The goal of this technical task area is to research and investigate new, innovative, or promising pulse power technologies, devices, and subsystems.  This will involve all aspects of pulse power R&D relevant to HPM and other AFRL/DE applications.  The work under this Technical Task Area includes hardware design, fabrication, assembly and test of components associated with multi- megajoule, greater than ten megamp, terawatt, ten microsecond systems.  Examples of pulse power devices and components include capacitors, inductors, fixed and dynamic (Electrically Exploded Fuse (EEF) and Explosively Formed Fuse (EFF)) resistors, transformers (air-core, ferrite-core, and partial-ferrite-core), over-volt and triggered switches (gas, vacuum, liquid metal, solid-state, and mechanical), insulators (gaseous, liquid, and solid-state), and diodes (vacuum and solid-state).  Examples of pulse power subsystems include capacitor banks, explosive magnetic flux compression generators (FCGs), Marx generators, pulse forming networks (PFNs), pulse forming lines (PFLs), and pulsed power loads. Pulse power loads of interest include vacuum and solid-state HPM sources, implosion devices for intense radiation production, magnetic field compression devices to accelerate charged particles, plasma and hypervelocity projectile accelerators, etc. Particular emphasis will be given to reducing system, subsystem, or component size, weight, efficiency, lifetime and cost, increasing performance, or improving reliability and robustness.  

4.  Pulsed Power Systems (PPS) R&D:

The goal of this technical task area is to explore the development of pulse power systems that drive HPM systems, charged particle beam systems, and other pulsed systems at required repetition rates and power levels, and ultimately to reach required volume and mass limits to achieve system requirements that may stem from the various technical task areas.   The scope of this effort includes designing, fabricating, testing, and integrating various pulse power technologies and prime power systems utilizing a systems engineering approach into a compact PPS driver(s) integrated to HPM source(s).  Examples of integrated PPS include single-shot flux compression generator-based inductive storage-pulse conditioning systems for narrow-band HPM tube loads, compact, rep-rated Marx-generator based systems for driving narrow-band or ultra-wide-band HPM sources, and conventional capacitor-bank systems with dynamic vacuum implosion loads.  Some research efforts are expected to be directed at continuous wave converters, oscillators, amplifiers, phased arrays, and wide-band generators.  Further efforts will be devoted towards modifying existing pulse power systems to accommodate new HPM or charged particle beam loads of various impedances.  Particle beam load drivers will be used to reliably achieve full current delivery to drive solid armature or solid liner implosion loads.  Some of these systems include the use of a main pulse driver with two or more auxiliary pulsed power discharges fired with controlled timing relative to the main discharge, with timing jitters as small as 20 nanoseconds.  Additional pulse power system work will include development of explosive magnetic flux compression generators that produce megamps to tens of megamps of current, and megajoules to tens of megajoules of magnetic energy, and the development of high current opening switches in the 10-20 megamp, 5 megajoule range with opening times less than 300 nanoseconds.  Pulse power systems work may include fielding remote experiment operations including the pulsed power system and load, fast photography, and radiation diagnostics.

This technical task area will explore fundamental research into the areas of hardware systems, subsystems, and diagnostic tools/hardware, which in turn will be used to test physical and/or engineering principles.  Diagnostics must be capable of measuring at least the current, voltage, and magnetic field in physical areas associated with experiments that produce hostile blast, debris, radiation fields and thermal environments.  Unique diagnostics include the ability to radiograph the types of experiments included in Technical Task Areas 3 and 4, including solid, armature, and solid liner implosion loads, with multiple radiographs at different, controlled times.  The timing jitters associated with radiography will of necessity be as small as 20 nanoseconds.  Research and experiments will be conducted with the goal of enhancing energy coupling efficiencies, increasing power (trillion watt range) delivered from a PPS driver to an output (experimental) load, mating advanced weapons concept devices to HPM generators, and develop hardware/techniques to characterize system performance.

5.  Prime Power:

The goal of this technical task area is to explore new, efficient, compact, low-mass, prime sources of power for pulse power systems.  This is an enabling technical task area and innovative solutions are sought to drive pulse power systems at desired repetition rates to achieve high average power levels over short pulse trains.  Areas of research for this technical task area include the design, development, modification, testing, and use of compact high-peak power limited lifetime devices, high voltage power supplies, compact transformers, motors, generators, batteries, thermal batteries, fuel cells, power conditioning, rotating machines, inverters, energy storage components, and the like.  A further area of investigation is expected to encompass the modification of existing equipment designed specifically for use in or with existing HPM, PP, PPS, and future compact PP system design.

POC:  Marcia Goldman, Contract Specialist (301) 496-2302 
DESC:  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical and customer service capabilities of small businesses interested in providing dosimetry services to NIH. NIH possesses a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license authorizing its use of radioactive materials that includes requirements for performing routine monitoring for external occupational exposure, notification of individuals and their supervisors when exposures approach maximum permissible limits, and making recommendations for remedial action whenever appropriate.  Independently, and not as an agent of the Government (the Customer), the Contractor shall furnish the personnel, labor, facilities, equipment, parts, materials, and supplies necessary to provide a comprehensive external exposure monitoring program, including associated services, in accordance with the requirements of the NIH license.  Through the Division of Radiation Safety (DRS), the Office of Research Services (ORS) provides radiation exposure monitoring services to NIH employees who utilize radioactive materials and radiation producing equipment in the course of their research.  The ORS is seeking organizations that can provide state of the art dosimetry equipment, timely reading and reporting of the monitoring results, and a comprehensive, interactive database from which historical and regulatory data may be readily obtained.  The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS Code 541380 size standard  6.0 million.  The ORS intends to award a new contract to the dosimetry provider whose services most adequately support the programs and the needs of the NIH.  Services that will be required by this procurement will include, but are not limited to, the furnishing of all personnel, labor, facilities, equipment, parts, materials, and supplies considered essential for providing all specified types of personal and environmental dosimeters, including dosimeter calibration, monitoring, and necessary associated services in accordance with NIH requirements.  These requirements shall include maintaining a Certificate of Accreditation from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) through its National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) for all test categories applicable to whole body, extremity, and environmental dosimeters.  Additional requirements include the ability to utilize existing NIH methodology for record keeping and identification of employees and lab groups, permitting direct computer access to personnel monitoring database(s) by DRS personnel, participation in a joint QA/QC program as directed by the DRS, and providing dosimetry equipment that is hermetically sealed such that it permits gas and/or liquid wash sterilization while guarding against damage from water and laboratory chemicals.  Additionally, qualified businesses should demonstrate a propensity for the development and incorporation of innovative and efficiency-improving systems, products, and customer service into their proposed dosimetry service.   An example would be the availability of operational or electronic dosimeter systems that allow for on-site management of personnel exposures.  Experience in managing similar dosimetry service contracts must be demonstrated. This market survey is being conducted through the CBD to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information. Responding firms should provide two (2) copies of their capability statement to the Office of Procurement Management at the address provided not later than January 31, 2005.. Please send to the attention of Marcia Goldman, 6011 Executive Blvd., Room 539A, Bethesda, Maryland  20892-7663



Basic Services:
 
1.  Whole Body Dosimeters:  Whole body monitoring systems will preferably use optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) or an equivalent technology.  The ideal system involves the use of a single monitor capable of detecting beta, gamma, and neutron radiations.  The monitor must be designed for "clip-on" attachment to a worker's clothing for use under normal conditions, but should also be versatile enough to be adaptable to other monitoring situations such as extremity-wrist, lens of eye, or area monitoring if required.

<RESPDATE>121404
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Dennis J Walp, Contract Specialist,  843-218-5978
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Charleston (SSCC), Code 50 is tasked to procure, deliver and install high frequency (HF) radio communications equipment for the Federal Emergency Management Authority (FEMA).  This contract shall provide systems meeting all requirements specified in the solicitation. The FEMA National Radio System (FNARS) is a HF radio network which provides essential emergency communications capabilities between federal, state, and local governments during emergencies or disasters.  This system is regarded as a ?first responder? communications mechanism which may be used to maintain reliable long and short range radio communications with affected disaster areas without dependence upon more susceptible commercial terrestrial and satellite telecommunications networks. The FNARS upgrade will utilize Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) capability in accordance with MIL-STD-188.141B (2G) and frequency shift keying (FSK) capability in accordance with MIL-STD-188-110B. MIL-STD-188-141C (3G) ALE capability will be installed upon third generation availability. The FNARS HF system will be utilized to transmit and receive secure and non-secure voice and data. Data shall include, but not limited to, e-mail, text messages and images. Data rate requirements are expected to be range between 9,600 and 19,200 bauds per second (BPS). A typical FNARS system will include operator consoles, HF radio transmission and reception equipment, RF matrices and antennas.  A FEMA Ethernet switch and router will provide Network Control Center (NECOS), Federal Regional Center (FRC) and Regional Office (RO) system connectivity to the FEMA Wide Area Network (WAN) and will permit remote operation and control of these networked HF radio systems by NECOS, FRC or RO locations.  Remote control and operation of HF radio systems will be accomplished using networked desktop or laptop computers. State Emergency Operations Center (EOC) HF radio equipment will not be connected to the FEMA WAN initially but will require local area network (LAN) remote operation and control.  However, EOC radio equipment installations must be accomplished with the understanding that FEMA WAN connections may be required at some later date. Split-site HF systems may be required at some locations.  In these cases, the transmitter and receiver will not be co-located.  Therefore, for effective ALE operation, it will be necessary that the receiver and exciter be capable of remotely communicating with and controlling one another.  In many cases a co-located transmitter and receiver (transceiver) will be required due to lack of funding or installation real estate for HF equipment and/or associated antennas. Ideally each FNARS installation will have a two (or multi-) radio configuration.  One HF system would be utilized for voice communications and another HF system would be utilized for email and messaging communications.  This configuration would permit the exchange of both voice and data without interruption to either communications medium.  However, if a two radio installation is not possible due to either a lack of funding or real estate, an interface to preempt data traffic by higher priority voice traffic will be required. The HF radio equipment will include a Receiver/Exciter (for both combined and split systems), Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) and Link Quality Analysis (LQA), and will be adaptable to future Electronic Counter-Counter Measures (ECCM) waveforms.  The systems will conform to Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), MIL-STD-188.110B and STANAG 5066.  The equipment will include the ability to process 39 tone HF waveforms to ensure backward compatibility and current mission interoperability.  The transmitter subsystems will be configured with 400W (or 500W), 1kW, and 4kW power amplification, depending upon station location, propagation requirements, network interoperability requirements, and special operations.  The exact configuration will be determined by site survey, and network configuration. The 400/500W and 1kW systems must be contained in a single standard 72 inch high 19 inch wide rack but the 4kW systems may consist of two racks. At the Network Control Station (NECOS), FRC?s and RO?s, FNARS will use a modular, open system design to automatically operate and remotely control networked HF transmitter and receiver resources. This will include NECOS, FRC and RO systems at split site stations.  To achieve maximum flexibility the FNARS will use commercially available standards based operations, control and communications software and a multi-tasking operating system.  This will allow the station to operate ?lights out? (unmanned) and to be economically controlled from a central location if necessary. It is a requirement that the HF radio equipment be capable of operating with KY-99A, KY-100, VP-116, DTD (AN/CYZ-10), and KIV-7 HSB communications security (COMSEC) equipment. The HF radio equipment manufacturer must also be capable of providing responsive technical support on site or via telephone on an ?as needed? basis to either FEMA or SPAWAR Systems Center Charleston personnel.  The radios will available for use based on 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Technical support may be required at any time during the availability. The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, Firm -Fixed -Price (FFP) type contract. Period of performance will be one base year with four one-year options. The approximate value of the contract will be $28,000,000.00. Place of delivery will be to Government sites as directed by individual delivery orders. SEE NOTE 22

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair nd timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

S. COAST GUARD HU-25 OXYGEN MASK REPAIR/OVERHAUL, STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES1.0BACKGROUND:
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault Aviation, previously, Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate in salt laden environments.   EROS Full Face Quick Donning Oxygen Masks, P/N MF10-03-02, manufactured by GIE-EROS, Plaisir, France, which were installed in these aircraft in 1991 and serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking provides a historical record of repair, overhaul, maintenance, and item location and status. 2.0OBJECTIVE:  2.1.    The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain the services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to effectively repair and overhaul (as defined in paragraph 2) and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 oxygen masks.  Repaired/overhauled oxygen masks must meet the OEM’s specifications and be In - Accordance With (IAW) Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) 35-13-61, REV 2,dated 01/31/2003 and Coast Guard Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) HU-25         935030.0, dated 08/01/1992.  The Coast Guard has placed all oxygen mask parts, with the exception of Regulator Assembly, P/N RMC 1007-4, on condition to be replaced as necessary.  The Regulator Assembly, P/N RMC1007-4, requires overhaul every six (6)years.  GIE-EROS, Plaisir, France is the OEM.  The Coast Guard anticipates two (2) levels of repair.  First, a “return to service” is considered as test/inspect/repair as necessary.  This work consists of inspection, failure analysis, defective part(s) replacement (i.e., Harness Assy., Microphone Assy., Hose Supply Assy., and Mask Assy.) if necessary, and testing to meet the OEM’s functional return to service requirements (component time continues).  Secondly, an  overhaul is considered over and above the repair scope and includes overhaul of the regulator assembly and the replacement of additional parts as necessary.  An overhaul zeroes the Time Since Overhaul (TSO).  In addition the offeror shall install OEM Dust Cover P/N 59447-00 to Hose Assembly P/N DTS series for both repair and overhaul.  The offeror shall provide a cost breakdown for parts and labor.  At a minimum, these two(2) levels of service should be addressed in the offeror’s technical and cost proposal.    Offerors may propose additional levels of service.  The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform the services requested.   This includes, but is not limited to, required tooling, manuals, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, preservation, packaging, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul the oxygen masks.   The offeror’s responsibilities to the Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that all OEM Service Bulletins and Coast Guard TCTOs remain incorporated upon completion of work. Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.  The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (ARSC) HU-25 Product Line and the winning offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.  2.2.  To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria:   2.2.1.  Technical
2.2.1.1  Provide a detailed work specification for oxygen mask return to service and overhaul.  2.2.1.2. Provide a written Performance Metrics Plan..  2.2.1.3. Provide evidence of and ability to maintain a Quality System. 2.2.1.4.	Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling to meet the OEM’s specifications listed in paragraph 2.  2.2.1.5. Provide separate cost breakdowns inclusive of parts and labor for each level of service.  2.2.2. Past Performance  2.2.2.1. Provide documentation of having performed repair and overhaul of similar or like items.   2.2.2.2.  Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation over the past two (2) years on the servicing of similar or like items.  Include references’ name, company, phone number, and e-mail address.  3.0   APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS:             The following Technical Specifications are applicable: 3.1 OEM Component Maintenance Manual:                 3.1.1 CMM 35-13-61, REV 2, dated 01/31/2003  3.2	CG Technical Orders:   3.2.1 CG TCTO HU-25 935030.0, dated 08/01/1992   4.0   SERVICE BULLETINS  All service bulletins if not previously accomplished, shall be identified to the Contracting Officer.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining service bulletins.  Upon receipt of an oxygen mask requiring incorporation of such service bulletins, the contractor shall prepare a firm-fixed-price proposal IAW instructions listed below.  Service bulletins created and    incorporated during performance of this requirement may create new part number configurations, which supercede the previous configuration.  In cases where the old configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number shall be added to the contract, by written modification.  The contractor shall notify and request disposition instructions from the Contracting Officer for superceded parts, which have been removed and replaced by new part number configurations.  Upon receipt of notification from the Contracting Officer that a service bulletin is required, the Contractor shall submit, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notification, a firm-fixed-price proposal for an incremental charge to be assessed each time the service bulletin is incorporated in a component.  The proposal shall contain a breakdown of material and labor costs including hours, labor categories, labor rates, and applicable mark ups.  The incremental charge agreed to for incorporation of a service bulletin shall apply only to those components into which the Contractor incorporates a required service bulletin, not those into which the service bulletin has been previously incorporated.  Upon agreement of an incremental charge and issuance of a contract modification to reflect this change, the service bulletin shall be incorporated into each subsequent component received at the repair facility if said service bulletin has not already been incorporated.  When service bulletin incorporation changes the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) part number, the new part number shall be added to the    Contract, by written modification.  The same procedures apply if removal of service bulletins is required.  5.0 GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY:  IAW FAR 45.505-2(b)(2), the following components to be repaired and the value of government property to be shipped under this contract are as follows:P/N MF10-03-02, Oxygen Mask, $6,240.64 each.

The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose quote is identified as offering the best value solution.   The Source Selection Team (SST) may determine the best value for the Coast Guard merits a higher price based on technical superiority.  The SST, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal’s relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors: Factor 1 – Technical/Management Solution/Approach  Factor 2 – Performance Measures and Metrics  Factor 3 – Past Performance  Factor 4 – Cost/Price  Factors 1 and 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3.  While the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/Price Factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor.  Cost/Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical factors approach equal.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ)] for one (1) year of maintenance and service of servo-hydraulic equipment per the following SOW: This contract is to cover maintenance, repair and calibration for the 50+ Government –owned MTS test frames at Glenn Research Center.  This equipment resides in the Structures Division and Materials Divisions and is used for testing for materials characterization and life prediction modeling for the various programs supporting Space and Aeronautics.  Research involving this equipment often involves the utilization of these machines at their resolution limits.  Therefore, these machines must function according to their design specifications. The test equipment covers a wide range of machines including, but not limited to, servohydraulic, electromechanical and screwdriven machines.  The majority of these rigs are 20 and 50 kip uniaxial test systems.  There are also several axial/torsion, high cycle frequency, and custom-built high frequency/low frequency test rigs.  These rigs are controlled by various MTS controllers such as models 448 and 458 analog systems as well as TestStar and FlexTest digital controllers.   This contract will provide service for maintaining the proper operation of these test rigs.  This will include  the rebuilding of servovalves and actuators, repair/replacement of electronic boards, tuning of test rigs, and other necessary repairs to ensure the proper functioning of these rigs.  The term “rigs” constitute the load frame, controller, sensors, hydraulic pumps and lines, gripping system, environmental chambers, heating systems, and ancillary equipment, which may include any device connected to the rig and used to conduct the test.  The contractor shall provide original MTS parts for	the replacement of defective components to maintain the original design specifications and capabilities of the rig.  The contractor shall also maintain a spare parts inventory for the majority of the replacement parts such that minimal down-time is required at NASA.  The contractor shall also have the ability to manufacture unique components required for the rigs and produce them out of the correct choice of materials. The contractor shall also provide calibration services as requested by NASA.  This may include calibration of LVDTs, RVDTs, extensometers, and load cells under static and dynamic conditions, as well as aligning the load train.  All calibration standards and equipment used for this purpose shall be NIST traceable.  The contractor shall be compliant with the requirements in ANSI/NCSL Z540-1 and ISO 9001.  Also, all load cell calibrations shall be done in the load frame without disturbing the grips, cross-head, or load-train alignment unless otherwise permitted by NASA. The contractor shall provide software support for the MTS-supplied, Government-owned software packages and provide software upgrades and training for these packages as requested by NASA. Since NASA repairs some of the rigs themselves and adapts ancillary sensors and equipment to the test rigs, the contractor shall provide assistance over-the-phone to aid NASA researchers in interfacing this equipment with the MTS controllers and load frames.  For repairs that are not handled by NASA personnel, the contractor shall send a serviceman to fix the problems on the rigs.  The serviceman shall have at least two years experience diagnosing and repairing failures of MTS test rigs.  The serviceman shall be capable of diagnosing both system and component level failures. Since NASA does not have the proprietary drawings for the MTS equipment and since tight tolerances are required for many of the parts, the contractor shall provide evidence that they are trained and certified to repair MTS equipment.  This contract shall be similar to the Value Payment Plan offered by MTS. A complete itemized equipment listing will be provided upon request.   The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 01-25. The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 541990 and $6 million respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Period of Performance shall be one (1) year) Offers for the items(s) described above are due by COB December 21, 2004 to NASA/Glenn Research Center, Mail Stop 500-306, 21000 Brookpark Road, Cleveland, OH 44135, Attn:  Contracting Officer  and must include, solicitation number, FOB destination to this Center, proposed delivery schedule, discount/payment terms, warranty duration (if applicable), taxpayer identification number (TIN), CAGE Code,  identification of any special commercial terms, and be signed by an authorized company representative.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair nd timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
