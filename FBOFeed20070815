<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Coordinating Center for Infectious Disease (CCID), Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases (DVRD), Infectious Disease Pathology Branch (IDPB), Pathology laboratories are at the forefront of the agency's work in responding to public health threats posed by various infectious disease agents.  IDPB is currently home to an internationally recognized, multidisciplinary team that provides expertise in molecular pathology, histopathology, and ultra structural analysis for detecting microbial agents and studying the pathogenesis of infectious diseases.  Through the application of classic and evolving new technologies, the IDPB team has made significant contributions to advancing the understanding the pathogenesis and epidemiology of emerging infectious diseases.  As subject matter experts IDPB is at the forefront of the use of immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of infectious diseases and has evaluated many instruments throughout the years.  Thus, to the best of our knowledge only Thermo Fisher Scientific instrument fulfills our requirements and needs to respond to our responsibility to the agency in responding to various public health threats. Thermo Fisher offers the only IHC stainer on the market where 2 or more units work off the same computer.  This characteristic is required to enhance work flow as well as for better use of valuable laboratory space.  Also, this stainer has a pre-treatment module integrated on the machine which will allow for total automation of the entire staining process.  This characteristic is required for EID and BT test assays where pre-treatment is used to enhance the sensitivity. Thermo Fisher Scientific's autostainer is the only autostainer on the market that offers network capability, integrates with existing technology, and is equipped with a pre-treatment module. Therefore, Thermo Fisher Scientific is considered to be sole source IAW/FAR 6.302-1 and award of a Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13 is contemplated to it.  However, CDC will consider all responsible sources responding to the RFQ. All questions/concerns about the RFQ shall be submitted via e-mail to Bbiltz@cdc.gov ONLY. The RFQ document will be available and posted at this site for downloading. No telephone requests of the solicitation will be accepted. No hard copy of the RFQ will be mailed. It is your responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding the RFP on the Fedbizopps website.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Solicitation Number DTRT57-07-R-20025 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Contracting Officer is utilizing policies and procedures prescribed in Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items, and Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, and Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation.  This solicitation document, incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18 effective 06/30/2007.  The NAICS Code is 517110, Wired Telecommunications Carriers, and the Small Business size standard is 1,500 employees.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  This proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under FAR Part 6.302-1.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate, on a sole-source basis, an award of a Firm-Fixed-Price contract with Verizon Select Services, Inc., Burlington, MA, to provide services for the cable removal project at the U.S. DOT/RITA/Volpe Center, Cambridge, MA.  When the new telephone infrastructure was installed in 2003, the telephone riser cable running through the telephone closets throughout the Volpe Center campus, Cambridge, MA was found to be non-compliant with current telecommunications codes.  The current riser cable sheath, when reaching a certain temperature, gives off toxic fumes.  Current codes allow this type of cable up to only 50 feet into a building.  In order to mitigate this problem, the Contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, services, equipment and materials to perform those activities that are as specified in the following Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) 0001 through 0004, including reports and other products.  Proposals shall include pricing for the following four CLINs:  CLIN 0001, Inventory of Circuits and Removal of Old Infrastructure $__________; CLIN 0002, Cable Installation, Termination, Testing, and Labeling $__________; CLIN 0003 Installation of Fire Stopping Materials $__________; and CLIN 0004, Grounding, $__________.  The Period of Performance for CLINS 0001 through 0004 shall be sixteen (16) weeks after contract award, the date the contract is signed by the Contracting Officer.  Please note:  where the phrase ?should be completed? appears in this solicitation, the intent is for guidance, to show the Government?s expectation of the time the Contractor will need to perform tasks.  Certain tasks can be performed concurrently with other tasks.  CLIN 0001, Inventory of Circuits and Removal of Old Infrastructure:  The Contractor shall identify existing circuits cross-connected to the existing distribution infrastructure, and trace these circuits from the existing telecommunications closets, along the telecommunications pathways, to the originating frame(s) and block(s).  The Contractor shall deliver an inventory list of circuits to the Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative (COTR) in an electronic spreadsheet format compatible with Microsoft Excel, no later than four (4) weeks after contract award.  The inventory list shall include the following data elements:  circuit number; date of installation; location; circuit type; Volpe Center person requesting circuit; and carrier requesting circuit.  Upon receipt of the inventory, the COTR will ask the appropriate carrier(s) to generate orders to transfer of any old circuits to new distribution pairs on a new distribution infrastructure.  The Government expects this circuit transfer order step to be completed 6 weeks after receipt of the inventory list.  The Contractor shall transfer all circuits, those it owns as well as any remaining circuits (circuits that were not provisioned by the appropriate carrier(s), or were left over with no transfer orders or clear ownership).  Upon completion of all circuit transfers, the Contractor shall verify that all circuits have been transferred from the existing cable structure.  The Contractor shall remove and dispose of the existing 300 pair cable from the telecommunications closets to the frame room located in Building 1.  As stated above, the inventory of circuits shall be delivered to the COTR no later than four (4) weeks after contract award.  The circuit removal work associated with CLIN 0001 should be completed ten (10) weeks after contract award.  The verification work should be completed fourteen (14) weeks after contract award.  CLIN 0002 ? Cable Installation, Termination, Testing, and Labeling:  The Contractor shall provide and install Commscope Plenum Cat5e CMP UTP Data pipeline cables (estimated at 23,000 feet) as part of a new cable infrastructure to support all non-PBX-related telecommunications throughout the Volpe Center.  The Contractor shall provide and install two (2) twenty-five (25) pair cables in each of the Volpe Center?s thirty-five (35) telecommunications closets from the existing frame room, via the existing underground tunnel system to each building, and then shall distribute vertically, parallel to existing pathways, in each building?s stacked telecommunications closets.  All cable will be installed in compliance with TIA/EIA, ANSI, and NEC standards.  The Contractor shall terminate all cable in compliance with TIA/EIA 568 standards.  The Contractor shall terminate Category 5e data station cables at both near and far ends with Cat5e Krone 89D style termination blocks.  Installation and termination should be completed eight (8) weeks after contract award.  The Contractor shall test all voice cables at 100MHz for level II accuracy, shall clearly label all outlets with machine generated labels, and shall provide machine printed wrap around labels as specified.  The Contractor shall submit all test results to the COTR in electronic copy at the completion of these tasks.  The cable installation, termination, testing and labeling work associated with CLIN 0002 should be completed fourteen (14) weeks after contract award.  CLIN 0003 ? Installation of Fire Stopping Materials:  The Contractor shall provide and install firestopping materials in all telephone pathways located in the telecommunications closets throughout the Volpe Center campus.  Firestopping materials will conform to the following standards:  ASTM E119 OR UL 264 ? Standard Test Methods for Fire tests of Building Construction and Materials, and ASTM E814 OR UL 1479 ?

Description

The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC)/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Ocean Research & Applications Division/E/RA3 intends to award a requirement on a sole source basis with BOOST Technologies to obtain  maintenance support for a one year license and maintenance support for the batch version of SARTool for generation of automated wave products from Envisat, and Radarsat-1 data to be installed on two Linux computers at NOAA/NESDIS.

The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Tool (SARTool) software system, developed by Boost Technologies, allows user-friendly display, analysis, and product production from many types of satellite SAR data received at a number of acquisition stations around the world.  It is written as a Interactive Data Language (IDL) application which can be run under Windows or Linux operating systems.  There are three versions of SARTool, one is a demo version with a number of applications accessible via a Graphical User Interface, but with restricted data handling and output capabilities, the second is a research version with one or more applications accessible via a Graphical User Interface, but with the capability of handling full images and providing many output capabilities.  The third is a Linux batch version running one or more applications automatically via a Linux script.  The SARTool software can now process ScanSAR and Standard Mode SAR image data from the Alaska Satellite Facility acquisition station and initial validation of the SARTool wave products demonstrate that these products could be useful to the National Weather Service offices in Alaska where high waves in the coastal environment endanger barge transportation as well as commercial and recreational fishing activities. The National Weather Service (NWS) would like to evaluate SAR-derived wave products in the coastal environment.  The Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) would like to use SARTool to add wave products (swell and total wave significant wave height, dominant wave direction, and wave length) to the products provided to NWS within the Alaska SAR Demonstration (AKDEMO).  The AKDEMO now provides high-resolution winds, vessel positions, and SAR storm and ice imagery to the NWS on an experimental basis for evaluation of the utility of SAR-derived products within an operational forecast environment. 
 
The SARTool software to be purchased consists of a license for the Linux batch version of SARTool running the wave product system.  This software has the capability of automated batch generation of SAR-derived wave products.  This software provides swell and total wave significant wave height, dominant wave direction, and wave length measurements and color product imagery. The software should generate waves from SAR image data obtained from at least the ESA processing centers (Envisat),  and the Alaska Satellite Facility (Radarsat-1). The batch license should allow the software to be implemented on two computers at NESDIS (one in operations and a back-up in research).  These computers are running in parallel, redundantly processing the same data to allow continued product production in the case of failure of either computer. The license must also be movable if either or both of these computers are replaced with newer models.

	In addition to the software, installation instructions and algorithm descriptions or references to published descriptions for the wave product algorithms should be provided.


Interested parties who believe that they can meet the Government?s requirement are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response; all responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstration the ability to meet the above requirements. In your response, you must address each of the items listed above in sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirements. Failure to submit documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above. A determination by the Government not to open competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative written response must be received no later than fifteen days after publication of this synopsis. The solicitation for this requirement will be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12 procedures. A firm fixed price contract is contemplated. The period of performance shall be for twelve months. Responses may be emailed to Jay.Parsick@noaa.gov . Reference Solicitation No. NEED3000-7-16379 in your response. SEE NOTE 22

Description

The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC)/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Ocean Research & Applications Division/E/RA3 intends to award a requirement on a sole source basis with General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems to obtain  maintenance support for algorithms/products already developed by General Dynamics and currently running or currently being implemented into the AKDEMO and other applications demonstrations using C-band data from ERS-2, Radarsat-1 (with extension to Radarsat-2), and Envisat data, modification and enhancement of the current General Dynamics algorithms/products for use with multi-polarimetric L-band and X-band data from ALOS, Cosmo-Skymed, and other satellites that may become available during the term of this contract, modification and documentation of product software to make the SAR products system fully operational, and development of new products/algorithms exploiting multi-polarization and multi-frequency SAR data. 

Within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR), marine products derived from satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have been under development and demonstration since the early 1990?s.  A near-real-time applications demonstration of these products, called the Alaska SAR Demonstration (AKDEMO) has been underway since 1999. More recently, applications of these products to hurricane hazard response in the Gulf of Mexico and East Coast and to marine sanctuary monitoring in Hawaii and the Gulf of Maine have been demonstrated.  These products have been generated from C-Band (5.3 cm wavelength) SAR data from the European Space Agency (ESA) Second European Remote Sensing (ERS-2) satellite, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) Radarsat-1 satellite, and the European Space Agency (ESA) ENVISAT satellite. And products will soon be able to be generated from other types of SAR data, specifically from multi-polarization L-band (23 cm wavelength) data from the Japanese Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) starting in 2007, and X-band (3 cm wavelength) data from the Italian Cosmo-Skymed constellation starting in 2008. In the 2011-2012 time frame, the first in a series of operational SAR satellites will be launched, the Radarsat-C constellation and the Sentinel-1 constellation.  Japan may follow ALOS with an operational L-band satellite.  These satellites will have a data availability policy that will allow full operational product production and distribution.  SAR algorithms and products have matured to the point that they are ready for operational implementation. This contract will allow the tailoring of existing algorithms and products for multi-polarization data at different SAR wavelengths (C,L,and X), limited development of new products, and configuration and documentation of SAR products systems for operations.  

Vessel detection, wind speed and direction, ice masking, oil spill mapping and ocean wave parameters are all products that were developed for STAR by General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems (formerly Veridian, and before that ERIM International Inc.).  Recently, General Dynamics has delivered an improved vessel detection algorithm which is currently being validated and implemented, and a wave state algorithm which is being validated.  These algorithms are currently being run within a research demonstration environment.  Work is required to maintain the current algorithms/products and bring them into full compliance with operational coding and documentation standards.  Work is required to adapt and enhance the algorithms/products for use with multi-polarization L-band and X-band data. And development of new algorithms such as bathymetry mapping, surface currents, and surf-zone parameters would be advantageous to meet more of the documented requirements for operationally useful products from SAR data.

Maintenance, Development, and Operations Implementation of Marine Products Derived from Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar Data system includes:

?	Maintenance of existing algorithms/products being used in applications demonstrations in STAR

?	Modification and Enhancement of algorithms/products for use with other satellites

?	Software Modifications and Documentation to Make the SAR Products System Operational

?	Development of New Products/Algorithms Exploiting Multi-polarization and Multi-frequency SAR Data.

<DESC>A/B MAC CYCLE 2 ? JURISDICTIONS 6, 11, 14 & 15

Section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to take the necessary steps between now and 2011 to implement Medicare Contracting Reform (MCR).  MCR will bring standard contracting principles to Medicare such as competition and performance incentives.  These basic contracting principles, which have been applied to other federal programs under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), have been missing from the Medicare contracting environment.  CMS is required to replace the current contracting authority under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act with the new Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) authority.  The MAC?s will perform the work currently being handled by fiscal intermediaries, carriers, regional home health intermediaries and durable medical equipment regional carriers in administering the Medicare fee-for-service program.  

CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for the Part A and Part B Medicare Administrative Contractors (A/B MAC) for Jurisdiction 6 (comprised of the states of Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin), Jurisdiction 11 (comprised of the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia), Jurisdiction 14 (comprised of the states of Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont) and Jurisdiction 15 (compromised of the states of Kentucky and Ohio).    

The A/B MAC will provide specified fee-for-service health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, for most all institutional health care as well as for providers.  It is anticipated that this solicitation will result in the award of seven stand-alone A/B MAC contracts.  These contracts will include a base year and four one-year options.  CMS anticipates releasing the solicitation on or about August 30, 2007.

<DESC>A/B MAC CYCLE 2 JURISDICTIONS 8, 9 & 10

Section 911 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to take the necessary steps between now and 2011 to implement Medicare Contracting Reform (MCR).  MCR will bring standard contracting principles to Medicare such as competition and performance incentives.  These basic contracting principles, which have been applied to other federal programs under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), have been missing from the Medicare contracting environment.  CMS is required to replace the current contracting authority under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act with the new Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) authority.  The MACs will perform the work currently being handled by fiscal intermediaries, carriers, regional home health intermediaries and durable medical equipment regional carriers in administering the Medicare fee-for-service program.  

CMS anticipates releasing a solicitation for the Part A and Part B Medicare Administrative Contractors (A/B MAC) for Jurisdiction 8 (comprised of the states of Indiana and Michigan), Jurisdiction 9 (comprised of the states of Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands), Jurisdiction 10 (comprised of the states of Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee).

The A/B MAC will provide specified fee-for-service health insurance benefit administration services, including Medicare claims processing and payment services, for most all institutional health care as well as for providers.  It is anticipated that this solicitation will result in the award of seven stand-alone A/B MAC contracts.  These contracts will include a base year and four one-year options.  CMS anticipates releasing the solicitation on or about August 30, 2007.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement for clinical agent and clinical specimen repository support.

Research supported and conducted by the NIAID, NIH, DHHS, strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents other than Human Immunodeficiency Virus. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics, which is funded through a variety of research grants and contracts. 

Developing and testing new vaccines and therapies have historically been a major focus of the research supported by the DMID.  Much of this research is devoted to addressing critical public health needs, such as those related to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (e.g., avian influenza and West Nile Virus), as well as those supporting the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates against potential agents of bioterrorism, including NIAID priority biodefense pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/bandc_priority.htm).  In order to ensure that the development, testing and manufacture of products evaluated under DMID-supported clinical research are executed with a rigor that will support licensure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), DMID supports the establishment and operation of a Clinical Agent and Specimen Repository (CASR) that adheres to current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP), Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) for the acquisition, receipt, storage and shipping of clinical agents and clinical specimens in support of DMID sponsored clinical trials and research programs in the U.S. and abroad.  Regulatory support services are currently being recompeted through a separate contract solicitation.

Clinical agents include investigational study products (drugs, vaccines, and therapeutics), commercial products, placebos, syringes, and other protocol-mandated supplies to be used in DMID-sponsored clinical trials.  For the purposes of this contract, other protocol-mandated supplies include electronic adherence measuring devices and associated devices for downloading data, thermometers, oral syringes, adaptors for transferring liquids from bottles to syringes, syringes for injection, and pregnancy test kits. Clinical specimens include sera or other protocol-mandated specimens obtained from DMID-funded clinical research sites, to be distributed to DMID-approved testing laboratories for analysis.

It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a 7-year base period of performance beginning on or about 
August 2008, with the following options:  Option 1: Increase clinical specimen capacity of the CASR in order to accommodate the following: -80oC (approximately 1600 cu. ft.) and -20oC (approximately 1600 cu. ft.). Option 2: Increase the length of time for the storage of clinical specimens in the CASR to exceed the short-term storage requirement of two (2) years as specified in the base requirement, to provide for storage until the end of the contract period of performance. Option 3: The Government may extend the contract for up to an additional two (2) years.  It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows: for Option 1: 0.6 FTE; for Option 2: 0.4 FTE; and for Option 3: given that this is an expansion of the base, 11.05 FTEs would be required.

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about August 27, 2007, and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Contracting Office, Albuquerque, NM intends to award a single source contract to L-3 Communications, Titan Corporation.  A previous notice for sources sought for this requirement was posted Mar 29, 2007 under reference number HDTRA2-08-C-0000.
The objective for this nuclear weapons effects (NWE) Test Support contract is to provide for the continued availability of all of the DTRA NWE simulators in support of U.S. Government agency NWE testing and commercial businesses needs.  DTRA NWE simulators are currently located at the L-3 Communications Titan Corporation?s facility in San Leandro, California, and DTRA does not intend to relocate the simulators at government expense.  The contractor will be responsible for its economic viability, and marketing of test capabilities to potential customers, in conjunction with performing the tasks described in the Statement of Work (SOW).  The draft SOW will be made available to interested parties upon request.
DTRA conducts a broad spectrum of specialized test support for DoD nuclear systems survivability programs and the DOE Stockpile Stewardship program.  This effort requires operation and maintenance of DTRAs Double-EAGLE, Pithon, and Modular Bremsstrahlung Source (MBS) Simulators.  In addition this effort requires the operation and maintenance of the Simulator Operating System, Data Acquisition System, and DTRA-owned hardware associated with the Pulserad 1150 simulator.  Results derived from these activities shall be captured through comprehensive documentation.  DTRA will not pay the contractor for these services.  These services will be funded by customer test fees.  The contractor shall operate and maintain DTRA?s x-ray simulator capabilities to support customer testing.  This may include, but is not limited to, providing engineering and scientific support to test customers; assisting in test design, data collection and analysis; performing routine maintenance and repairs on DTRA simulators; maintaining an adequate stock of spare parts and an active inventory control system; keeping detailed configuration control records of changes to simulators; performing upgrades to simulators to meet near-term test customer requirements; maintaining an archive of test data; operating and maintaining the simulator control system and data acquisition system; and facility security and Environmental, Safety and Health (ESH) programs.  In exchange for these services the contractor will be permitted to use the above Government Property (GP) to perform contracts separately with federal agencies, defense contractors, and commercial businesses to provide test support, test time, and upgrades.  The DTRA Simulator Program has provided test support to numerous weapon and satellite system customers.  Past customers have included the Air Force MILSTAR, Small ICBM, B1 Bomber, Minuteman III, Army Pershing Missile and THAAD; and the Navy Trident Program.  Current customers include the Air Force Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) and Space Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) satellites; Navy/Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) Trident Life Extension and SNL Stockpile Stewardship Programs. Emerging weapon system program offices that have expressed an interest in testing at the DTRA simulator facilities include the Air Force Space Tracking & Surveillance System (STSS), Transformational Satellite (TSAT), the Trident/Minuteman III Replacement ICBM and the MDA exo-atmospheric and multiple kill vehicle systems.  In addition to providing test environments for survivability testing, DTRA simulators have been used to validate a substantial number of Nuclear Weapons Effects (NWE) models and associated effects.  These computer models are an integral part of the survivability validation process and provide the system developer with a cost effective way of designing survivability into their system before hardware fabrication has started.  The list of codes and models validated on DTRA models is substantial.  Some of the model and code phenomena that DTRA Simulators have been used to validate include internal EMP, Circuit Response, Photocurrents, Thermal Structural Response, System Generated EMP, Combined Thermal Loading, Device Physics, Transient Radiation Electronic Effects, Material and Structural Response and Space and Ground System Effects and Assessment.
The subject contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (L-3 Communications, Titan Corporation) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Contract award is anticipated for 21 December 2007.  This synopsis does not constitute an invitation for bids (IFB) or a request for proposals (RFP) and shall not be construed as a commitment by the government.  GPE numbered note 22.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to negotiate with Social and Scientific Systems, Inc. located in Silver Spring, Maryland on a sole source basis to add a new component to the current contract, HHSN291200445525.  Under this component, the contractor will enroll an additional 2000 women in the United States and Puerto Rico to the 50,000 current target, the majority of whom have been enrolled.  The criteria for the new enrollment cohort is women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer within the last 3 years who are the sister of a participant already enrolled in the study, and their living parents.  The purpose of the addition of these enrollees is to study the joint effects of genes and environmental factors on breast cancer etiology and prognosis.   Authority:  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306.302-1.  Inherent duplication of costs to the Government, the need for consistency and compatibility in epidemiologic methods and procedures, the closely related association with the basic cohort, and unnecessary delays in completing the enrollment of the expanded cohort render competition unfeasible.  See notes No. 22 and 26.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title: 	Zeiss Motorized Axio Imager Z1 Fluorescence Microscope with AxioVision Digital Image Processing System

Purpose/Brief History:

The CCS has three missions: to provide state-of-the-art clinical cytogenetics diagnostic services to patients seen at the NIH Clinical Center; to perform high quality clinical and translational research in cancer cytogenetics; and to train students, residents, and fellows in the subspecialty field of cytogenetics.  Services include a variety of tests for detection of constitutional (i.e., congenital) and acquired chromosomal abnormalities.  The results of cytogenetics testing are often critical for correct diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of patients.  The results also help elucidate the DNA lesions involved in both the initiation and progression of cancer.  Thus, cytogenetics is an area that is important to the patient care as well as the clinical and research missions of the NCI and other Institutes.

The Zeiss Motorized Axio Imager Z1 Fluorescence Microscope with AxioVision Digital Image Processing System will be used to perform interphase and metaphase fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analyses for patient care and clinical molecular cytogenetics research.  Over the past decade FISH technology, reagents, and applications to clinical cytogenetics have expanded tremendously.  In many cases FISH is now standard of care for diagnosis and monitoring constitutional and malignant disease.  FISH is often the best method for application to collaborative clinical research projects, and the CCS has received numerous requests for this testing from investigators within and outside the NCI.  Our use of this technology has more than tripled over the past five years (from ~150 hybridizations in 2002 to nearly 500 hybridizations in 2006).  

PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1)  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

The CCS requires a fluorescence microscope and image processing system to meet the increased demand for interphase and metaphase FISH for patient diagnostic services and clinical research.  This system must provide high resolution; expanded fluorescence capability; speed and ease of use; and quality image capture, processing, and storage capabilities.  The Zeiss Motorized Axio Imager Z1 Microscope and AxioVision Imaging System best meet all of CCS's specifications in one integrated system.  The Zeiss Motorized Axio Imager Z1 microscope has a number of unique features not available from other companies.  These include a motorized high precision Z-focus drive, with 10 nm increments, that allows for rapid focus and highly reproducible Z-stacked images; a motorized 10-position fluorescence reflector turret; EC fluorescent cubes with light traps that optimize the signal to noise ratio; an Apochromatic fluorescence light train that allows for all light wavelengths to be focused together; and a TFT display with touch screen that allows the user to easily program and configure the motorized microscope, and quickly change between contrasting techniques, without using the external PC as a "stand alone" system.  Together these features allow for rapid, user-friendly visualization of high resolution, bright fluorescent signals, in as many as 10 colors, with attenuated background "noise."  Other features perhaps not unique to Zeiss, but perfected by this company over the past decade, include stable cell integrated design of the objective nosepiece with stage and Z-focus separate from the remainder of the stand that allows for superior 2-axis stability relative to ambient temperature fluctuations and vibrations; and PLAN APO 63X/1.4 and 100X/1.4 oil objectives that are ideally suited for our work.  The CCS intends to purchase an additional triple band filter set for efficient analysis of DAPI/FITC/TRITC FISH with this system.  The imaging equipment includes a high quality B & W digital camera, PC computer, Samsung 19" LCD monitor, and AxioVision software.  This system provides efficient microscope control, flexible camera operation, rapid image processing, integration of text and graphic elements, precise image measurement, ZVI images, and efficient image archiving.  All of these features are mandatory for the performance of patient diagnostic testing, results documentation, and record keeping as required by the College of American Pathologists and CLIA '88 standards.  This microscope and image processing system is compatible with the CCS's existing government owned Zeiss and PC-based equipment, and will permit the CCS to network this new system to other computers and printers in the laboratory, thus allowing for easy image transfer and/or printing.  The CCS must be able to interchange parts, such a the PLAN APO objectives, immediately if necessary.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Original notice posted 13 February, 2003 stated that the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) plans to release a Two Step Seal Bid (IFB) for Human Resource Service Support and Administration at the Washington, DC and Fort Worth Currency locations.
A decision on the acquisition approach has been approved in conjunction with the SBA Central Office and SBA Washington District 0353, and has been approved as a Competitive 8(a) set-aside under $3 million. This decision has been cancelled due to insufficient 8(a) companies showing an interest in this requirement and market research conducted.  The IFB will be issued as a total (100%) set aside for Small Businesses.

<DESC>The government provided Addendum No. 2 which referenced ?sheet FP 101 ? Auditorium 139C.  Remove the four pairs of exterior doors on the east and west sides. Replace with new aluminum doors ? Pair 3'-0" x 7'-0".  Match new door from 139C phase 2 (Full glass) cleaning the existing glazing, store front (inside & out) and aluminum flashing. The government has also provided specifications in the Addendum 2 for the contractor to meet these requirements.

Our subcontractor (Best Glass) has made a site visit in which he has discovered that the specifications call for a concealed closure and the Amendment 2 requires the contractor to match the existing closure units in the building. This does not meet the new Section 08120 specifications.

Registration may be accomplished  at http://www.ccr2000.com/index.cfm, or 1-888-CCR-2423 Fax:  1-703-696-0213. SCOPE OF WORK:  This project renovates the interior and installs fire  suppression that doesn’t currently exist.  It includes complete  replacement of the HVAC and electrical systems.  The fire alarm is so  outdated it cannot be repaired and requires replacement.  The requirement  for fire suppression/detection carries an FSD 3.  The renovation will  correct life safety deficiencies such as a conference room with inadequate  egress.  The project will reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient  use of space. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: No fire suppression currently exists and  fire alarms are unreliable.  Work is necessary to bring the Wing  Headquarters building into compliance with Life Safety Code, Handicapped  Access and to reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient use of space.  HVAC and electrical systems require revitalization due to age and addition  of ADP equipment.  HVAC has failed on several occasions requiring  temporary heaters and A/C to be brought in until repairs could be made.  The system has been repaired several times but is not expected to be  reliable in the future.  The mechanical system will remain in operation to  serve the first floor.  The first floor will remain occupied by the Wing  Command Section and ASC/JA during construction.  This will require the  contractor to provide temporary rigging for the demolition and material  delivery.  All first floor accesses will have to be maintained during the  construction.  There will be numerous occasions where the contractor will  need to stop performing work to accommodate special events and  distinguished visitors. NOTES: 1.

<DESC>The Federal Acquisition Service of the General Services Administration (GSA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement a Local Services Acquisition (LSA) for Telecommunications Services.  The Government will award a series of Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts, with a base period of three years and four (4) twelve month option periods.  Firm Fixed Price task orders will be issued under the resultant IDIQ contract.  The Government plans to award multiple LSA contracts in the states of Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Delaware.  These contracts will be for the use of all Federal agencies, authorized Federal contractors, agency-sponsored universities and laboratories and, as authorized by law or regulation, state, local, and tribal Governments, and other organizations.  The Government has defined three service groups: Voice Services (VS), Data Transmission Services (DTS) and Internet Access Services (IAS), along with the labor and material necessary to connect these services to customer premises equipment (CPE).  Offerors must propose mandatory voice services to be eligible for an award.

The Government intends to make multiple awards for LSA services but reserves the right to limit the number of awards.  Contracts will be awarded to Offerors whose proposals are most advantageous to the Government.  The actual number of contracts awarded will be determined by the Government and based on technical acceptability and price evaluation of mandatory LSA services.  The following Technical factors will be considered: Technical Approach, Past Performance, and Management Approach.  The Technical Factors of Technical Approach and Past Performance will be approximately equal in weight and each will be greater in weight than the Management Approach factor.  The combined weight of all technical evaluation factors will be approximately equal to the Price Factor of Total Evaluated Discounted Cost.  Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used as set forth in FAR Part 15.  Offerors are advised that an award may be made without discussion or any contact concerning the proposals received.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; and to award contracts to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total evaluated discounted cost.  Therefore, proposals should be initially submitted on the most favorable terms.

The Request for Proposal (RFP), consisting of the solicitation and all attachments will be issued and posted electronically on the www.fedbizoppps.gov website.  Any questions regarding this synopsis should be directed to Kristin L. Markiewicz, GSA Contract Specialist, at Kristin.Markiewicz@gsa.gov.  This procurement is being conducted under full and open competition on an unrestricted basis under NAICS Code 517110.  The solicitation should be available on or about 07/23/2007.  Potential offerors should be advised that the date of a pre-proposal conference will be announced at the same time as the issuance of the RFP and is estimated to be conducted approximately two weeks after the official RFP is posted.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INDUSTRY COMMENTS ON SETA DRAFT PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT. In Sept 2007, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to issue an RFP for Science, Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) Services to the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) and its subordinate organizations.  When the solicitation is released there will be a notice of a pre-proposal conference to review and discuss the effort.  A draft Performance Work Statement is attached for review and comments.  Please note this is only a working draft and some elements may be incomplete or lacking in final form.  Therefore, the actual PWS, when released with the solicitation, may differ from this draft document.  However, the release of the draft provides Industry an opportunity to comment on the Agencys requirements before the formal request for proposal is released.  The objective of this contract action is to acquire contractor support in areas of scientific, engineering and technical services as well as business management and professional services to monitor and conduct studies analysis and evaluations; contract support and administrative/clerical support services.  It will require the contractor to provide program and technical management support, technical evaluation, operations support, program planning and oversight, test and evaluation, project analysis, risk mitigation, data development and management, as well as business functions to include financial, human resources, information technology, security and general administrative services and technical and programmatic support for current as well as future programs and functions.  We also request industry comment on contract type and structure.  The Government is interested in obtaining skill sets needed for high level science and engineering services as described in the PWS.  Comments regarding the manner in which appropriate, skilled and qualified personnel will be supplied and retained are welcomed.  The Government and SETA contractor must understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor are non-personal services, no employer-employee relationship will exist between the Government and Contractors personnel.  Please note, this is not a marketing and/or sales opportunity therefore we request you refrain from submitting marketing brochures and sales information.  The response to this request shall be not more than three (3) pages in length.  We anticipate DHS/DNDO will host an Industry Day prior to the release of the RFP to brief all interested parties on this requirement.  For that reason, please ensure that your response to this RFI includes a point of contact, facsimile number, or means to receive notice of the date and time.  All vendors that respond to this RFI will be invited to the Industry Day.  Current information for Karen Green is (202)254-7096, Fax (202)254-7785.  Please note email to both Rhonda Trent and Karen Green is the preferred submission method.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to solicit for the purchase of one (1) each Open Radar Data Acquisition (ORDA) I/O Panel Auto Test Fixture, P/N O/I-62CP-ORDA and one (1) each SIGMET Factory Test & Maintenance Manual for the National Weather Service (NWS), National Reconditioning Center (NRC) NEXRAD program. The ORDA Panel Test fixture is used for the automatic testing of every input/output pin on ORDA panels. In addition, an interactive graphical user interface is provided to set the cathode voltage level threshold.  In practice, the ORDA Panel to be tested is mounted in the test fixture and the test cables are then connected to it.  The testing starts immediately when the ORDA panel is fully connected.  Results are displayed on the RCP8 front panel. A flashing arrow indicator on the RCP8 integral front panel display then prompts the operator to adjust the cathode voltage threshold (pot). The manual is on SIGMET?s in-house factory configuration and test procedures. The ORDA project of the NWS was awarded to RSIS, Inc. and was deployed in FY 2006.  SIGMET, a division of Vaisala, Inc. was contracted by RSIS, Inc. as a sub-contractor to provide the meteorological equipment used to extract weather information from the radar echoes and the upgraded NEXRAD receiver section.  The weather equipment provided by SIGMET and installed by RSIS is proprietary to SIGMET and Vaisala. Unsolicited Proposal NRC060928, from SIGMET, documents the equipment required ?in the troubleshooting, test, repair and maintenance of RVP8 digital receiver and RCP8 radar control processors that have been supplied to the ORDA upgrade program?.  The NRC, as the sole depot repair facility for the NWS weather monitoring equipment, must repair this proprietary equipment.  The ORDA Panel Test Fixture and Test and Maintenance Manual are required to accomplish the depot repair mission. The test fixture and maintenance manual are not available from any other vendor.  The Government does not have specifications or any adequately detailed information to solicit a bid from another source.  These items will be delivered to the National Weather Service (NWS)/National Reconditioning Center (NRC), Kansas City, MO. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source. The company is Vaisala, Inc., 2 Park Drive, Suite #1, Westford, MA 01886-3525.  However, all proposals received within 10 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue an order to Vaisala, Inc., whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the Government without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to equipment that meets the form, fit, and function of that described herein.  Interested firms should submit the information, its name, address, point of contact, and telephone number. Also include the name, telephone number, and point of contact for businesses or other Government agency to which it has previously provided the equipment to. Offerors may send their response to karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or fax to 816-274-6952 ATTN: Karen Christian. The NAICS code for this requirement is 335999.  All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the Agency.

Description
SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
Each year, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) undertakes immigration enforcement actions involving hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals.  These actions include the arrest, detention, and removal from the United States of foreign nationals who are in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).  These violations include:  losing legal status by failing to abide by the terms and conditions of entry, or by engaging in crimes such as terrorist activity? violent crimes, document fraud, and drug smuggling.  Responsibility for the enforcement of immigration laws within the interior United States rests with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). 
United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Office of Acquisitions Management is currently seeking sources for a potential requirement to provide detainee telephone services at Service Processing Centers (SPCs), Contract Detention Facilities (CDFs), and State/local government facilities (IGSAs) located throughout the US and US Territories.  No call volume is guaranteed, however, ATTACHMENT A lists the current operating locations and the number of phone required. This contract is contemplated as a zero cost ($0) contract.  Revenue generated from detainee debit card and collect calling at Primary sites will be the source of compensation.  There were approximately twelve million (12,000,000) local debit and collect calls; twenty-four million (24,000,000) long distance debit and collect calls; and two million (2,000,000) international debit and collect calls for the most recent twelve month period from these Primary sites.
This is a sources sought synopsis only.  This is not a solicitation announcement. No contract will be awarded from this notice. No reimbursement will be made for any cost associated with providing information in response to this notice.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Information provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. 
The proposed requirement mentioned herein is being considered for Small Business; Small Disadvantaged Businesses, 8(a); Women Owned Businesses; Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses; Veteran-Owned Small Businesses; HUB-zone Certified; potential joint venture partners; or teaming partners.  The government will use responses to this sources sought notice to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  The Office of Acquisition Management is currently seeking small businesses that can perform all of the requirements listed below.  The contractor shall be prepared to provide detention phones and detention phone services in compliance with National Detention Standards, as amended. Transition period is estimated at sixty days. The contractor shall fulfill these responsibilities at various locations throughout the US and US Territories. These requirements fall under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 517110.  Interested firms must demonstrate in their qualifications statement that they are qualified to perform all of the required tasks under this NAICS code. 
The resulting contract is anticipated to be a Fixed Rate Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity with a twenty-four (24) month base and three (3) twelve (12) month options. This will be a zero ($0) cost contract with revenue generated from the sale of debit cards or through collect calls from the Primary sites.  An initial listing of Primary and Secondary sites is provided in Attachment A and will be updated at contract award. Primary and Secondary sites will be added and removed from this list throughout the life of the contract. The contractor shall provide all personnel, materials, and equipment necessary to perform under the contract. 
Interested Small Business; Small Disadvantaged Businesses, 8(a); Women Owned Businesses; Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses; Veteran-Owned Small Businesses; HUB-zone Certified; potential joint venture partners; or teaming partners should provide the DHS/USICE with appropriate documentation (i.e. a detailed capability statement and/or relevant past performance history documenting its ability to perform similar requirements). Standard company brochures are not desired. Experience and past performance does not necessarily require telecommunication service within a detention facility or jail setting.
DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIREMENT:  
1.	The vendor will provide telephone services and all equipment necessary for the fourteen (14) ?Primary? detention facilities listed in Attachment A of this Sources Sought Notice.  These Primary facilities currently have a total of about 1300 phones. Primary and Secondary sites will be added and deleted during the life of the contract.  Local, long distance and international call revenue will accrue from the Primary sites listed in Attachment A.  Secondary sites shall be provided access to the pro bono network only while full telephone services, including access to the pro bono network, will be required at Primary sites. ICE may allow the vendor to offer pre-paid phone services to ICE detainees at all IGSAs in the future. If the respondent wishes to suggest an alternative means of performance, please describe those differences fully.
2.	All calls made will be firm-fixed price per minute with no mandatory price set per call or any additional charges added.  These rates will remain in effect during the entire period of performance and can only be changed through negotiations and codified through a contract modification. Charges for collect calls as well as pre-paid calls at Primary sites should be described. 
3.	The call per minute usage fee will start once the call is positively accepted.
4.	Telephone calls will consist of local and U.S. long distance calls, international calls and free calls to a pro bono network managed by the vendor. Revenue producing connections are made through debit and/or collect calls at the primary sites. All local, long distance and international calls made will be paid by the detainee through collect and debit card calling except calls made to the pro bono network. 
5.	The contractor will be required to assert that all local and U.S. long distance calls made by the detainee will consist only of acceptable charges as are applied by local dominant carriers. 
6.	At a minimum, international calls placed to Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Canada and the Dominican Republic will have set per minute rates. All other locations can be charged at the same rate.
7.	There must be at least one (1) phone per twenty-five (25) detainees at each Primary location. This requirement is in accordance with current Detention Phone Standards which are subject to change. No phones are required to be provided at Secondary locations, only access to the pro bono speed dial system. The current number of telephones is about one thousand three hundred (1300) system-wide. 
8.	Contractor shall structure a telephone system at Primary and Secondary locations which permits free calls to pro bono numbers.  The telephone software must allow for new numbers or changes to existing numbers to be programmed into the pro bono system quickly. Pro bono calls are made to the local Immigration Courts and Board of Immigration Appeals; to Federal and State Courts; to Consular officials; to legal service providers in pursuit of legal representation; to Government offices to obtain documents relevant to his/her immigration case; and, in a personal or family emergency.  These calls are considered pro bono and will be free to the detainee.  All pro bono numbers (except family numbers) will be ?speed dialed? and not direct dialed except when necessary due to circumstances as determined by local ICE officials. The current list of pro bono numbers consists of about 1500 phone numbers. Most sites have a need for about 200 speed dial numbers. 
9.	Telephones at Primary locations must not allow incoming calls. 
10.	Detention telephone software utilized at the Primary locations should be current to the industry and must be maintained with updates for the life of the contract. The telephone software must allow for normal detention processes including call monitoring and call blocking.  Training in the use of this software must be provided to ensure proper use at all sites.  Training will be conducted at ICE HQ offices in Washington, D.C., and/or regional CONUS locations.
11.	The electronic telephone debit card system should allow detainees to easily access their account to check balances, make a call (local, long distance, international or pro bono), or report an unauthorized or incorrect deduction on their account.
12.	A Plexiglas or similar partition which provides privacy during a detainee?s call but still allows for proper monitoring of the detainees shall be installed at all Primary locations, if one is not already present.
13.	A Quality Control Plan that adequately addresses contractor compliance will be required as part of the proposal process.
14.	Upon request, the Contractor shall provide instructions for telephone usage in a detainee?s native language.  English and Spanish are the most requested languages currently.
15.	Detainees must be able to make pro bono calls if the telephone system totally fails.
16.	Contractor shall provide an audit system which, at a minimum, provides the following reports monthly and are maintained for the life of the contract:
A.	total number of minutes used per location; and,
B.	total number of minutes used by local, long distance, international and pro bono calls at each location by individual.
17.	Contractor shall provide a method to accomplish the following and shall report on these issues monthly:
A.	a tracking system for inoperable telephones or software;
B.	date of service request and date and time of repair;
C.	trend analysis by system and location: number of hours/days phones were  not functioning, local subcontractor utilized (if any) and what methods contractor used to fix current problem.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:  ICE assumes no liability for the equipment, damage to the equipment, vandalism to the equipment by detainees, or the cost associated with maintenance, repairs and upkeep of the system.  Placement and operation of a detainee telephone system in ICE and contractor run facilities is the sole risk and responsibility of the contractor.  Repairs, replacement, maintenance, upgrades or general upkeep of the proposed system will remain the responsibility of the Contractor.

<SUBJECT>Joint Counter Radio-Controlled IED Electronic Warfare [JCREW] Announcement Soliciting Industry Comments on the CREW 3.3 System Architecture Development
<DESC>The Department of Defense is initiating an incremental development of a System Of Systems to counter the threat posed by the world wide proliferation of Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RC-IEDs).  The full System Of Systems will provide dismounted personnel, vehicles and fixed sites protection from RC-IEDs.  The DoD anticipates these systems will use a common open architecture that will support modularity and expandability between systems and cost effective upgrades to counter future threats.   In developing the required System Of Systems, the DoD anticipates awarding one or more contracts.  The prime contractor will assume sole responsibility for transforming the Governments performance specification into the final System Of Systems.  In accomplishing this, the prime contractor will assume the system engineering role in allocating requirements between the dismounted, mounted and fixed systems.  Additionally, the prime contractor will develop and deliver the required systems, either through direct in house design or through subcontracting.  This is not envisioned as a Lead System Integrator contract, but as a prime contractor with responsibility for design and development.   The DoD anticipates it will develop and define a GFI open modular architecture for JCREW 3.3 program.  This architecture will help the contractor understand the Government’s expectation of functional requirements allocation and define the interfaces between functional requirements.  The DoD desires industry feedback in developing and defining this architecture.      Background: The DoD is soliciting Industry feedback on potential CREW 3.3 System Architecture Concepts.  These concepts have been developed to establish a basis for Industry dialog with the Government regarding potential approaches to best satisfy an Open Architecture requirement for CREW 3.3 systems.  In developing these concepts, the Government has considered multiple factors including, but not limited to: operational experience with legacy systems, technology status, anticipated technology rate of change, the requirement for an 'open' system design, system upgradeability to allow for system capability expansion and/or emerging technology insertion, and or to refresh its technology to maintain its capability and supportability.  The Government desires this dialog with Industry to review and comment on the System Architecture Concepts to insure that, if imposed, the System Architecture Concepts would result in an effective and long term supportable/upgradeable CREW 3.3 system.  It is a!  lso desired that this Architecture dialog with Industry would result in maximum participation from Industry during any subsequent solicitations, should they arise, to develop and maintain such a system. Process: The documents describing the Government's CREW 3.3 System Architecture Concepts will be shared with Industry via a posting of those documents at the JCREW Clearinghouse site.  Interested vendors must appropriately register with the JCREW Clearinghouse site as described below to participate in this process.  In order to obtain the most candid dialog with Industry, the Government's reference documentation will be available to everyone at the JCREW Clearinghouse site.  Individual vendor comments on those documents and the subsequent responses to the particular vendor comments will not be released; however, the Government will assess all the interactions with Industry and may revise the reference documentation if the results of the Industry interaction warrant doing so.  Furthermore, to foster complete and honest feedback, the Government will properly protect and not disclose any appropriately marked proprietary information.  If changes are made, the new edition of the reference!   documentation will again be publicly posted at the JCREW Clearinghouse site for a second round of comments from Industry which will be handled using the same process as was done for the first round. Registering with JCREW Clearinghouse: To register with the JCREW Clearinghouse, the user must have either a DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate or an External Certification Authority (ECA).  If you do not have either a PKI or ECA certificate, information to obtain the certificate can be found here: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/.  To register with the JCREW Clearinghouse, go to: https://jcrew.muwinfodesk.navy.mil and click on the “New User” button.  Follow the instructions that are included in the on line form.  When registering, indicate that you would like access to the JCREW Clearinghouse as a “Contractor.”  Any access other than “Contractor” requires a government sponsor and additional validation.  Your email address will be validated, and your request verified by JCREW Clearinghouse personnel.  Your user name and password will be mailed to you upon approval within 48 hours.

<SUBJECT>B -- CDC Implementation Case Studies- Pediatricians Implementing, Evaluating, and Disseminating Strategies to Improve Parental Monitoring and Supervision
<DESC>00HCTC12-2007-45628
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Centers for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a purchase order to the American Academy of Pediatrics, 141 Northwest Point Blvd., Elk Grove Village, IL 6007-1017; as it is believed that the American Academy of Pediatrics possesses unique qualifications and demonstrates a unique capability to provide the following services: 

Implementation Case Studies:  Pediatricians Implementing, Evaluating, and Disseminating Strategies to Improve Parental Monitoring and Supervision.

I.  BACKGROUND    

Age appropriate parental supervision and monitoring is a key approach to preventing violence and unintentional injuries impacting infants and children.  Pediatricians have been identified as one key facilitator to provide parents with information and support on age appropriate supervision.  Encouraging pediatricians to provide this anticipatory guidance around supervision and supplying them with the tools and resources to feel comfortable sharing this information with parents is critical to the successful implementation of this strategy.

Connected Kids:  Safe, Strong, Secure provides a comprehensive, logical approach for health care providers to integrate parental supervision violence prevention into their practice.  Connected Kids takes an asset-based approach to anticipatory guidance, focusing on helping parents and families raise resilient children.  Each counseling topic discusses the child?s development, the parent?s feelings and reactions in response to the child?s development and behavior, and specific practical suggestions on how to encourage healthy social, emotional, and physical growth in an environment of support and open communication.  Connected Kids includes a clinical guide with counseling suggestions for each well-child visit and 21 patient education brochures for parents and teens.  The program is intended to be used in well-child care from birth to age 21 years.

CDC has underway the Connected Kids Implementation Project. 27 pediatricians are working to improve parental supervision and monitoring by implementing the middle childhood section of Connected Kids (ages 5 to 10 years) in their practices.  Through the Implementation Project, we are obtaining valuable insight into how well Connected Kids improves pediatricians? knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about violence prevention and parenting practices; the feasibility of incorporating Connected Kids content in health supervision visits; and whether Connected Kids helps pediatricians take an asset-based approach to their counseling.  The Implementation Project will also provide us with ideas regarding how Connected Kids training and implementation materials can be improved to facilitate pediatrician adoption of strategies to improve parental supervision and monitoring.

II.  PURPOSE     

CDC will support a case study in 8 diverse pediatric practices to provide the Federal Government with information on:
?	how well Connected Kids improves physician?s knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about violence prevention and parenting practices; 
?	the barriers and facilitators in pediatric practices to using this anticipatory guidance model;
?	and the training needs of pediatricians to successfully implement Connected Kids,


III.  SCOPE OF WORK

The contractor will select eight pediatric practices with appropriate diversity to conduct case studies to better understand the implementation, evaluation and dissemination of evidence-based strategies to improve parental supervision and monitoring.  The supervision and monitoring strategies should asset-focused and be based on A Guide to Safety Counseling in Office Practice, Connected Kids:  Safe, Strong, Secure.  

The primary purpose of the initial case studies (Phase I)  will be to determine the key factors associated with successful implementation of evidence based strategies to improve parental monitoring and supervision. 

The primary purpose of the second round of case studies (Phase II) will be to evaluate the process by which the practices implement Connected Kids and identify barriers and facilitators to implementing this parental supervision and monitoring program.


IV.  TASKS TO BE PERFORMED

The vendor will provide all labor, materials, and equipment required to complete the tasks outlined below.  The vendor will require communication with CDC. 

1.  Meeting with CDC Project Officer to review workplan.

2.   One Day Planning Meeting  
Develop details of the approach (i.e., the plan for site visits) during a 1-day meeting of the project team and several pediatricians.  The project plan will be developed using initial findings from the current Parental Supervision and Monitoring Implementation Project (available through AAP).  The process will be flexible enough to allow what is learned in the first round of case studies to be rapidly incorporated in the second round. The contractor shall work with experts in quantitative and qualitative methods in violence prevention and other areas of health promotion.  

3.  PHASE I - Conduct preliminary case studies in 2 pediatric practices that have already implemented an evidence based strategy like Connected Kids.   Base the criteria for selection on success in implementing evidence based strategies and diversity.  The case studies in these practices should be conducted through site visits and information should be gathered from staff (physicians, non-physician clinicians, and non-clinical staff.) 

4.  Model - The contractor will use data from the preliminary case studies to develop a model for successful implementation which will then be applied in Phase II. Quantitative process measures should be developed based on the key aspects identified in the initial round of case studies.  Vendor will provide the model as part of progress report to the CDC for review and comment.

5. PHASE II - Conduct 6 additional case studies using the model.   
The new model shall be applied in case studies of 6 additional pediatric practices that have not yet begun to implement an evidence based strategy like Connected Kids.  Practices should be chosen to achieve some diversity with at least one practice of each of the following types:  small urban, small non-urban, large urban, large non-urban.  The contractor shall follow the practices throughout the process of implementation, with 2 site visits to each practice, one at the beginning of implementation during training and the other after several months of implementation. 

6.  Final Report - The vendor will provide CDC with a final report that describes how the practices implemented Connected Kids and counseling on injury and violence prevention through parental supervision and monitoring, and identifies the characteristics associated with successful implementation.  The report should include the processes by which practices train their staff regarding use of the evidence-based strategy and how they connected to community resources, and the facilitators of and barriers to implementation.  The report should also identify any barriers to implementing Connected Kids and related counseling and how those barriers could be overcome.  The draft report should be submitted to CDC for review and comment and the final report will be revised according to CDC comments.  

 The authority for this sole source procurement is FAR part 6.302-1.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  Firms that believe they can provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 10 days from the publication date of this synopsis.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A)

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/


INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this contract is to fund and employ a Chief, Field Programs Division (FPD), to lead, manage, and directly supervise OTI's USPSC Regional Team Leaders (currently three: Africa, Asia Near East, and Latin America and the Caribbean) and OTI's Strategic Resources Team (SRT) which includes full time USPSC media and civilian rights advisors, as well as OTI's program personnel surge capacity, a group of approximately 20 intermittent USPSCs also known as the program bullpen.

OTI's Field Programs Division (FPD) effectively manages OTI country programs and field staff which includes all programming responsibilities and authorities, assessments, start-ups and close outs of OTI country programs.  The FPD also provides expertise and technical support to both OTI Washington and to all country programs, and spearheads OTI's strategic engagement in intra/inter-agency sector-specific dialog and debate, enhancing OTI's ability to actively engage in discussions on matters critical to OTI program objectives.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of this recruitment is to select a single individual to act as a focal point for OTI field programs, fulfilling the duties and responsibilities described in this document.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The Chief of Field Programs Division (FPD) will be based in Washington, DC and will report to the Deputy Director of DCHA/OTI or his/her designee.  The Chief of FPD is a member of OTI's Senior Leadership Team, and is OTI's expert on matters and issues related to program planning and implementation and the use of Transition Initiative funds for programs overseas.

The Chief of FPD is a senior level position requiring experience in supervisory management, program management, international development, and international political analysis.  The individual must have the presence, knowledge, leadership, interpersonal and organizational skills to manage individuals and teams, oversee worldwide transition programs, and advocate and articulate OTI's mission to all levels of USAID, other USG agencies, host country officials and non-governmental individuals and groups.  While the individual must be able to make decisions independently, h/she must also be able to manage decisions as leader of a team.  The incumbent serves as the OTI Senior Leadership Team's principal expert on OTI program implementation issues.  A majority of the duties listed below are related to management and supervision of program activities and program funded personnel.

SCOPE OF WORK

INTRODUCTION:
The purpose of this contract is to produce and install educational signage at beaches and fishing areas in 19 coastal municipalities in Puerto Rico.  The contractor will also assist NOAA Fisheries in coordinating workshops in coastal municipalities to educate residents regarding fishing regulations and marine resources.  Through the installation of signs at beaches and fishing areas, NOAA Fisheries will work with the municipalities to inform the public about the marine resources found in the area, regulations for their protection, and fishing regulations.  This effort is part of a larger project to create partnerships with the coastal municipalities in Puerto Rico through educational programs and other cooperative efforts in order to educate the residents and visitors in the municipalities regarding the importance of our marine resources.  The project has been identified as a priority in the Puerto Rico Local Action Strategy (LAS) Overfishing theme.  Specifically, the work described herein will result in the completion of the LAS Overfishing project entitles, ?Create partnerships with coastal municipalities through their educational programs to inform the public and users of the importance of fisheries regulations.? 

BACKGROUND:
During the October 2002 U.S. Coral Reef Task Force (CRTF) meeting in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and a resolution was passed to improve implementation of the National Action Plan to Conserve Coral Reefs (NAP).  Four impediments to its implementation were identified as the need to identify threat-based priorities and key actions, the lack of coordination among government agencies, the need to track progress in terms of achievement of the NAP?s goals and objectives, and the need to increase support of entities involved in coral reef conservation efforts.  The resolution recommended addressing six focal areas for priority action, including overfishing, lack of awareness, recreational overuse, land-based pollution, coral bleaching and climate change, and coral diseases.  LAS?s were proposed for development in each geographic area represented by the CRTF for each focal area.

A lack of knowledge about fishing regulations, especially due to recent changes in local and federal regulations related to the catch of reef species, has been identified as a priority area for educating the public in Puerto Rico.  In coastal municipalities, especially those with recreational and/or commercial fishing associations and organizations, the strain on the coastal marine systems is larger due to the focus on coral reef species.  This project will increase communication between municipal governments and the residents of these municipalities, as well as between local and federal government entities.

This project is being initiated as a component of NOAA Fisheries? efforts on behalf of the Coral Reef Task Force established by President Clinton in June 1998 through Executive Order #13089.  The Executive Order, identified as Coral Reef Protection, seeks to ?preserve and protect the biodiversity, health, heritage, and social and economic value of U.S. coral reef ecosystems and marine environment.?

SCOPE:
Start date: Date of award 
End date: September 30, 2008

In order to meet the objective of this contract the contractor shall complete the work in three distinct phases: Coordination with NOAA Fisheries and coastal municipalities to determine number, location and content of signs; design and installation of signs; and coordination of workshops.  Short-term results will consist of the completion of workshops with coastal communities and the installation of signs along the shoreline of various coastal municipalities.  Long-term results will consist of an increase in public awareness related to the importance of marine resources in coastal municipalities around Puerto Rico and regulations related to the protection of these resources, which will lead to better conservation.
 
In order for this project to be completed all of the technical tasks described in this document should be done within the established timeframe.  The contractor should report any problem or complication that may arise during the realization of each task that could affect the timetable.
 
APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS:
Information regarding NOAA?s CRCP, the Coral Reef Task Force, and Local Action Strategies can be found on the internet at http://www.coralreef.noaa.gov.  A copy of Executive Order #13089 can be viewed at http://www.coralreef.gov/taskforce/pdf/executive_order13089.pdf.

TECHNICAL TASKS:
In order to meet the objectives of this contract, the contractor shall complete the work in three distinct phases:  Coordination with NOAA Fisheries and coastal municipalities to determine number, location and content of signs; design and installation of signs; and coordination of workshops.
 
	Task I. Coordination with NOAA Fisheries and Municipalities

The contractor will coordinate with NOAA Fisheries and coastal municipalities that have expressed an interest in workshops and the placement of signs along the coasts of their municipalities in areas containing boat ramps, public beaches, and fishing areas.  NOAA Fisheries developed questionnaires and circulated them among coastal municipalities as a means to identify which ones are interested in participating in conservation efforts.  Approximately 19 municipalities expressed interest in receiving talks and/or installing educational signage.  The contractor shall work with NOAA Fisheries and the municipalities to determine the type, number, etc. of the signs to be installed and educational activities to be completed in each municipality.

	Task II. Design and Installation of Signs

Based on the response from coastal municipalities to inquiries made by NOAA Fisheries, we estimate that 19 municipalities will participate in this project.  For those municipalities requesting signs related to the fishing regulations, we anticipate that 15 signs measuring approximately 20 inches by 26 inches would be required in total.  For those municipalities requesting signs related to the coastal resources within the municipality, we anticipate that 30 signs measuring approximately 36 by 36 inches would be required in total.  However, the final size and amount of signs will vary based on the results of Task 1 and available fund.  All signs will be full color and will need to withstand outdoor placement.

Task III. Coordination of Workshops

The contractor will be responsible for assisting NOAA Fisheries with the coordination of workshops with the local communities within the coastal municipalities.  The themes of the workshops will be developed in coordination with each municipality.  For those municipalities that have education programs, workshops could be developed to assist the municipalities work toward developing education strategies related to marine conservation.  Final decisions regarding the number and type of workshops will be made based on the results of Task 1 and available funds.  NOAA Fisheries anticipates that activities for the 19 coastal municipalities that expressed interest in workshops could be combined based on the location of the interested municipalities in relation to one another.  NOAA Fisheries anticipates that a minimum of 10 workshops or similar activities will be held for this project.

Once workshops and sign installations are complete, the contractor shall submit a final report detailing project accomplishments to NOAA Fisheries in the form of 4 hard copies and 6 electronic copies.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS / SOLICITATION NOTICE.   This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format of FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   

The reference solicitation number is:   NHLBI-PB(HL)-2007-206P-DCH

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA), intend to award a single, fixed priced contract for the purchase of the Cardiovascular Computer Tomography Imaging Scanner.

Background Information - The Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics has taken a leading role in developing advanced cardiac imaging methods, noninvasive physiological studies, and minimally invasive interventional procedures.  This work has included some of the first demonstrations of functional brain imaging, discovery of magnetization transfer contrast in NMR experiments, development and validation of new MR imaging methods, use of NMR and optical spectroscopy to study in vivo physiology, invention of novel two photon optical microscopy methods, and study of some of the first uses of MRI to guide intravascular catheter-based procedures and robotic surgery.  The Laboratory of Cardiac Energetics is staffed by a large team of physiologists, engineers, physicists, and physicians spanning a wide range of interests ranging from subcellular metabolism to human diagnostic imaging and catheter-based interventions.  

Computed Tomography is an x-ray based technology that produces noninvasive cross-sectional images of the body.  The advent of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scanners enabled acquisition of high resolution 3-dimensional images of the body when married with helical scan methods.  The value of the resulting high resolution images has been recognized by many groups around the world as providing high enough resolution images to diagnose coronary artery stenosis in patients.  This methodology is useful in a wide range of cardiovascular applications including noninvasive angiography, imaging heart valves and the pericardium.  One disadvantage of current generation MDCT scanners is the limited spatial coverage of the detectors.  Typically, 64-detector scanners cover 4 or less cm along the axial direction of the body.  To produce the highest quality images of the body, helical scanning modes are used which frequently use 80% overlap between each rotation to guarantee adequate spatial coverage and minimize image artifacts.  This increases radiation exposure and reduces temporal efficiency.

Objectives - This contract requires delivery of a detector CT scanner and installation that meet the requirements below, which will also require room renovations, in the NIH Heart Center at Suburban Hospital.  This equipment purchase will support pre-clinical and clinical research using high resolution CT scans to study myocardial perfusion, myocardial viability, coronary calcium, coronary artery stenosis, catheter-based interventions, and robotic surgery.

Services to be Performed.  General Requirements - Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services and perform the work set forth below.

All work under this contract shall be monitored by the Project Officer, whose position is defined elsewhere in this contract.

Specific Requirements - The contractor shall be responsible for delivering, installing, providing maintenance and training for a MDCT scanner.

Mandatory Specifications - The instrument must be a detector capable of acquiring 256 rows of data simultaneously for reconstruction into 3-dimensional CT images of the body whereby 11cm of the body can be imaged in half of a rotation around the body.  The range shall be large enough to cover many organs such as the brain and the heart within a half rotation of the scanner.  

Gantry rotation time is specified to be at least: 400ms indicating that cardiac images can be obtained with half rotation times of approximately 200ms.

MDCT Scanner Specifications - The system will include all hardware and software necessary to acquire and reconstruct images for a wide range of applications including but not limited to coronary calcium, contrast enhanced CT coronary angiography , angiography of other blood vessels, chest, brain, body, and other general CT applications.

The contractor shall provide a maintenance team to handle high density workload during this period of performance. The contractor shall complete system refurbishment required to bring systems back to operational status.  Refurbishment is required because o f extraordinary system usage and environmental conditions encountered in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).

The RQ-11 system consists of air vehicles, ground control station, remote video terminal and ground support equipment.  The RQ-11 was purchased by the Government as a non-developmental item and the Government owns no rights to the technical data or the software for the system.  Currently there is a single contractor performing this effort.   See Note 22                  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.

13.	What is the contract vehicle that you will be using for this effort, and what labor rate schedule will you be using for this effort? 
The contract will be a firm-fixed priced contract.  As stated in the solicitation the cost of the services must include all cost.
14.	Is there a funding ceiling for this effort?
Additional clarification is needed from the vendor in order to respond to this question. 



One question:  The solicitation states a preference for professionals having Black Belt certification. Does the CCR recognize that registration as a Professional Engineer in industrial engineering greatly surpasses the knowledge test presented by Black Belt recognition?  The consultant should be familiar with all improvement methodologies  . . . not just Lean and Six Sigma.  


ANSWER:  The solicitation does NOT require or prefer Black or Green Belt certification in Six Sigma or Lean Six Sigma by bidders.  Bidders, should however, have experience and knowledge applying, analyzing, and evaluating process improvement methodologies in the pubic sector.  


?	Are any existing process maps complete or will this be done during the performance period. 

ANSWER: These will be completed during the performance period by the contractor with input and assistance from appropriate agency staff, as determined necessary by the contractor. 

The agency does not have process maps for its national office reporting production.  It does have, however, written internal policies that identify the required ?high-level? milestones (e.g., approvals of various work plans and report drafts by the agency?s governing body, and other internal reviews needed to ensure report quality) involved in completing a national office report. Mapping should identify how these ?higher-level? milestones can be accomplished within a 12 to 18-month window, and assist the responsible office(s) in identifying and mapping the specific ?lower-level? or day-to-day project planning/management activities required to meet the ?higher-level? milestones.  

No process map exists for re-chartering state advisory committees (SAC).  The agency has a written internal policy that establishes timelines for submitting SAC packages for review and approval. For example, agency policy requires that re-charter packages be approved within 60-days of the end of the last SAC charter.  There is no policy (or process map) that provides step-by-step information on what actions must take place, and when they must be completed, in order to reach this 60-day requirement. 

?	Will the proper SME?s  be available for approximately one week to complete current state process maps and aid in the future state process mapping.

ANSWER: Yes, the needed subject matter experts (and others as necessary) will be made available as required by the contractor.  Meetings (as described in the solicitation), conference calls, telephone calls, email, and use of facsimile should ensure that needed staff is available. Access to all relevant documents, policies, and guidance will be promptly provided.   

?	Does CCR plan on using any existing electronic payment methods for the Vendor/Consultant. 

ANSWER: The contractor must mail hardcopy of invoice to address provided.  Payments will be disbursed electronically from Treasury.

?	Might there be extensions to implement the future state process. 

ANSWER: We have no plans at this time for contracting of the implementation of the deliverable work process maps/plans.

Response 003

1.	Although we fully appreciate the need for accomplishing the task in a timely fashion and are willing and capable to complete the task in the timeframe provided, please elaborate on how the timeline will work.  
a.	How much latitude will there be with completing the project within 45 days of award given the reliance on schedules of Commission Leadership and Process Improvement Team?   Agency leadership has made timely completion of this project by the contractor a Commission priority. This has been, and will continue to be, communicated to the appropriate staff.  Should, however, delays resulting from the lack of availability and responsiveness of Commission staff make it impossible to complete this contract within 45 days after award, the Commission will be flexible in working with the contractor to establish a new timeline acceptable to both parties.  Availability and responsiveness issues must be promptly reported by the contractor to the COTR (or designee). 
b.	Will Commission Leadership and the Process Improvement Team be available immediately upon granting award for the orientation and training?  Yes.  Leadership and staff have been asked to reserve 3 alternate sets of days beginning in early September for this purpose. 
2.	Section A, 1st bullet:  it indicates that expert will use Lean Six Sigma methodologies to ?optimize the Commission?s process flow (?creating and/or formalizing agency processes?)? ? what does Commission consider as formalizing?  It should be noted that acceptable methodologies are NOT limited to Lean Six Sigma.  "Formalizing" means analyzing and mapping effective and efficient informal practices. That is, step-by-step mapping of effective and efficient informal practices so that they can easily be incorporated into formal written agency policies and procedures.   
3.	Section A, 5th bullet:  Approximately what percent of the time will the Process Improvement Team be available to respond to questions, be interviewed, collect or provide relevant data? There is no set percentage of time.  However, agency leadership has made timely completion of this project by the contractor a Commission priority. This has been, and will continue to be, communicated to the appropriate staff. The contractor will be free to contact staff directly. In addition, the contractor, following orientation, should provide a work plan or other guidance to the COTR to help facilitate and ensure that staff is available when needed by the contractor.  
4.	Section A, 5th bullet:  Please clarify your concept for collecting relevant data. Will the Process Improvement Team be available to collect the data based upon the operational definitions developed in conjunction with the expert, Commission, and Process Improvement Team?  Currently, the agency tracks and reports performance data related to cost, timeliness, and staff time. Additional data collection needed to measure the current and future effectiveness and efficiency of the two functions undergoing process improvement should be identified by the contractor. Staff will be available to consult with and collect data.  
5.	Section A, 5th bullet:  What data has been collected, if any, that is available for analysis of the processes?  The Commission reports monthly on project costs, staff time usage, and project duration related to key program activities. It just recently began tracking SAC re-charter timeliness. 
a.	Is historical data available for the processes that indicates how much time is required to perform the process and problem areas or is it anecdotal? Limited historically data is available. All national reports are required to be completed within the 12-18 month timeframe.  However, there was no centralized data collection on actual timeliness until the last 2 years or so.  Moreover, new report production requirements, staff departures, and the loss of institutional memory have recently made the 12 to 18-month timeframe more challenging to attain. Only anecdotal evidence is available on this particular issue. 
b.	Do you have data that tells you currently what your baseline performance is, i.e., timeliness, cost, cycle time, for both processes? Performance measures for re-chartering of SACs were established in FY07 so there is no actual baseline performance data on timeliness.  FY07 will be the baseline year. National report information includes costs, staff usage, and duration.  

6. Approximately how many national office reports are produced per month?  Per quarter?  Report production is measured per fiscal year and, on average, there are between 4 and 6 reports completed per FY.  However, reports do span across fiscal years (e.g., a report began in mid-FY06 can be completed in mid- to late FY07). Each report is required to have a project timeline that marked milestones, start date, end date, actual v. target completion dates, and total completion time. Until recently, the agency used MS Project for report management.  
7. Under ?E. Travel? it indicates one staff consultation.  Our assumption is that we would be working with the Commission Leadership and the Process Improvement Team to identify the steps of the processes, measurements, and the improvement areas during that staff consultation period ? is length of this period to be determined by contractor? Yes, the length of the consultation period is to be determined by contractor in consultation with the COTR.  It is anticipated that the initial orientation and training will take place before the end of FY07 and should take between 1 1/2 to 2 days.  The orientation and training will include headquarters and regional office staff, including agency leadership and the improvement team members.  Consultation, separate from the orientation and training, may be an ongoing process that could include at least one meeting in D.C. but will rely primarily on virtual meetings (conference calls, etc.) with necessary agency staff.
 
8.	How many days follow-up support and other support as defined by the Commission are anticipated?  Between 20 and 40 hours of follow-up support related to drafting or revising new internal agency policies, as necessary, to support and/or implement the improvement plan developed by the contractor.  
 
9.	What type of Microsoft Office software is used by the Commission? 
a.	For graphs and charts? Excel 
b.	For process mapping?  None currently, though MS Project 1997 was previously used. The agency plans to invest in new project management software.   
 
10.	The oral status report as required in Section F is by teleconference as it is not covered under travel, correct? Correct.
 11Given the length of time it takes to complete a Re-Chartering or National Office Report Production process, how does the Commission anticipate evaluating results?Short-term or immediate factors will be used to evaluate potential effectiveness of contractor?s improvement plan.  These include: Whether the specific steps in the re-chartering process, and related timeframes, are clearly identified in the improvement plan? Whether the specific steps in the national office report production process, and related timeframes, are clearly identified in the improvement plan?  Whether the improvement plan supports achievement of agency strategic goals/objectives related to executing applicable procedural requirements, and meeting timeliness requirements established for SAC charters and national office report production? Whether the improvement plan is accessible, that is, is it written in plain language, incorporates performance measures, and identifies data needed by the agency to measure performance on an ongoing basis? Whether the improvement plan reflects a consideration of Commission staff input? Whether the improvement plan reflects a consideration of existing agency resources (i.e., is the improvement plan feasible and realistic based on agency staffing and funding)?     
12. What are the success criteria that the Commission is going to use? 
Long term agency performance measures of SAC process improvement successful include:  
?	What percentage of SAC charters incorporated performance of the specific steps, within their established timeframes, as mapped in the improvement plan? Target Performance: 85% performance target for FY08; 100% performance target for FY09.  
?	What percentage of SACs were chartered within the established timeframe of 60-days following charter expiration?  Target performance: 100% performance target for FY08.  
?	Was the average cost of SAC charters within the established range and/or average (i.e., baseline)? 
Long-term measures for national office report production process improvement success include:  
?	What percentage of national office reports were produced using the specific steps and timeframes as mapped in the improvement plan? Target performance: 90% performance target for FY08; 100% in FY09.  
?	What percentage of national office reports were completed within the established timeframe of no longer than 18-months following initiation?  Target Performance: 100% performance target in FY08.  
?	What percentage of national office reports were completed within budget? Target performance: 90% in FY08.

DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS (Attachment 1)

SUBJECT:  Brand Name Procurement (AM General 6.5 L Diesel Engine)

FINDINGS

1.  In accordance with (IAW) FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for purchases less than the SAT, the Contracting Officer may make a determination to solicit for ?brand name? only. Also,  IAW IG5306 in Air Force Contracting Guidelines, J&A is not required for purchases under procedures in FAR Part 13 (see above). Dollar amount on requirement does not expect to exceed the SAT.

2.  IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. To re-manufacture another equivalent (in performance) engine to fit the M1116 HMMWVs, a specific conversion kit would be required and would require excess costs by the contractor. In addition, due to the uniqueness of the HMMWVs (upright design, unlike most commercial Hummers), specifying the brand name of the engine is crucial to the Government in order to meet its needs.

4.  Rear mounted turbos for 6.5L Diesel Automobile engines are only obtainable by the AM General brand. A side mounted turbo will not be serviceable to the mission. 

DETERMINATION

Based on the findings above and IAW Air Force Instructions, it is hereby determined that a brand-name procurement for this requirement of AM General 6.5L Turbo (rear mounted) Diesel Engine is in the best interest of the Government.

DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS (Attachment 1)

SUBJECT:  Brand Name Procurement (AM General 6.5 L Diesel Engine)

FINDINGS

1.  In accordance with (IAW) FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for purchases less than the SAT, the Contracting Officer may make a determination to solicit for ?brand name? only. Also,  IAW IG5306 in Air Force Contracting Guidelines, J&A is not required for purchases under procedures in FAR Part 13 (see above). Dollar amount on requirement does not expect to exceed the SAT.

2.  IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. To re-manufacture another equivalent (in performance) engine to fit the M1116 HMMWVs, a specific conversion kit would be required and would require excess costs by the contractor. In addition, due to the uniqueness of the HMMWVs (upright design, unlike most commercial Hummers), specifying the brand name of the engine is crucial to the Government in order to meet its needs.

4.  Rear mounted turbos for 6.5L Diesel Automobile engines are only obtainable by the AM General brand. A side mounted turbo will not be serviceable to the mission. 

DETERMINATION

Based on the findings above and IAW Air Force Instructions, it is hereby determined that a brand-name procurement for this requirement of AM General 6.5L Turbo (rear mounted) Diesel Engine is in the best interest of the Government.

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment is to: 1) Change Buisness Classification to Total Small Business Set-Aside Only, 2) To incorporate a Revise Statement of Work, 3) All proposals must be submitted via email by 2:00 PM est on August 22, 2007, 4) Respond to questions and concerns submitted by potential bidders - 

1.	Is there a page limit to the proposal?    25 Pages
2.	Is there an incumbent performing these or similar services?  Yes,  Atek, Inc, Leesburg VA.
3.	Are the CAFM Data Specialists and the CAD Technician Specialists currently on staff? If so, how many of each are there?  
CAD Technician Specialists - All members of the Space Design and Alterations Team have PD's as Facilities Technical Specialists, 5 are "Design Focused" and can be considered Design and CAD Technician Specialists. 

CAFM Data Specialists -  Currently, we have no CAFM (Computer Aided Facilities Management) Specialists on staff. That function was filled by the prior CAFM data manager. However, in consultation with the prior CAFM Data Manager,  we have fulfilled certain tasks peripheral to and in support of the Facilities Center 7 Facilities System, including polylining drawings, updating drawing backgrounds per the CAD/FM standards, and updating room occupancy and personnel data on Excel spreadsheets in preparation for their upload into the FM system by the CAFM Data Manager.  

Training - 4 SDAT Team members are currently engaged in background training in anticipation of training and engagement with the CAFM system ( Archibus) in coordination with the CAFM Data Manager. This training includes Excel, SQL, and AutoCAD update training. 

Space Management - In the event that the Space Management function is to be performed by ORPS,  we  will need several additional staff solely for that function which, among other skills, are CAFM Data and CAD proficient.
4.	Has Archibus/FM been installed and configured?   NO, ORPS is currently in the process of procuring this software.   What version of Archibus/FM has been installed?  Version 16.
5.	Have all required licenses been purchased for the modules that the customer requires?  What is the current license structure? Not yet, we are currently in the process of procuring the software. The license structure will include Real Property and Lease, Overlay for AutoCAD with Design Management, Condition Assessment and Operations and Maintenance Management. 
Real Property and Lease?  Yes  
Overlay for AutoCAD with Design Management?  Yes  
Condition Assessment?   Yes 
Operations and Maintenance Management?  Yes 
6.	Has a software subscription been purchased for Archibus/FM?  Currently in the procurement process.   
7.	Are there any specific software suites that the customer requires Archibus/FM to be integrated with (examples: SAP, PeopleSoft)?  Throughout  the duration of the contract there may  be integration with the GSA Rentbill, the internal FDA Enterprise Administrative Support Environment (EASE) which is the personnel data system and the Employee Resource and Information Center (ERIC).  
8.	Do CAD Standards currently exist? Yes,  the Current FDA CAD Standards are based on the per FDA CAD Standards Manual, authored by and issued November 25, 2002 . These Standards are expected to be edited per the ORPS CAD group meetings in coordination with the CAFM Data Manager.
9.	What version of AutoCAD has been installed ?  We currently use Autodesk Architectural Desktop 2005, menu configured for AutoCAD 2005. Per recommendation of the prior CAFM data manager, we are planning to upgrade to AutoCAD Architecture 2008, menu configured to AutoCAD 2008, prior to the expected FDA implementation of the Archibus FM system.
10.	What is the current DHHS-FDA space inventory (in number of facilities and Square Feet) that is covered by this RFP?  366 constructed assets,  6.7 million square feet  
11.	11. Have standard operating procedures for the CAFM toolset been written?  The prior CAFM Data Manager developed and programmed his own customized, unique system for data interface between Facilities Center 7, the FDA CAD drawings, and the FDA EASE personnel data system. This system included 3rd party (Oracle) software as well as software written by the prior CAFM data manager. It is my expectation that the new CAFM Data Manager will need to create similar interfaces with the expected Archibus System.
12.	In what format would you like to see the cost proposal?  Divided into subtasks based on number of hours and the associated hourly rate.  In addition, include all applicable incidental  costs (i.e. travel).  
13.	Should other supporting skillsets be included as add-alternates?  We have capabilities that, while not specifically called out in the RFP, may be required.  The Contractor may add  additional skillsets that were not specifically called for in the RFP with all associated costs.  Provide information in the technical proposal to support these additional skill sets.     
14.	Have the evaluation criteria been identified?  If so, could you identify them and their weights toward the final proposal score?   Evaluation Criteria is attached to the revised Statement of Work. 
15.	 Should the r?sum? of the intended CAFM Data Manager be included?  Yes  
16.	Should a company r?sum? be included?  Yes  
17.	Is this a Small Business Set-Aside?  Are there any other requirements?  Total Small Business Set-Aside.
18.	What time of the day is the Proposal due?  August 22, 2007, 2:00 pm EST 
19.	Will electronic proposals be accepted?  If not how many hard copies are required?  Is the address listed in the solicitation (Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services, 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 2129, Rockville, MD, 20857-0001) the correct address for proposal delivery?  Are there any special instructions or requirements to gain access to the building to deliver the proposal?   Yes, Electronic Proposal will be accepted.  25 Page Limit.

21.	In Subtask #1, can you further define "Serve as an expert design consultant..."? We are evaluating experience and expertise in organizing real property data in a way that is conducive with the implementation of the  Archibus product in terms of in house personalization and customization.   
22.	Is DHHS-FDA providing the DBA, Programmers for the software integration?  FDA will use resources in terms of DBA and other IT assistance as needed throughout the project.

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.
