Gila Ridge Rd  for performance period of up to 5 years.  The anticipated value of the BPA is $25,000 for the 5 years.  For this acquisition, the North American Industrial Classification System Code is 327320 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  This acquisition is a total small business set aside.  It is anticipated that the BPA will be issued on or about October 1, 2007.   This is not a request for proposal, however, vendors who are able to provide similar service must submit their technical capabilities to include technical specifications, past performance information and price with delivery time.  The supply must meet ASTM guidelines, 4,000 psi concrete mix.  This information will be reviewed by the Government Technical Representative for consideration for future requirements.

Registration can be accomplished through the World Wide Web at http//www.ccr.gov.   Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  The CCR Handbook and information on the registration process can be obtained via the CCR website, http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.    Offerors will be required to complete the annual representation and certification electronically via the Online Representation and Certification Application (ORCA) website at http://orca.bnp.gov.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Network Appliance hardware to complete the SAN Storage Upgrade.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  (2) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs (including the estimated value): CA/CST/II requires the purchase of Network Appliance hardware to complete the SAN Storage Upgrade.  As part of CA/CST’s migration from CLASS to eCLASS, CST purchased and installed 4 Storage Area Networks (SANs) from Network Appliances (NetApp).  A recent redesign of the eCLASS architecture has led to an increase in its SAN storage requirements. ) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. (4) 	A demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The currently installed Network Appliance SANs contain proprietary hardware, which require the use of DS14MK2 storage shelves from Network Appliance, to integrate correctly with the existing SAN platform and expand its capacity.  No other vendor’s disk storage shelf would be compatible with our existing installed hardware.  Because this equipment must interface with existing specialized IT equipment, no other manufacturer’s product will fulfill the requirement.  In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Network Appliance SAN Storage Upgrade without delay.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Subject synopsis is to cover requirements for the MV-22 for Spares and Repairs, and for the CV-22 Spares thru 30 September 2008.  The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.  Only the sources previously approved by the government for these items have been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the "https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm" U.S Navy Aviation Supply Office Source Approval Information Brochure.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have n!  ever made.  This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVICP-P at (215)697-4243.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.  The NAVICP Commercial Item Identification Brochure is now available at: https://www.neco.navy.mil.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to inform industry of an opportunity to provide comments on the Facilities Development & Operations Contract (FDOC) resulting from this strategy.  Please submit your comments directly to the Contracting Officer, J.R. Carpentier, via the email identified in this synopsis no later than October 24, 2007. The Mission Operations Directorate (MOD) at NASA/JSC has developed a procurement strategy to restructure its support contracts in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 timeframe.  Part of this restructure is anticipated to result in the FDOC which is anticipated to be awarded on the basis of full and open competition.  FDOC is designed to afford the opportunity for life cycle cost savings through synergy and competition and better align support contracts with a new organizational structure. Part of the requirements for FDOC will come from a de-scoping of certain facilities work currently part of the Space Program Operations Contract (SPOC), NNJ06VA01C.  Other requirements will come from work that has been performed under the Mission Support Operations Contract (MSOC), NAS 9-03056, that provides sustaining and operations services for the mission control and planning systems.  The remaining requirements envisioned for FDOC will be new requirements which are not yet under contract. Facility Development & Operations Contract (FDOC) FDOC services include the development, sustaining engineering, operations, and maintenance of multiple MOD facilities supporting training, flight design, flight planning, reconfiguration, and real-time operations for the current human space flight programs—Space Shuttle, International Space Station (ISS), and Constellation.  Additionally, FDOC will provide the development and sustaining of user software applications supporting the above functions.  The FDOC is anticipated to have a period of performance of at least 5 years. A forthcoming notice will be posted to the MOD contract strategy website to announce an Industry Day.  Definition of the work that is currently performed under SPOC and MSOC, to be realigned into the facilities contract, can be found in the applicable Statements of Work.  Please see the following website for more information: http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/fdoc/default.asp     The NAICS Code and Size Standard for the facilities contract is 541710 and 1,000 employees, respectively. The Anticipated Schedule can be viewed at: http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/fdoc/schedule.htm  The Government is seeking input on how to best implement the strategies outlined above.  Parties are asked to provide specific information on:  1)	Strategies to reduce the operational cost of control center, training, and reconfiguration facilities for both ISS and Constellation Programs. 2)	The optimal contract type, including feasibility of using a fixed-price contract for FDOC. 3)	How best to integrate the dependencies between SPOC, the Integrated Mission Operations Contract (see synopsis NNJ07221364R-A) for plan/train/fly (PTF) requirements, and facilities contractor teams. 4)	What documents should be available on the MOD contract strategy website or in an online technical library to facilitate future competitions. 5)	Streamlining the procurement process to meet the contract award date.

<SUBJECT>A--MISSION OPERATIONS DIRECTORATE "MOD" CONTRACTS --  INTEGRATED MISSION OPERATIONS CONTRACT "IMOC"
<SOLNBR>NNJ07221364R-A
<RESPDATE>102407
<ARCHDATE>09242008
<CONTACT>Billy E. Perry, Contracting Officer, Phone 281-244-1794, Fax 281-483-6919, Email billy.e.perry@nasa.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to inform industry of NASA’s intent to award a sole source contract for the Integrated Mission Operations Contract (IMOC).  The Mission Operations Directorate (MOD) at NASA/JSC has developed a procurement strategy to restructure its support contracts in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 timeframe.  MOD has determined that this restructuring will result in a new contract, IMOC, which would be awarded to United Space Alliance (USA) on a sole source basis.	This contract is designed to aid in the retention of the Space Shuttle Program (SSP) workforce through the end of the program, to enable cross utilization of resources across all programs, and to provide seamless operations support for the International Space Station (ISS) Program. USA has been the incumbent contractor for MOD flight operations services since being formed in 1995 giving them a unique and intimate knowledge of human spaceflight operations, capabilities and processes.  The USA workforce has critical skills that need to be utilized not only to continue support of the SSP and ISS programs but also to support the new Constellation Program. Continuing with USA through shuttle retirement will aid in workforce retention and vendor-base stability during the transition from Shuttle to Constellation, helping mitigate any impacts to a program philosophy of “last flight as safe as first flight.”  Failure to maintain a stable and continuous workforce at USA would have severe and serious impacts to the safety of the SSP and ISS Programs, and the success of the Constellation Program.  IMOC would come from the addition of work not currently authorized in the Space Program Operations Contract (SPOC), NNJ06VA01C, which provides flight operations, training and facilities services that are necessary to conduct mission operations preparation and execution for the SSP and ISS.	A portion of the effort for IMOC would involve moving the MOD provisioning items supporting the Constellation Program from SPOC to IMOC.	IMOC would also include technical support to MOD for Constellation development.  In addition, support of the ISS would transition to IMOC after SPOC ends in 2010.  IMOC will provide MOD flight operations services to both the ISS and Constellation Programs. Specifically, these services include: •	Flight analysis  •	Flight design •	Vehicle consumables evaluation •	Mission timelines and procedures development •	Crew and flight controller curriculum development and training conduct •	Mission operations (preflight planning, flight operations, post flight  support activities) •	Operations concept development •	Flight rules and constraints •	Technical specification generation and assessment •	Design evaluation The period of performance of IMOC is intended to be from October 1, 2008 until September 30, 2011 with a one-year option to September 30, 2012.	 The NAICS Code and Size Standard for IMOC is 541710 and 1,000 employees, respectively.  The anticipated release date of the IMOC RFP is February, 2008. The anticipated proposal due date for IMOC is April, 2008. An ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".  The Government does not intend to acquire a commerical item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  The URL for the NASA/JSC Business Opportunities page is: http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=73	  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. All contractual and technical questions must be submitted in writing (e-mail or FAX) to Billy Perry at billy.e.perry@nasa.gov no later than 12 noon, Central Time, October 24, 2007.  Telephone questions will not be accepted.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Enhancement and Integration of  NASGRO and FASTRAN software NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the services from Southwest Research Institute for the following reason: Southwest Research Institute has an existing Space Act Agreement in place with NASA to be the primary provider and developer of the NASGRO software through maintaining the NASGRO Consortium, which is a collection of government and industrial partners that utilize the software.  Based on the existing legal framework of the Space Act Agreement, it is impractical to have any entity other than Southwest Research Institute perform the subject development and integration activities for the NASGRO software.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 9/27/07.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>Request for Comment.               
Sources Sought/Request for Capabilities Statements.


TSA seeks to establish a baseline to identify and assess public antiterrorism awareness accomplishments achieved to date throughout the United States.  A comprehensive examination of antiterrorism awareness campaigns currently in place for the passenger rail and intra-city bus industries is needed and gaps must be identified.  Then TSA must identify ways to mitigate these gaps to enhance passenger and employee awareness regarding terrorist activities, and assist in the identification of measures the passenger rail and intra-city bus industries and TSA can undertake to enhance transportation security.

The purpose of this RFI is to: (1) solicit comment on the attached draft Statement of Work, and (2) identify potential bidders based on capability statements.
Responses to this RFI shall include:
1.	Comments directed at improving the attached Statement of Work and approach.
2.	A Capability Statement, including:
a.	A suggested timeline and milestones for the effort.
b.	Indication of business size status.
Submissions are restricted to no more than ten (10) pages in length.

Offerors in their capability statement should describe at a minimum their expertise and experience in efforts related or similar to those described in the Statement of Work.  Responses are required to include the firm name, mailing address, telephone and facsimile numbers, company web site, size of firm, number of years providing representative research and analysis work, and direct points of contact including phone and e-mail addresses.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.     Additionally, the Government WILL NOT provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI.  The results of this RFI will be used in the development of the final Request for Proposal, and will be used in assembling a bidders list to which the final RFP will be sent.
TSA intends to either set aside this effort as a small business limited competition or establish it as an 8(a) set-aside.     However, should no qualified small business respond to this RFI, this effort would be opened to large businesses.     (It should be noted that TSA accepts Mentor-Prot?g? relationships.)
All information in response to this RFI shall be submitted no later than October 15, 2007 to the following email address: James.Loba@dhs.gov .  Please note that the collection of this data does not obligate the Government to the incorporation of the solicited comments nor does it obligate the Government to the procurement of the services.

DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United State (U.S.) Government intends to purchase the Unlimited Legal Rights to the engineering and technical data contained in the Interface Control Drawings (ICD) for M61 family of gun systems and related equipment. All technical data is intended for internal and external use and competition actions by the U.S Government.  The ICD will portray and explain all critical phases and constraints of the successful handling of 20MM ammunition throughout M61 family guns and related systems. The ICD will define a status for the F-15, F-16, F/A-18, F/A-22, and Mark-15 CIWS gun systems that employ the M61 family of guns.  Using these documents as a reference, engineers will be able to understand every aspect of handling 20mm ammunition thus minimizing the probability of interference issues in the years to come. At this time, according to the most current market research, General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products (GD-ATP) is only known source to the U.S. Government which owns the most current technical drawings that could satisfy the requirement describe above.   **The purpose of this amendment to the synopsis is to state this effort has been determined to be Urgent and Compelling in accordance with the policy set forth within FAR 6.302-2. There will not be a formal solicitation posted at the Government Point of Entry regarding this effort.

This project replaces the remote monitoring  and control system, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), for  the primary electrical power distribution system located at WPAFB. This  system consists of power sensors, relays, remote terminal units, and the  interconnecting control conductors in 9 substations located throughout the  base. It also consists of a front end computer system located in one  central facility along with other remote monitoring sites. This project  requires very specialized equipment and computer programming to result in  a fully functional SCADA system.  The SCADA system monitors the entire  primary electrical distribution system, and allows for complete control of  that system. The scope will also include associated architectural, civil,  structural, mechanical, plumbing, electrical and miscellaneous work as  shown on the project drawings and described in the specifications. NAICS  Code 238210 Size Standard $13.0 Million. The overall estimated price range  is between $1M and $5M. Period of Performance is 365 days.

Registration may be accomplished  at http://www.ccr2000.com/index.cfm, or 1-888-CCR-2423 Fax:  1-703-696-0213. SCOPE OF WORK:  This project renovates the interior and installs fire  suppression that doesn’t currently exist.  It includes complete  replacement of the HVAC and electrical systems.  The fire alarm is so  outdated it cannot be repaired and requires replacement.  The requirement  for fire suppression/detection carries an FSD 3.  The renovation will  correct life safety deficiencies such as a conference room with inadequate  egress.  The project will reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient  use of space. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: No fire suppression currently exists and  fire alarms are unreliable.  Work is necessary to bring the Wing  Headquarters building into compliance with Life Safety Code, Handicapped  Access and to reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient use of space.  HVAC and electrical systems require revitalization due to age and addition  of ADP equipment.  HVAC has failed on several occasions requiring  temporary heaters and A/C to be brought in until repairs could be made.  The system has been repaired several times but is not expected to be  reliable in the future.  The mechanical system will remain in operation to  serve the first floor.  The first floor will remain occupied by the Wing  Command Section and ASC/JA during construction.  This will require the  contractor to provide temporary rigging for the demolition and material  delivery.  All first floor accesses will have to be maintained during the  construction.  There will be numerous occasions where the contractor will  need to stop performing work to accommodate special events and  distinguished visitors. NOTES: 1.

Update 10 July 2007: The synopsis is revised as follows: the final solicitation will be issued without further notice in September 2007 and that contract award is estimated for December 2007. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWARSYSCOM), on behalf of the Program Executive Office (PEO) for Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I), Command and Control Program Office (PMW 150), intends to release Request For Proposals (RFP) number N00039-07-R-0027 for the procurement of Multi-Functional Information Distribution System (MIDS) On Ship (MOS) and associated Link-16 systems. This procurement, originally synopsized 25 October 2005 on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website under solicitation number N00039- 05-R-0046, was suspended indefinitely via the synopsis modification dated 03 April 2006 to enable further assessment of requirements. The current synopsis has been revised to reflect updated requirements. Five (5) distinct configurations of the MOS System may be ordered: 1) High Power MOS System (HPMOS) for shipboard application; 2) Low Power MOS System (LPMOS) for shipboard application; 3) HPMOS System equipped with commercial crypto for shipboard application; 4) LPMOS System equipped with commercial crypto for shipboard application; and 5) High Power Radio Terminal Set intended for use in non-shipboard applications.

All system configurations delivered shall utilize MIDS Low Volume Terminals (LVTs), provided as Government Furnished Property (GFP) via the Joint Program Executive Officer (JPEO) for Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), MIDS International Program Office (JTRS 10).  The scope of this contract also includes requirements for Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), spares, maintenance and repair, documentation, configuration management, and engineering. The Government anticipates a competitive award of a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  Individual delivery/task orders will be awarded on a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) basis for MOS systems and spares and on a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) basis for services. The basic contract will establish minimum and maximum ordering quantities. The prospective contract will have one (1) one-year base ordering period and four (4) one-year option ordering periods. This is a full and open competition. The final solicitation will be issued without further notice in June 2007 and will be available to interested parties, along with any amendments issued, solely on the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website (https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil/). The MOS System Performance Specification (SPS) will be available in CD format once the solicitation is issued.  A Bidders Mailing List will not be established, and hard copies of documents will not be provided. Contract award is estimated for October 2007. This procurement will require the large business offerors to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan demonstrating efforts to provide subcontracting opportunities for Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Business and other Small Business concerns.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND:

LATA/Parallax Portsmouth LLC (LPP) was awarded a Department of Energy (DOE) Prime Contract for Remediation, D&D, and Legacy Waste Disposition activities at the DOE Portsmouth GDP Facility (PORTS) in Piketon, OH. The requirements of this work scope involve the treatment and offsite disposition of multiple mixed waste streams that may be generated during the execution of these activities.

SCOPE:  

LPP requires a subcontractor(s) to provide all necessary personnel, facilities, materials, licenses, and permits necessary to receive, store, treat, and/or dispose, as appropriate, Low Level Radioactive Mixed Waste (LLMW) shipped from the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant. 

The waste to be covered by and addressed, as part of this Statement of Work, is mixed wastes, defined as low-level radioactive wastes mixed with Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) waste. The potential exists for the generation of wastes in virtually any RCRA Waste Code. However, the primary RCRA characterization is for toxicity as a result of heavy metal content, or listed hazardous wastes such as TCE, TCA, or other organics. The primary radioactive contaminants are uranium-235 (U-235) and technetium-99 (Tc-99). 

Additionally, the need for treatment and/or disposal of low-level radioactive wastes mixed with wastes contaminated with materials controlled under the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA), primarily polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and asbestos containing materials. (ACM).

Treatment is sought to meet the requirements of 40 CFR 268, specifically those of 40 CFR 268.43, to assure that mixed wastes meet land disposal restriction (LDR) requirements. Disposal of LDR compliant mixed wastes and mixed wastes treated to meet LDR requirements, or wastes treated to no longer be considered MLLW is also sought. 

Classified waste streams are not included in the scope of this work.

 The waste covered by this scope of work will be disposed of in an appropriate waste cell dependent on end state characterization. Wastes to be treated and/or disposed may include liquid, solid, and sludge waste streams. 

The solids will include, but will not be limited to, personal protective equipment, radiation shielding, process equipment, wood, filters, soil, building rubble, concrete, metals, and glass, generated as a result of D&D activities of former DOE process buildings. It will also include investigation derived wastes and removal action wastes associated with environmental remediation activities.

The sludge and liquid waste streams are generally derived from the treatment of ground water, decontamination fluids and solutions, and some process streams.

Testing would be performed to ascertain and compare the life cycle durability of two devices from independent sources being considered for use in USPS Mail Delivery Vehicles. The devices are Mail Stowage and Retrieval Systems installed to enhance mail management and delivery methods in the delivery vehicle. Two competing system prototypes would be subjected to durability testing and the results would help the USPS in selecting the superior system. The selected system would proceed to crash testing to ensure that the vehicle operator is not exposed to any safety risks in a head-on crash due to system design or installation method. 




The test supplier should be capable of developing and performing a durability test that would simulate ten years of field usage (forty miles per day at six days per week, fifty-two weeks per year). Test supplier should be capable of performing vibration, bounce, torsional twist and Arizona dust and salt spray testing. Test supplier should be capable of performing accelerated testing with a duration not to exceed three months. Test supplier should be capable of testing in both ambient and extreme temperature conditions ranging from -20 through 120 degrees Fahrenheit in a controlled environment. Test supplier should be capable of performing system component cycle testing. At the conclusion of the durability test, supplier should provide a test report for each system tested. 




The test supplier should be capable of performing a 30 mile per hour frontal barrier crash test of a delivery vehicle equipped with a stowage system loaded with 738 pounds of mail. Crash testing should conform to the Fixed Barrier Collision standard CBP-ST-14 dated March 3, 1998. The goal is to determine if the system remains secured to the cargo area and no parts of the system become loose and capable of injuring the driver or damaging the mail. At the conclusion of the crash test, supplier should provide a report of the test that includes photographs and high speed video from multiple camera positions including the vehicle interior. Report should also include vehicle condition and crash data. 




The objective of this notice is to identify potential sources interested and capable of performing the required vehicle testing services.  This is a request for information only and is not a solicitation to purchase services.  




To be identified as a potential source, please email the following information to Delores Waters at delores.b.waters@usps.gov:



1. Your company name, address, telephone number(s) and email
   address.
2. Name of company point of contact.
3. Brief description of your company vehicle testing
   capabilities.

<DESC>This is a notification that the Social Security Admistration (SSA) intends to procure the following telephone services from Comm-Works (dba Fortran) of Falls Church, Virginia. The Southeastern Program Service Center (SEPSC) is moving from 2001 12th Street to 1200 8th Street in Birmingham, Alabama.  The move will take place over a 6 month period beginning in December 2007.  The SEPSC currently obtains it telephone service through an on-site Fujitsu 9600XL digital switching system which is under a maintenance agreement with Comm-Works.  A telephone system must be in place in the new location in advance of the move to accommodate 2,000 employees.  The contractor must purchase and install 4 additional Fujitsu 9600XL PBX cabinets to extend the PBX to the new building and eventually transfer all telephones and telephone service to the new building.  Service from the existing telephone system must be extended to the new building while maintaining service in both buildings.  The contractor will plan and coordinate with Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) for the network design, install the required telecommunications facilities, reconfigure the existing system to free up cards that can be used in the system in the new building and reconfigure the existing system to accept 4 unchannelized T1 lines that must be added to the system database via the SITEMAN system management product.  SITEMAN is a Comm-Works patented product that only a SITEMAN certified technician can access.  Any vendor who submits information for this requirement must provide evidence that they are certified to use the SITEMAN system. This is a notice of intent and solicitation will no be issued.  SSA will not respond to request for solicitation copies and will not pay for information received in response to this announcement.  Responders must provide sufficient information for SSA to determine that a firm other than Comm-Works can provide the above services.  If SSA does not receive an acceptable response within 5 days of this publication, it will commence negotiations with Comm-Works with the intent of issuing it a delivery order for the service.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS / REQUEST FOR INFORMATION GENESIS Logistics, Engineering and Facilities Support Contract (Sensors) Fort Belvoir, VA 24 September 2007 This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis/Request for Information for the US Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) GENESIS logistics, engineering and facilities support contract. 1.  Purpose.  The US Army Intelligence and Security Command is planning to conduct market research of industry to identify potential contractors for the GENESIS logistics, engineering and facilities support contract.  The Request for Information (RFI) incl uded within this synopsis allows interested industry and other parties the opportunity to provide comments which will assist INSCOM in the development of the GENESIS contract.  The Government is neither negotiating nor calling for offers at this time.  Thi s announcement seeks an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay for any response preparation cost.  The government will not make an award on the basis of this sources sought synopsis.  Copies of information submitted by intere sted parties will be reproduced and submitted to the GENESIS Integrated Solutions Team (IST) for review and will be used to develop the acquisition strategy and draft Request for Proposal (RFP). 2.  Background. a.  The GENESIS program provides comprehensive engineering and logistics mission support for complex, unique, ground and air-based electronic intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) collection, production, dissemination, and communications sys tems classified at levels up to TS/SCI.  A draft Statement of Objective (SOO) is available on FedTeDS online at https://www.fedteds.gov/.  Performance locations are worldwide and include hostile areas.  The program includes, but is not limited to, support for ancillary and infrastructure systems and subsystems.  The ISR systems include Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), Human Intelligence (HUMINT), Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), an d Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) systems.  The GENESIS program ensures that electronic systems, security systems, Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) systems, and prototype intelligence hardware/software suites and facilities are developed, deployed, repaire d and maintained at the highest state of readiness consistent with commercial standards and/or Army directives.  The primary functional areas include Life Cycle Support (LCS) of intelligence systems and facilities (to include network administration as well  as hardware and software support); intelligence system engineering, integration, and fielding support; facility engineering and maintenance support to ISR facilities.  In addition, the contractor must provide comprehensive logistics and transportation/shi pping support to INSCOM missions worldwide and training for system operators and military unit level maintainers.  Required services are generally limited to a normal week day, but will include limited 24/7 support at designated locations and as required d uring QRC deployments, training, war game exercises, and mission surges.  Personnel performing this work must possess TS/SCI clearances and, in some positions, single scope polygraphs.  Contractor is expected to retain and operate a leased SCIF for GENESIS  utilization within the Fort Belvoir, VA commuting area.  The contract will be a base-year plus four one-year options.  The estimated contract value is $400 million for a five-year period.   	b.  The development, implementation, and sustainment of a contract vehicle such as GENESIS III is critical to maintaining INSCOM as a world class provider of intelligence to the Army and national level consumers. c.  The US Army Intelligence and Security Command, Fort Belvoir, VA plans to award a single, performance-based, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for this effo rt.  This contract is a follow-on contract.  The CACI Corporation is the incumbent contractor for GENESIS.  3.  Objectives. a.  INSCOM wishes to manage a single prime contractor responsible for maintenance for aviation-based Military Intelligence (MI) systems under the GENESIS contract.  The initial step in this process is the transition of the Airborne Reconnaissance Low (ARL)  Sensor logistics and maintenance requirements into the follow-on GENESIS III contract.  The ARL system is an airborne day/night reconnaissance and surveillance system that employs a suite of sensors to perform reconnaissance functions against a variety of  targets.  The systems are intended to detect, locate, and recognize threats likely to be encountered in support of foreign counter intelligence operations, low intensity conflict areas, and counter-insurgency operations.  The contractor will provide logis tics, maintenance and overall management support to include prime mission equipment (PME), associated ground mission equipment and training systems for all assigned ARL systems in worldwide locations in both long and short-term deployed locations in additi on to CONUS and OCONUS base locations.  These operations will require the contractor to work cooperatively with the airframe maintainer who is contracted by AMCOM and contractors for the Program Manager who install fleet upgrades. 4.  Information for interested parties.     a.  A Pre-solicitation Conference/Industry Day was conducted July 24, 2007.  Please check the web site https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/ for information regarding this event.     b.  Results of market research will provide information to determine if single award to small business will meet command objectives.     c.  NAICS codes is 541330 is applicable to this procurement. 5.  Market Survey / RFI Questions.  Potential offerors are requested to send their response to GenesisRecompete@mi.army.mil.  Responses are requested no later than close of business on October 8, 2007.  No phone or FAX requests will be accepted.

The work includes but is not limited to removing berms along Camp Creek; placement of rootwads and boulders for fish habitat; and relocation of existing vegetation to new stream channels.  The work sites are along an approximate 5 mile reach of Camp Creek.   Over 15 ponds will be worked on to restore the stream to its fully functioning biological potential.  Replacement of a culvert is required along with other stream restoration work. The estimated range of the work is between $250,000 and $500,000. A pre-solicitation site visit is scheduled for October 16 at 9:00 AM.  It is expected that this meeting will take ½ of the day.

<SUBJECT>J -- Inspection, Maintenance Services for Trane Chillers
<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION:  The 50th Contracting Squadron at Schriever AFB, Colorado intends to award on a sole-source basis, a fixed-price contract under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  This is a requirement for non-personal services for routine, annual and semi-annual maintenance of six centrifugal water chillers located at Schriever AFB.  These chillers, manufactured, maintained and repaired by the Trane Company, support 50th Space Wing operations.   Five of the chillers have a 950-ton cooling capacity and one of the chillers has a 500-ton cooling capacity. Three of the chillers use a 2-stage centrifugal cooling process, and three of the chillers use a 3-stage centrifugal cooling process.  All chillers utilize the purifier purge process.   The contractor must provide all personnel, tools, equipment, materials, transportation, supervision and other requirements necessary to perform the required inspections, maintenance, and repair of the chillers, and to perform any future upgrades of the software required to run these systems.  

This is a sole-source requirement.  Due to the specialized nature of these systems, all equipment maintenance, replacement and programming must be performed by the manufacturer.  The chiller cooling systems are under warranty, which requires that they be serviced by the manufacturer.  In addition, the manufacturer owns all rights to the technical publications, software and software upgrades.

Period of Performance: 1 Oct 2007 through 30 Sep 2012 (one base year plus four one-year options). The proposed contract is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one responsible source.  If a firm believes it is capable of meeting this requirement, it may identify its interest and capabilities within the response time set forth in this announcement.  A determination by the Government as to whether or not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. The North American Industry Classification System code is 333415 and the Size Standard is 750 employees.  
5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (10 AUG 2005)

When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 
(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, concerned parties may contact Ms. Diane Holmes, the MAJCOM Ombudsman, Headquarters Air Force Space Command AFSPC/A7KO, 150 Vandenburg Street, Suite 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4230.

The use of brand name description is esential to the Government's requireemtns, for Departmenet of State infrastructure connectivity requireemtns, tehreby precluding consideration fo teh products of anotehr company. Use of such software which has not been tested by teh Deparmtne nore been proven in field use may result in software compatibility conficts, increase teh complexity of integration, and may not be compatible with the Department of IT consolidation requirements. IRM has identified the software listed as a key component of teh Department's IT consolidation. Software listed above is required to provide teh automation and integration of Information Technology Infrastructure Libraray (ITIL) best practice processes for IT service management. The software listed is designed with hightly integrated modules to support each of teh ITIL Processes and Functions. THe integration provides a substantial increased capability for operational efficiency and significant decrease in maintenance erquirements due to common core functions and reuse of common code in related modultes. Department of State already own licenses for the Core Module and two Supporting Modules. BMC is te sole provider for modules that integrate into the existing BMC Remedy system that the Departmetn of State is currently using. Use of other software which has not been tested byt the department for compatibility with the existing BMC Remedy system will cuase unacceptable delays to the IT consolidation.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contratctors unique qualifications are cited as teh basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be teh only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key componenet of the Department's IT consolidation.  Additionaly, the use of a brand name description is essential to the Governement's requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.<BR><BR>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>Description
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), is seeking companies or organizations interested in entering into a research and product development partnership. The motivation for this partnership is to support the U.S. wind industry?s development of more reliable and higher performing wind turbines for the land-based bulk power market in all wind classes. Additionally, this effort will seek technology solutions that would improve wind turbine capacity factor and firm wind generated electricity DOE is also seeking proposals for partnerships to support the development of ocean energy technology and will provide laboratory-based testing and engineering assistance. This effort is subject to congressional appropriations in fiscal year 2008 for an Ocean Energy Program. Interested parties should respond to this Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) (2) announcement with a proposal by November 5th 2007. 

Background 
Reducing barriers to the expansion of wind and ocean energy is an important goal for the DOE Wind and Hydropower Technologies Program. One large wind turbine market barrier is rising costs driven by increasing commodities, exchange rates, and full production capacities. Technology improvements in reliability and performance are required to reduce the cost of, and thus the cost of energy from, wind energy systems. This effort hopes to expand on the Wind Program?s activities in these areas.

Modern ocean energy generators are still relatively immature technologies. Activities to further understand and develop these emerging energy technologies will allow for greater deployment and contribute to an improved scientific understanding.

Objective 
The objective of this CRADA solicitation is to make laboratory based resources available to companies or organizations interested in the further development of large wind turbine systems or components and investigation of ocean energy technologies. The CRADA targets research and development on components and systems that could be incorporated into commercially available land-based wind turbine architectures to improve industry market success in the near future and to accelerate deployment by increasing turbine capacity factors, firming wind generation and improving dispatchability. The program will not consider solicitations that focus development efforts on offshore or low wind speed technologies. In addressing ocean energy technologies the program hopes to support product improvement at a commercial or pre-commercial level. 

Partners selected for CRADAs will receive technical assistance and/or testing services from NREL/SNL. Although not defined specifically, possible areas of assistance include:
1) Testing of systems or components
2) Analysis of systems or structures
3) Development, modification, and/or use of analysis codes 
4) Data gathering on turbines or components
5) Aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, and other analysis
6) Design or technical system review
7) Other technical support

Up to six awardees will be selected during the first phase of this CRADA. DOE will contribute testing, laboratory support, or other technical assistance in the total amount of $1,000,000. The resources committed by the company or organization must be equal to or greater than the value of the assistance provided by DOE. If assistance over the DOE funded amount is required, it will be provided by the requesting party as payment for services provided to NREL or SNL. The duration of each CRADA project is expected to be less than two years from the time of the award.

NREL is the nation?s primary laboratory for renewable energy and energy efficiency research, development, and deployment and works closely with SNL. SNL?s primary renewable energy research has been focused on wind and PV technology development. Further information regarding the facilities and services provided by NREL?s National Wind Technology Center and SNL?s Wind Energy Technologies Program can be found at www.nrel.gov/wind/ and www.sandia.gov/wind/.

<SOLNBR>RAM-7-77580
<RESPDATE>110507
<ARCHDATE>11202007
<CONTACT>Neil Wikstrom, Senior Contract Administrator, Phone 303-384-6960, Fax 303-384-6901, Email neil_wikstrom@nrel.gov
<DESC>Description:
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), through its National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), is interested in forming partnerships with commercial utility-scale wind turbine industry developers, owners, operators, and manufacturers.  The purpose is to install and test commercial utility-scale wind turbines at the DOE National Wind Technology Center (NWTC)1.
It is anticipated that projects would be conducted over a 1-3 year period.  It is not currently planned that the wind turbines would remain at the wind site after testing is completed.  
Background:
Reducing barriers to the expansion of wind energy is an important goal for the DOE Wind and Hydropower Technologies Program. One large wind turbine market barrier is rising costs, driven by increasing commodities, exchange rates, and full production capacities. 
 
Technology improvements in reliability and performance are required to reduce the capital cost and cost of energy from wind energy systems. This effort hopes to expand on the Wind Programs activities in these areas.
The NWTC is an extreme-event test site, where turbines would be exposed to a wide spectrum of diverse and extreme conditions within a single wind season.  NWTC wind resource data can be found at http://www.nrel.gov/midc/nwtc_m2/.

Objective:
The DOE objective is to support industry?s efforts to improve reliability and performance of the utility-scale (500 kW or larger) commercial wind turbine fleet intended for deployment in the United States.  Testing activities could include:

?	Power performance
?	Acoustic noise
?	Structural loads
?	Power quality
 
The objectives of this testing are to:

?	Optimize turbine structures
?	Mitigate loads
?	Increase power production
?	Test safety system
?	Develop and validate controls
?	Improve system and component reliability

If other tests or objectives are needed, they may also be included.

Turbines could be used to support training of industry-partner staff and the next generation of wind technology engineers and technicians, and also serve as a showcase to educate the U.S. public on current commercial wind technology.
 
Laboratory support:
It is expected that the laboratory will provide infrastructure, testing, operations, and analysis support:

?	Foundation
?	Transportation
?	Installation services
?	Electrical connection
?	Communications
?	Meteorological tower
?	Data acquisition equipment
?	Instrumentation
?	Data collection support
?	Operations support
?	Data analysis support

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Data Security:
DOE, NREL, and SNL respect the importance of corporate intellectual property and data security while balancing the need to document the benefits of public expenditures. Provisions relating to proprietary information and intellectual property are set forth in the CRADA . 

Proposal Preparation:
The CRADA proposal must be submitted by 4:00 PM Mountain Time November 5th, 2007. CRADA proposals submitted thereafter may be considered if suitable CRADA collaborators are not selected from among the timely responses. Final negotiations of CRADA agreements, terms, and conditions will be completed after initial discussions have concluded.  The proposal and inquiries should be directed to:

?	The specific products or components being developed, refined, improved or validated.

CRADA proposals should also include the following information: the names, addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, and email addresses of the primary contact person. Single page r?sum??s of key project participants should be included but are not counted in the 15 page maximum proposal length.
Proposal Evaluation:
Selection of a CRADA offering will be at the discretion of NREL, SNL and DOE. The primary criteria used to evaluate submissions will be:
Technical Criteria:
?	Opportunities for the collaboration to benefit the US wind industry.
?	The ability of the vendor to provide equipment and support in a timely fashion.  Note that turbine ownership will remain with the supplier.
?	The benefit to the U.S. market of the systems and components being tested.

Programmatic Criteria:
?	Level of support requested from the laboratories.
?	Importance of technology development and testing results to general market acceptance.
?	Technical approach

Schedule:

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK

Background and Specifications for Germanium Planar 100 Pixel Detector

Background.  SSRL is a National synchrotron radiation user facility that provides state-of-the-art instrumentation on high-intensity beam lines for a large community of scientific users.  In the area of x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), SSRL operates six hard x-ray experimental stations fully or partially dedicated to this technique, and provides the needed end station equipment (cryostats, detectors, data acquisition hardware and software, etc.) for the performance of the scientific experiments.  XAS is a unique tool in that it can be used to determine accurate, atomic-level, structural information that is element specific for the samples under study.  The most demanding applications involve very dilute samples under naturally occurring conditions, in particular metalloproteins.  Due to the extremely low concentration of the elements of interest in the samples, the studies can only be performed by measuring the x-ray fluorescence produced by the sample.  The ability to make these measurements depends critically on using high-energy-resolution, high-throughput (count-rate) solid state detectors, as has well been demonstrated at SSRL and other synchrotron laboratories worldwide.

In order to reach the required sensitivity for the measurements, the detector needs to be able to resolve the fluorescence signal from the inherent background of elastic and inelastic scattering, as well as the fluorescence from other nuclei in the sample.  Hence excellent resolution is an absolute requirement (for most experiments 300-400 eV at high count-rates and low electronics shaping times).  This can only be achieved in any commercially supported robust technology by utilizing solid state detectors.  Solid state detectors are, however, inherently count-rate (throughput) limited.  Total count-rate limitations are overcome by integrating a number of small detector elements into arrays, with as high a number as technically feasible.  Since the fluorescence signal is isotropically distributed it is essential to collect as much as solid angle as possible, which again is made feasible by arraying many detector elements together in as closely packed arrangement as technically feasible.  

SSRL has since early on followed detector developments very closely and strived to obtain and provide the highest performance detectors available for XAS measurements at any given time.  We have implemented, in succession, 13-element and 30-element detectors, based on individual-element packing technology.  These detectors, which have all been manufactured by Canberra Industries, have performed excellently and to specification, proven robust and generally been continually in use 24 hrs/day, 7 days/week, 9 months/year.  These detectors are also in use at other synchrotron facilities in the USA (NSLS at BNL, APS at ANL) and abroad (ESRF, France; Photon Factory, Japan; CLS, Canada).  Some of the SSRL detectors are well beyond their expected ?life-time?, and all of them are challenged in performance by the new capabilities provided by the SPEAR3 accelerator upgrade.  With SPEAR3 soon expected to increase its current to 500 mA operations a significant enhancement in detectors is required.  

Current Request.  This statement of work thus describes a solid-state fluorescence x-ray detector that will be used for XAS measurements of ultra-dilute biological samples on SSRL?s beam line 9-3, which is a highest-performance world-class biological XAS beam line.  The approach and performance requirements for data collection necessitate the specifications described below, and funding has been provided for the procurement as part of the peer-reviewed SSRL Structural Molecular Biology program.

The requested detector addresses the count-rate and other performance issues through the division of the active detector area into a much larger number of smaller-sized elements (100), at the required high energy resolution per element, enabling very high total detector count-rates.  Furthermore, in order to achieve the required count-rates for the experimental setup, the detector needs to be positioned as close as possible to the sample, which requires a narrow front end, and therefore the highest possible close packing of the 100 elements.  This can only be achieved by the use of a monolithic detector array, i.e. an array of individual detectors fabricated close to one another on a single germanium crystal, as opposed to packing individual elements together.  (The choice of germanium as crystal material is dictated by combined elemental stopping power and energy resolution requirements.)  A monolithic detector eliminates the ?dead space? between individual detector elements in a conventional detector array.  It therefore provides the highest collection efficiency in area coverage, within the smallest possible area, meeting both detector performance and geometric requirements.

Requirements for the Detector System
The following specifications are required:
 
1. 	Solid state germanium detectors are required for the energy range to be covered (5-35 keV) in the XAS measurements.

2. 	A monolithic detector is required for the maximization of total count rate and for a minimum front end size, to enable close proximity to the sample and intersection of the maximum number of x-ray photons.

3. 	The array shall have 5x5 mm sized pixel elements, close packed into a 10x10 square element array for a total of 100 elements, with 99% of the total area to be active with no dead zone.

4. 	The detector front-end needs to be enclosed in a circular enclosure, with diameter and length requirements as specified on the attached drawing.

5. 	The detector front end shall have a Be entrance window of highest-purity, 125 micrometer thickness, with a 70-mm diameter size.  

6. 	The energy resolution performance for the pixels, measured using XIA electronics (see below) should be:
Typical performance at 6 keV:
At 1 ?s shaping time: 165 eV
At 0.5 ?s shaping time: 200 eV
At 0.25 ?s shaping time: 250 eV
At 0.125 ?s shaping time: 300 eV

Guaranteed performance at 6 keV of:
At 8-12 ?s shaping time, 1000 cps: FWHM <145 eV
At 0.5 ?s shaping time, 100 Kcps: FWHM <235 eV
At 0.125 ?s shaping time, 100 Kcps: FWHM <400 eV

Average performance at 6 keV of:
At 0.5 ?s shaping time: 230 eV
At 0.125 ?s shaping time: 350 eV

7.  	More than 95 pixels to be active
     	More than 90 pixels to meet the resolution specifications

8. 	The detector shall be cooled by an integral liquid nitrogen cryostat with a dewar capacity of 30 liters.

9. 	The liquid nitrogen dewar shall be vertically attached to the detector.

10. 	The detector system shall be supplied with 100 pre-amplifiers of performance/design to match the specifications above, and to be compatible with and provide required performance with X-ray Instrumentation Associates (XIA) Digital X-ray Processors (DXPs), model DXP-xMAP. 

11. 	A high-voltage power supply and pre-amplifier power supply that meet the requirements of the detector shall be provided.

12. 	A LN2 monitor and control system for high-voltage cutoff shall be included.

13. 	Complete standard cable set to be included.  Final cable length requirements to be decided latest by 1 month before delivery after communication between vendor and end-user.

14. 	The detector system shall be provided with mounting points on the underside of the dewar and front-end and a base support.

15. 	Initial performance tests to be performed at the factory with XIA electronics.  Final performance tests to be performed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory using XIA electronics.

16.  	The vendor shall have extensive experience with the manufacturing of monolithic germanium detectors, of a high number of detector elements, for synchrotron radiation-based XAS measurements, and a strong demonstrated ability to provide support (service, maintenance, repair/refurbishment as per operational needs) for the detectors that they manufacture.

17.  	Final drawings of system shall be provided to SSRL and approved prior to assembly.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to:

1) Extend  response date to 25 September 2007, 4pm Mountain Standard Time

2) Questions & Answers
Q1- Dual Rear Stabilizing Jacks: The system we offer to meet power and ECU requirements does not come with rear stabilizing jacks, is this a rigid requirement?  The system components and configuration has been evaluated by DoD at Aberdeen proving grounds.
A1- 1. This requirement is largely the result of previous trailers utilizing standard tires (they deform too much to provide a stable base).  If the solution offered up utilizes run flat tires (like in a HMMWV) and meets DoD standards, the jacks aren't required.

Q2- Spare Tire with Mount Assembly:  Our trailers use HMMWV run-flat tires, no spares are provided, is this essential?
A2- Similar to Q1, above: Our previous solutions did not use the run flat tires, so a spare was critical.  In this case, a spare is highly desired by the customer, but not essential.

Q3- Request clarification on two salient characteristics:  12.5 - 20 KW Mounted Quiet Diesel Generator with Removable Protective Cage (Must Operate With or Without Cage in Place) & Mounted Marine Fuel Cell with Minimum 19 Gallon Capacity with Removable Protective Cage (Must Operate With or Without Cage in Place).
Generator and ECU are enclosed to protect the systems from debris and provide tactically quiet operation, the cage in or out could be done but I would like to understand why this requirement is needed, it seems the equipment could be damaged or the operator could be placed in an unsafe environment.
A3- If the solution offered has the generator, ECU and tank fully enclosed, the cages are not required.  The trailers we have used before did not have fully enclosed systems, so the cages were essential for protection when we went OTR or up on the range.  We would pull the cages for maintenance, etc.  Usually, solutions with this gear fully enclosed have built-in access panels, etc., so a cage would not need to be removed for PMIs, etc.

Q4- Please provide item description or define the function of: Mounted Marine Fuel Cell with Minimum 19 Gallon Capacity with Removable Protective Cage (Must Operate With or Without Cage in Place)
A4- The fuel cell is just the diesel tankage for the generator.  We have used marine cells in the past because they hold up to the elements better, but our gens were not mil spec - a mil spec unit would likely have a fully enclosed gen and fuel cell...which pretty much gives you the same benefits.  The cage piece  discussed previously: it is just there to protect the fuel cell from debris (falling rocks, tools...and people) during transport and ops.  We remove it for PMIs, etc.

3) Revised Salient Characteristics
SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:
- 20 Foot Trailer
- 2-5/16 Inch Adjustable Ball Hitch with Conversion Kit for DOD standard pintle hook assembly
- Dual Rear Stabilizing Jacks; Not Required if Solution utilizes Run Flat Tires that meet DoD standards
- Minimum 12 Inch Ground Clearance
- Spare Tire with Mount Assembly; Not Required if Solution Utilizes Run Flat Tires
- MOB42 ECU with Canvas or Similar Dust Cover (ECU with Minimum 96,000 BTU Cooling Capacity & 33,000 BTU Heating Capacity, Minimum Dual Supply Ducts, Single Return Duct, On-Board Thermostat with Emergency Cut-Off.
- 12.5 - 20 KW Mounted Quiet Diesel Generator with Removable Protective Cage (Must Operate With or Without Cage in Place); Cage is not required if ECU and Tankage is fully enclosed with   
- Mounted Marine Fuel Cell with Minimum 19 Gallon Capacity with Removable Protective Cage (Must Operate With or Without Cage in Place); Cage is not required if ECU and Tankage is fully enclosed
- Cargo Area must have Lash Points and Topless Cage with Pull-Off Rear Access Gates for Storage Area

52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items. (Jan 1999)
(a) The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this Request for Quotation (RFQ) to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:

(i)	Technical Capability
(ii)	Price

Technical is more important than price.
TECHNICAL CAPABILITY
The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct comparative evaluations of quotes in accordance with FAR 13.106-2(b)(3).  Technical capabilities which may be considered include but are not limited to objective considerations such as speed as well as subjective criteria such as ease of use.  The evaluation of subjective criteria such as ?ease of use? is solely within the government?s discretion. 
The government reserves the right to require a technical demonstration of CLIN   0001 on Thursday the 27th of Sept at 2:00 p.m. EST.  The government shall notify the contractor if such demonstration is required by Wednesday 26 Sept 2007 3:00 p.m.   If the contractor refuses or is otherwise unable to comply with this requirement, their offer shall be deemed unacceptable.
 
If the government is already familiar with a contractor's product, the government reserves the right to exempt that product from the requirement for technical demonstration.
 


	PRICE
	Quotes will be evaluated for price reasonableness in accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a).  This may be based upon:
(1)	Competitive quotations 
(2)	Market research;
(3)	Comparison of the proposed price with prices found reasonable on previous purchases;
(4)	Current price lists, catalogs, or advertisements. However, inclusion of a price in a price list, catalog, or advertisement does not, in and of itself, establish fairness and reasonableness of the price;
(5)	A comparison with similar items in a related industry;
(6)	The contracting officer?s personal knowledge of the item being purchased;
(7)	Comparison to an independent Government estimate; or
(8)	Any other reasonable basis.
(b)  A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding purchase order without further action by either party. Before the quote?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of Provision)

Clauses may be accessed in full text at these addresses:   www.acqnet.gov/far and http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dfars/index.html.   It is the responsibility of the contractor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.
