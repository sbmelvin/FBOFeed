<p>(X) Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.<br />(X) This proposed procurement includes a family group of items within the Federal Supply Class: 25<br />(X) Reverse Auction(RA) will be used:<br />"The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307."</p>

NSN/NIIN: See attachment for listing of all items

The intention of this synopsis is to add additional line item components in support of foreign military sales for  Australia to an established 5YR Repair Basic Ordering Agreement with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (78286), N0038316G002F. 

NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) will be modifying the existing BOA which provides for the furnishing of labor, material, reports and parts as may be required to restore H60 and H53 components to add an additional 104 NIINs for the Royal Australian Navy H60 platform to serviceable operating conditions. The proposed contract modification has a total estimated dollar value of $59.6 million dollars.
 The BOA was established on 03 JUN 2016 and is for a period of five (5) years. Please see attached documentation for exact listing of NIINs. 

Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (78286) located in Stratford, CT and is Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and the only known source to possess full repair capability. Orders issued under the Basic Ordering Agreement and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.
 Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companyâ€™s experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 

https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer.
 Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

Responses to this notice of intent shall be submitted no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this synopsis to NAVSUP WSS Philadelphia, Attn: Mrs. Christina Vidal, Contract Specialist, Code (N732.46), 700 Robbins Ave, Bldg 1, Philadelphia, PA 19111.

The estimated construction cost is expected to range from $15,000,000.00 to $20,000,000.00.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The Air Force Civil Engineering Center (AFCEC), on behalf of HAFB, proposes to construct a new Systems Engineering Management Facility to replace an aging structure built in 1953-1955. The new facility will be located on base adjacent to existing building 1604 which was constructed as the first phase of this two phase project. Building 1604, which is complete, created a new 2-story 30,000 square foot office building. The second phase and focus of this notice, will add an additional 40,000 square feet adjacent to building 1604. Additionally, as part of the SMEF project, existing building 1600 will be demolished after the current occupants are moved to the new SMEF building.</p>
<p>The SMEF design and construction will utilize economical design and construction methods compatible with applicable DoD, Air Force, and base design standards. The project will include design and construction of the SMEF building, which is primarily office space, new access road, landscaping, site improvements, and necessary utilities and communication systems. The facility will be designed as permanent construction in accordance with DoD Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 1-200-01, General Building Requirements and UFC 1-200-02, High Performance and Sustainable Building Requirements and the facility will be LEED Silver certified.

<DESC>Subject: Request for Information (RFI)<br />Lighter Weight Materials for a Tropical Uniform - Commercially Available
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY for printed fabric materials that may be suitable for use in a tropical wet environment and are capable of meeting the basic requirements described below. This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB). It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources for planning purposes only. Responses to this notice are not considered as offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information presented or the use of any such information.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is requesting information on commercially-available fabrics that may be used in a Jungle Combat Clothing Ensemble. These materials may have potential use as base fabrics, design features and/or reinforcement patches. A separate RFI will be posted for novel material development.</p>
<p>The objective of this RFI is to determine the availability in the commercial marketplace of materials that may be suitable for use in a tropical wet environment, where temperatures range from 75 to 95&deg;F and relative humidity ranges from 75% to 100%. Further considerations are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Soldier priorities for a uniform are quick-drying followed by, durable, breathable and lighter weight. <br />&bull; Materials of interest are commercially available woven, knit, mesh, spacer, auxetic and phase-change materials that meet Soldier priorities. Materials must be machine washable. <br />&bull; Attributes such as no melt/no-drip materials and vector protection (via permethrin treatment or other modes of action) are required. Fabrics should contain an EPA-approved treatment (e.g. Permethrin, etc.) that is in accordance with EPA-approved levels to protect against vector-borne diseases.<br />&bull; Desired material durability and other performance attributes are listed in Table 1.<br />&bull; Fabrics should have the ability to be camouflage printed via rotary screen printing or dyed, depending on the intended application.<br />&bull; According to Soldiers, the 50/50 Nylon/Cotton rip stop uniform (~6.5 osy) takes more than 4 hours to dry in a tropical wet environment. A more acceptable range in a hot, humid environment (i.e., 75-95&deg;F and 70-100% RH) is 1-2 hours.</p>
<p>REQUESTED INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Vendors who believe they have materials capable of meeting the above requirements are requested to submit a short (no more than 5 pages total per sample) summary, including Company name and address, point of contact with phone number, DUNS number, CAGE Code and a statement regarding any small business designation (if applicable), by the date and to the address noted below. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 313310 and the small business size is 1,000 employees. Responses should include</p>
<p>1. A description of the tropical combat materials being submitted and a summary of the technical approaches taken to meet the performance requirements of this RFI.<br />2. Estimated cost per linear yard.<br />3. Test data demonstrating the performance of the material being submitted as it compares to the technical requirements of this RFI in Table 1 (attached).<br />4. Samples equivalent to a minimum of one (1) linear yard of material (in any color) with written assurance that the shade, color fastness and spectral reflectance requirements can be met if printed in a multi-color earth tone camouflage pattern. Submitted materials must be permethrin or etofenprox treated by an EPA-registered facility.<br />5. A material description including fiber blend percentages and Berry compliance documentation (all textile-based technology products-all materials and manufacturing-must comply with Berry Amendment Restrictions, per DFARS 252.225-7012).</p>
<p>Respondents may submit up to five (5) different fabric candidates, but should clearly identify the advantages/disadvantages of each. Any finishes added to the fabric should be identified in the response. Respondents should clearly identify any areas where the samples do not meet the attribute thresholds in Table 1 and discuss tradeoffs.</p>
<p>The submissions may be used by the Government in formulating a program to assess the performance of the submitted materials and design concepts for functionality in a tropical environment. While there is no guarantee that a subsequent solicitation will be issued and/or a contract awarded, currently, it is the Government's interest to explore the feasibility of procuring lighter weight textile materials for use in tropical uniforms.</p>
<p>Respondents are requested to provide information and sample materials by Wednesday, 14 December 2016/3:00PM Eastern Standard Time.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are to be sent to Ms. Melynda Perry, NSRDEC, ATTN: RDNS-SEW-TDT, 15 General Greene Ave., Natick, MA 01760-5019. This notice is for information and sample materials only. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No solicitation document exists. POC for this request is Ms. Melynda Perry. Email your questions to the POC at the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center at the following address: melynda.perry.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</p>
<p>This RFI is solely for information purposes and does not constitute a solicitation or the issuance thereof. This notice does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation and/or award a contract. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly. Any information or sample materials submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the Government for such information or sample materials. Any testing results will be controlled and used for Government purposes only. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate.

<p>Classification data: Classification data for corporations, businesses and funds such as legal entity identifiers and proprietary classification data.</p>

<p>5. Their CAGE Code;</p>

<DESC><br />MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is conducting market research to support the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) requirement for Computational Biochemistry and Molecular Modeling Support.</p>
<p>The FDA is seeking small business sources to determine the availability and capability of small businesses capable of providing the required services described herein. Other than small business concerns are also encouraged to submit capability statements. The following information is provided to assist the FDA in conducting Market Research to identify potential contractors for this effort:</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is-541711- Research and Development in Biotechnology; Small Business Size Standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>The FDA/NCTR, has a need for Computational Biochemistry and Molecular Modeling Support to support the FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMi)-supported project E7391. The Contractor shall provide computational structural biochemistry and molecular modeling to predict relative thermal stabilities for the Staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA), Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), Staphylococcal enterotoxin G (SEG), Staphylococcal enterotoxin H (SEH), and Staphylococcal enterotoxin I (SEI) proteins using 3-dimensional structures for SEA, SEB, SEG, and SEH available to the public on-line via the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data Bank (PDB) website (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do) or equivalent mirror sites.</p>
<p>The services to be provided are essential for completion of goals associated with NCTR experiment E7391 entitled, "Thermal inactivation of Staphylococcal enterotoxins in milk."</p>
<p>Performance requirements</p>
<p>1. Predict relative thermal stabilities at pH 6.7 for the SEA/SEB and SEB/SEG pairs using molecular modeling and methods that are equivalent to the one implemented in the FOLD-X software suite and molecular dynamics simulations in GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations software). Deliverable: full report on molecular dynamic simulations and estimate of relative thermal stabilities expressed in kcal/mol.</p>
<p>2. The Contractor shall model the structures of a series of selected n=10 single variants of SEA, SEB, and SEG and assess their relative stabilities. The Contractor shall use statistical modeling to predict relative thermal stabilities of all possible variants by combining these single point mutations, i.e. 210 = 1024 variants. Deliverable: estimates of relative thermal stabilities of variants expressed in kilocalories per mole.</p>
<p>3. The SEH isoform will be modeled based on structural homology with SEA. Molecular simulations will be used to estimate relative thermal stabilities of the SEA/SEH pair using standard methods described above. The impact of single point mutations on the modeled SEH isoform will be calculated. The Contractor shall then model a series of n=10 selected single amino acid substitutions for SEH, assess their relative stabilities, and apply statistical modeling to predict relative thermal stabilities of all 1024 variants for these mutants. Deliverable: full report on molecular dynamic simulations and estimate of relative thermal stabilities expressed in kilocalories per mole.</p>
<p>4. The SEI isoform has no close structural homologues available. Ab initio structural modeling will be performed using a library of structural fragments of 5 residues. The models will then be subjected to thorough molecular simulations to ensure the 3D structure models are correct. Relative thermal stabilities of SEA and SEI will be derived using GROMACS. Standard methods equivalent to the one implemented in FOLD-X algorithm will be used to estimate relative thermal stabilities. Deliverable: full report on molecular dynamic simulations and estimate of relative thermal stabilities expressed in kilocalories per mole.</p>
<p><br />FOB Point Destination. All items/deliverables shall include shipping, handling and in-side delivery to the destination identified herein. FOB Point of Delivery for Services and Supplies will be the FDA located at 3900 NCTR Road, Jefferson, AR 72079.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: All deliverables shall be completed and submitted to the Government within 180 calendar days after award.</p>
<p>Full funding for this project and for this contract has been obtained through the FDA MCMi Challenge Grant Program. FDA MCMi approval for this project included approval for Peaccel as the provider for the computational biochemistry and molecular modeling services that are an integral and major component of the overall project. The FDA has determined that Peaccel has a successful record for providing computation biochemistry and molecular modeling support for the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry. Peaccel investigators have established a strong record of scientific publications in the area of computation biochemistry and molecular modeling, demonstrating a history of successful collaborations with academic and nonprofit organizations. Other interested vendors may respond however for these reasons the federal government may decide to limit competition for this contract to Peaccel as a sole source procurement.</p>
<p>The offeror shall furnish sufficient technical information necessary for the Government to conclusively determine that the offered products/services and components meet the technical requirements identified above. Though the target audience is small business manufacturers or small businesses capable of supplying a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer all interested parties may respond. At a minimum, responses shall include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Business name, DUNS number, business address, business website, business size status (i.e., SB, VOSB, SDVOSB, HUBZone SB, SDB, WOSB, LB), point of contact name, mailing address (if different from business address), phone number and email address (Provide this same information if responding to provide a product manufactured by another firm);<br />&bull; Sufficient descriptive literature that unequivocally demonstrates that offered products and services can meet the above requirements. All descriptive material necessary for the government to determine whether the service/product offered meets the technical requirements including: technical specifications, descriptive material, literature, brochures and other information, which demonstrates the capabilities of the contractor to meet the requirement.<br />&bull; Provide recent (within the last 3 years) and relevant prior experience information for which the offeror has provided same or substantially similar Computational Biochemistry and Molecular Modeling Support services as set forth herein. Offeror should detail similar scope, complexity and magnitude. For each reference include period of performance, description (how is this relevant to current requirement), dollar value, your role and responsibilities as either a prime or subcontractor , client name, client address, client point of contact name, client point of contact phone number, and client point of contact email address. Respondents who do not provide a valid email address for the POC may be evaluated negatively.<br />&bull; Scientific publications in the area of computation biochemistry and molecular modeling, demonstrating a history of successful collaborations with academic and nonprofit organizations<br />&bull; If applicable, identification of the firm's GSA Schedule contract(s) by Schedule number and SINs that are applicable to this potential requirement. Detailed list of items included and not included on the GSA contract to meet this requirement.<br />&bull; Provide information if any of these specifications are too restrictive. No response will be considered that the listed specifications are adequate in a competitive environment. <br />&bull; If a large business, identify the subcontracting opportunities that would exist for small business concerns; <br />&bull; Standard commercial warranty and payment terms; and <br />&bull; Though this is not a request for quote, informational pricing is encouraged.</p>
<p>The government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, not identified in the response.</p>
<p>The Government encourages any comments and/or suggestions from any interested party, regarding the specifications. While the Government will not respond directly to your comments and/or suggestions; we will consider them as we finalize the specifications in preparation for the forthcoming solicitation. <br /><br />Interested Parties shall respond with capability statements which are due in person, by postal mail or email to the point of contact listed below on or before November 14, 2016 by 13:00 hours (Central Time in Jefferson, Arkansas) to nick.sartain@fda.hhs.gov, or mail to the Food and Drug Administration, OO/OFBA/OAGS/DAP, Attn: Nick Sartain, 3900 NCTR Road, Building 50, Room 422, Jefferson, AR 72079-9502. Reference FDA1176299.</p>
<p>Notice of Intent<br />Responses to this sources sought announcement will assist the Government in determining whether or not any future requirement similar to this one should be set aside for small business, made available to full and open competition or procure through sole-source acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes<br />This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Quality Positioning Services (QPS) for six Qimera Software Licenses which includes the first year of maintenance for the Office of Ocean and Exploration Research (OER) in Silver Spring, MD. The period of performance is for a one year beginning on or about December 1, 2016.
<p><br />Justification for Sole Source<br />The NOAA OER mapping team currently uses QPS Fledermaus software products that are essential for data processing workflow. QPS Fledermaus is used for 4D data visualization, quality control, geospatial product exports, and ROV dive planning. Fledermaus Mid-Water and Fledermaus Geocoder Toolbox are exclusively relied on for analyzing mid-water sonar data and seafloor sonar backscatter data, respectively. Using QPS Qimera for initial sonar data cleaning, quality control, and bathymetric terrain surface generation would enable a faster, more efficient workflow and better integration with existing software and related file formats. No other sonar data cleaning/gridding product offers these benefits.</p>
<p>Qimera is an easy to use yet powerful sonar data processing application. Built using core QPS technologies, As well as QPS QINSy projects, Qimera supports the major raw sonar file formats and by working with the Dynamic Workflow<sup>TM</sup> it revolutionizes the way data is handled and the operator experience when processing hydrographic data. Qimera intelligently and interactively guides the operator through the data processing stages, simplifying what traditionally has been a convoluted process. Utilizing the latest computing technologies, the unique IO Balanced Multi-Core engine in Qimera is specifically designed to process sonar data as rapidly as possible. Qimera also contains a number of advanced tools including Sound Velocity Profiling (refraction), Calibration (Patch Test), and a Wobble Test (for troubleshooting common sensor installation/integration issues). In addition, Qimera has advanced customizable data filtering tools that greatly increase the speed and efficiency by which multibeam sonar surfaces can be cleaned of rejected soundings and data artifacts. These filter tools are proprietary to Qimera and are needed by the program to increase the efficiency of data cleaning work and save personnel time dedicated to this essential portion of our processing workflow.</p>
<p>Qimera supervises a less experienced user through the stages of bathymetry processing by intelligently prompting the next necessary action(s). The Dynamic Workflow<sup>TM</sup> uniquely remembers what actions and settings have been applied to the project data, and so is able to highlight files that need further processing actions in order to complete the workflow. The Okeanos Explorer utilizes "Explorer-in-Training" intern students with often no experience with seafloor mapping, so streamlined data processing software workflows are extremely important.</p>
<p>QPS is the sole seller of the software and licenses, maintenance, and support and thus there is no other source available.</p>
<p>Sources Sought<br />This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive offers and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the licenses and maintenance may submit substantiating documentation in writing within ten days of this notice. Responses can be sent via e-mail to shelley.smith@noaa.gov. Documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REQUEST FOR INFORMATION</span></strong>
<p>Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) is seeking information from industry to assist with the small business planning for new requirements.<br /><br /><strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES (RFQ). NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</strong></p>
<p>1. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), Inquiry, Quote, Order (IQO) section is conducting this Request for Information (RFI) as market research to determine whether there is sufficient telecomm companies capable of delivering this requirement in support of the Warfighter. The results of this RFI will be used to determine if future IQO requirements be set-aside for small business, or if the IQO process should allow for unrestricted competition.</p>
<p>2. FAR Clause 52.219-14, titled, "Limitations on Subcontracting," requires by submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the contractor agrees that in performance of the contract for services (except construction): "At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern." In the mid-1990s, the Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) ruled that since most of the labor for these types of requirements was provided by long haul or Local Exchange Carriers (LECs) which are large businesses, they were "ostensible" subcontractors to the small business awardees and in violation of 52.219-14.</p>
<p>3. This Request for Information is soliciting responses to the following questions from all small and large business concerns which fall under the following North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Codes: <br />517110: Wired Telecommunications Carriers and 517911: Telecommunication Resellers.</p>

Please utilize the below link for the process of obtaining a BA:<br />https://depsland.csd.disa.mil/html/vendor/vendorreference.html<br /><br />B. For new telecommunications companies not doing business with DISA currently. Are you providing any of these services in the commercial sector? If so, please list the services being provided.</p>
<p>C. Were any CSAs awarded to your company by DITCO in the last year?</p>
<p>D. What types of labor do personnel in your company perform when awarded requirements for Telecommunications?</p>
<p>E. Does your company perform at least 50% of the labor costs on all awarded requirements, per FAR 52.219-14?</p>
<p>Yes______ No______</p>
<p>F. Does your company have a point of presence at said location? If not, what is your nearest point of presence or central office that can support a 1 GIG connection?</p>
<p>Yes______ No______ Location____________</p>

<DESC>SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is operated by Stanford University for the Department of Energy. As a management and operating contractor, subcontracts awarded by the Laboratory are not Federal procurements, and are not directly subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations in 48 CFR. Nonetheless, certain Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations may affect our DOE approved purchasing system, as required by statute, regulation, or contract terms and conditions.
<p>&nbsp;The purpose of this listing is to identify potential sources capable of design and fabrication of portable clean zones for the field installation of equipment in clean environments. Clean zones must be custom designed to meet the space constraints of the projects and meet the ISO Class 4 specification (ISO 14644-1). Prior to fabrication, three dimensional flow modeling shall demonstrate acceptable performance when integrated with the equipment. Verification testing of fabricated unit using airborne particle counters (ASTM F50) and witness samples with optical particle counts (ASTM E2088) will be required.</p>

<p>Project Description: This is a market survey for providing Arkansas native warm-season prairie grass seed for re-establishment of the Grand Prairie. See General Information and Specific Tasks below:</p>
<p>General Information<br />1. GENERAL: This is a non-personnel services contract to provide native Arkansas-genotype prairie grass seed and hay for re-establishment of the Grand Prairie in Arkansas. The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the services herein.<br />1.1 Description of Services/Introduction: The work required by this contract requires the contractor to provide native Arkansas-genotype Big Bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), Little Bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans) seed (hereafter referred to as &lsquo;seed') and hay bale delivery resulting from the management of production areas of that seed, as well as planting of seed on specified areas planned for prairie restoration.<br />1.2. Background: The Grand Prairie Area Demonstration Project (GPADP) and the Bayou Meto Basin Project (BMB) Projects are within a region that historically contained 400,000 acres of tall-grass prairie. To help recreate the native prairie ecosystem, restoration of native prairie grass habitat will be a major environmental feature of both projects. Prairie restoration efforts will focus on the establishment of the four grasses that historically dominated the Grand Prairie region: Big Bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), Little Bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans). Seeds from Grand Prairie regional specific populations of prairie grasses shall be used for planting to restore genotypes that evolved specifically within the Grand Prairie region as a result of many years of geographic isolation.<br />1.3. Objectives: Contractor is required to provide seed, hay bale delivery, as well as planting and monitoring services for the GPADP and BMB Projects, based upon acreages determined by USACE approximately one year in advance. Planting is not expected to exceed 100 acres in any given year.<br />1.4. Scope:<br />&bull; The contractor shall provide clean, mixed seed of the specified species at a ratio of 2 pounds each of BBS, LBS, and IG to 1 pound of SWG per acre of planting required. <br />&bull; Native prairie grass planting shall occur on an &lsquo;as needed' basis in areas specified one year in advance.<br />1.5. Quality Control: <br />The contractor shall develop and maintain an effective quality control program to ensure services are performed in accordance with this PWS. The contractor shall develop and implement procedures to identify defective services, and prevent and ensure non-recurrence of defective services. The contractor's quality control program (QCP) is the means by which the contractor is assured that their work complies with the requirements of the contract. Contractor shall provide a QCP to the Contracting Officers Representative (COR), in writing, within 30 days of contract award. After acceptance of the quality control plan the contractor shall receive the contracting officer's acceptance in writing of any proposed change to the contractors QC system.<br />Contractor shall have representative samples of seeds tested for percentage live seed, percentage of weeds, and percentage of other crops. Testing to ensure that no noxious weeds are present in any seed is also required annually. Seed analysis will be conducted in accordance with Association of Official Seed Analysts, Inc. (AOSA) protocols. A minimum of three samples of each species will be analyzed, and results will be provided to the Government.

<ARCHDATE>12302016
<CONTACT>Regina R. Farrell, Phone 8138267170, Email regina.farrell@socom.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES (SOF)<br />SECURITY LABELING AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT SOLUTION
<p>A. Introduction</p>
<p>U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is investigating the use of commercial solutions for marking, labeling, and controlling access to sensitive information. The solution must be able to make real-time decisions for restricting or permitting an individual to access, change, delete, receive, or forward information based on the classification level of the information when compared to their clearance level and compartment access including the attributes of the facility, network, and receiving individual.</p>
<p>Based on the responses and feedback received from this request for information (RFI), program representatives may choose to meet with potential offerors and hold one-on-one discussions or demonstrations. Such discussions would only be intended to obtain further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements, including any development and certification risks.</p>
<p>This RFI is being issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quotation (RFQ), or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice. In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes, the Government will not pay for any information/items submitted in response to the RFI. No determination as to the viability of this requirement has been made at this point, and there is currently no solicitation for this effort. Any solicitation resulting from this RFI may be announced separately.</p>
<p>B. Background</p>
<p>To securely create, access, process, manipulate, and monitor information, USSOCOM has the need to implement discretionary access controls (DAC) on top of the currently established mandatory access controls (MAC). This RFI is seeking solutions that "understand" the contents of the information and classifies it according to various programs' security classification guides (SCG), and then labels the information according to Security Markings Program document marking requirements. Further the solution must restrict or grant an individual's access to information based on, minimally, four attributes: the information (classification, control markings, caveats), individual (clearance level and compartment read-ons), facility, and network accreditation.</p>
<p>The solution will work within a given organization's Active Directory (AD) domain as well as across multiple organizations' AD domains. In a multiple organization environment, USSOCOM must still be able to account for the integrity of the information and the extent of its distribution.</p>
<p>The solution should be developed against open standards but also be consistent with standards developed by the Department of Defense, National Security Agency, and National Institute of Standards and Technology for the protection and dissemination of information.</p>
<p>C. Request for Information</p>
<p>For purposes of this RFI, USSOCOM would like a commercial or government off-the-shelf solution. The capability should be device agnostic, will be able to deliver capabilities to authorized users in disconnected and tactical environments, and will require minimal additional development.</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<p>&bull; The program office is seeking information on a TRL6 or greater solution that, with minimal additional development, can provide USSOCOM a viable capability. <br />&bull; The solution must integrate into a Microsoft-based environment.<br />&bull; The design approach will enable efficient and secure integration supporting operations on multiple networks.<br />&bull; The capabilities may potentially be demonstrated in a laboratory environment.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements</p>
<p>&bull; Support up to 10,000 concurrent users before needing to scale to another increment of capacity.<br />&bull; Operate on MS Server 2012 R2, SQL 2012, NetApp Storage, MS Office 2010, MS Exchange 2010, and Skype for Business.<br />&bull; Control access to information based on information, user, facility, and network classification labels/level, handling caveats, and control markings.<br />&bull; Based on a program's SCG, automatically suggest Security Markings Program compliant content classification labels, handling caveats, and control markings. <br />&bull; Provide users a tool to properly mark information following Security Markings Program requirements. <br />&bull; Establish trusted connections with other organizations to allow the sharing of classified information across organizational boundaries.<br />&bull; Monitor and log:<br />o Who is accessing the information.<br />o From where the information is being accessed.<br />o From what system the information is being accessed.<br />o Changes made to the information.<br />o Changes made to the markings or labels.<br />&bull; Automatically control distribution (allow, block, delete, redact) of information to individuals, facilities, or networks.<br />&bull; Be highly scalable with easy synchronization of new information and/or additional users.<br />&bull; Role-based system (administrator, privileged user, etc.).<br />&bull; Be at TRL6 or greater.<br />&bull; Present an intuitive User Interface with modern design standards.<br />&bull; Designed with an open architecture to ensure future enhancements.</p>
<p><br />If your organization has the potential capability and capacity to meet the requirements, please providing the following:</p>
<p>Architecture Information<br />1. The high level approach providing the capability.<br />2. A summary of the architectural environment of each possible alternative as well as drawings or system overviews.<br />3. Required back-end physical and virtual servers to support 10000 concurrent users.</p>
<p>Capability Delivery<br />4. A description of how the capability will be delivered to the Government.<br />5. A description of the infrastructure and software used to build the capability and the timelines required for implementation.<br />6. A description of usage metrics and monitoring capabilities, such as a dashboard, that would be available to the user.</p>
<p>Access and Security information<br />7. Please describe the security posture and how you control access to the capability.</p>
<p>Contract/Pricing information<br />8. Provide your proposed business model in order to maintain your solution.<br />9. Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for planning purposes only. The ROM shall include an estimated price for a one-year of capability/service. If the price is based on data volume and/or usage, please provide a pricing model. <br />10. Please detail any proposed catalog pricing for licenses, subscriptions, storage, usage, processing, etc.</p>
<p><br />D. Instructions for Responding</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI are due no later than 1200 PM ET on 17 November 2016. Submit questions via email to the point of contact below.</p>
<p>&#61607; Responses shall be submitted in two separate documents: (1) Technical Information and (2) Contract/Pricing Information. Responses shall be limited to ten pages total, not including diagrams. The Technical Information document shall be limited to a maximum of eight pages, not including diagrams, and the Contract/Pricing Information document shall be limited to two pages. Responses shall provide sufficient detail on new capabilities delivered and pricing ROM to enable the Government to formulate an abbreviated business case analysis and proposed CLIN structure in support of a potential future draft Request for Proposal.<br />&#61607; USSOCOM's intent is to arrive at a clear understanding of your technical and value-based solution through a succinct submission. <br />&#61607; Address all questions and requirements including ROM, schedule, and risks. <br />&#61607; Feel free to provide other recommendations or suggestions on related issues not specifically addressed above, but within the page limits set forth above.<br />&#61607; The electronic copy of your responses must be in an Adobe PDF or Microsoft Word (Adobe PDF or MS Visio for diagrams). Again, please separate Technical Information and Contract/Pricing Information into two separate documents. <br />&#61607; The first page of the submission must state the RFI title, the company's name, and individual POC, to include e-mail address and telephone number that can be contacted for clarification or questions regarding this submission.<br />&#61607; Any proprietary data that is included in the response must be marked appropriately at the paragraph level (page level is acceptable for full page table, graphs, etc.). Any response marked proprietary at the document level will not be considered.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE - THIS IS A NOTICE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE AWARD:<br /><br />The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Wildlife Services (WS) Pocatello Supply Dept. in Pocatello, ID intends to negotiate a sole source award to Neogen Corporation of Lansing, MI for 100 pounds of 3-Chloro-P-Toluidine Hydrochloride (CPTH) Lots #130161 and #130958.<br />The USDA, Animal Health Inspection Service (APHIS) intends to award a sole source Firm Fixed Price purchase order under the statutory authority permitting Other than Full and Open Competition per statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253( c )(1) FAR 6.302-1 to Neogen Corporation for 100 pounds of 3-Chloro-P-Toluidine Hydrochloride (CPTH) Lots #130161 and #130958. The property or services needed are available from only one responsible qualified source at this time and no other type of property or services will satisfy these needs.<br /><br />The Pocatello Supply Depot (PSD) manufactures several bait products used to control nuisance pests. DRC-1339 is used by Wildlife Services to control pests. Many Wildlife Services offices have contracts with local business, and individuals that require DRC-1339 to complete. If PSD does not have DRC-1339 these contracts can't be completed.
<p>The Pocatello Supply Depot would like to order 100 lbs. of 3-Chloro-P-Toluidine Hydrochloride (CPTH) Lots #130161 and #130958</p>
<p>CPTH for Pocatello Supply Depot is required to meet the following specifications:<br />&bull; 97% &plusmn; 3% purity<br />&bull; Manufactured in an EPA registered Pesticide Producing Establishment<br />&bull; Manufactured by a an EPA approved unregistered source</p>
<p>CPTH is an active ingredient in a pesticide the Pocatello Supply Depot repackages<br />under various APHIS-use-only pesticide labels (DRC-1339 Technical). The DRC-1339 Technical the Pocatello Supply Depot repackages is a registered pesticide with the EPA. EPA pesticides must be manufactured/labeled/repackaged/shipped from an EPA registered pesticide producing establishment. Virbac was the manufacturer and registration holder of DRC-1339 Technical until they sold their pesticide registrations in 2014 to Neogen. Since that time, there has not been a manufacturer of DRC-1339 Technical because Neogen,has not had the equipment necessary to manufacture the CPTH. Neogen has recently notified us that as part of the registrations and products they purchased from Virbac, they have found 100 lbs of CPTH that was manufactured by Virbac. Virbac is the only EPA approved unregistered source of the active ingredient CPTH for DRC-1339 Technical. The only supplier of Virbac's CPTH is now Neogen. Because DRC-1339 has not been available for purchase for the last 2 years, the supply of DRC-1339 available for use by APHIS WS has dwindled to the point where APHIS WS has not been able to respond to cooperators requests for assistance in dealing with wildlife related health and property damage. Fall and winter are the primary seasons for use of DRC-1339 as birds congregate during the colder weather. There is an urgent need to purchase the CPTH so APHIS WS will be able to fulfill current agreements with cooperators and provide assistance as new wildlife damage complaints arrive this fall.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is NOT a request for proposals or quotations. Request for copies of a solicitation in response to this notice will not be honored or acknowledged. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether conducting a competitive procurement is in the best interest of the Government. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability by responding to this requirement, no later than 3:00 P.M. MST on November 18, 2016, by email to Jeanine.J.Goral@aphis.usda.gov.</p>
<p>All information submitted should support the offerors capability to provide the items required, and shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government reserves the right to cancel the Sole Source Award.

<SUBJECT>B--MID-WINTER GOLDEN EAGLE SURVEY
<SOLNBR>F17PS00020
<CONTACT>DeLawder, Sarah
<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Contracting and General Services in Falls Church, VA intends to award a purchase order to Western Ecosystems Technology, Inc., 415 W. 17th St Suite 200, Cheyenne, WY 82001 to study and estimate the nesting population of the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) in part of the western United States.  This study is a continuation of a pilot survey that was conducted in 2003, modified in 2006, and continued using the same methodology through 2014 (with a slight deviation in 2011).  The 2017 survey will cover the same geographic region as was covered in 2006-2016 (with the exception of 2011).  These surveys are part of a long-term survey to determine the status and trends of golden eagles in the western United States.  Review of the first five years of the survey determined that a minimum of ten years of surveys is desirable for establishing a baseline for estimates of long-term population trends.  How to address the 2nd ten-year interval will be determined after the first ten years are completed.  This contract will provide funding for one additional year of the survey to be conducted in winter 2017, to provide further estimates of the total number of Golden Eagles in the 4 Bird Conservation Regions (BCR) covered by the survey and provide a ten-year analysis of trends of Golden Eagles of all ages and of productivity for the survey area as a whole and for each BCR.  

The proposed contract is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  

All responsible sources may identify their interest and capability for this requirement by responding to this announcement. All proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to increase the ceiling of Contract N66001-15-C-4038 to Case Western Reserve University, awarded by SSC Pacific on behalf of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Defense Sciences Office (DARPA/DSO) on 22 June 2015 for a performance period of eighteen (18) months. This effort demonstrates the feasibility of restoring natural sensation of foot contact and pressure, along with the mechanical loading of the ankle, to trans-tibial amputees by appropriately modulating patterns of electrical stimulation applied to the intact peripheral sensory nerves.  The CWRU team has demonstrated closed loop sensory feedback between implanted electrodes and lower limb prosthetic device. This groundbreaking work is advancing DARPAs neurotechnology portfolio in support of President Obamas BRAIN Initiative.  This additional effort seeks to add tasking to this effort with these specific aims: 1) extend their findings to additional human patients including an additional trans-tibial- and two trans-femoral amputees in order to validate these results, 2) determine the chronic stability of sensory perceptions, 3) map stimulus threshold, location, modality and intensity of sensory responses, 4) Perform functional testing of the effects of sensory stimulation on standing and walking balance, biomechanics and cognitive effort, 5) Integrate transducer outputs from a microprocessor-controlled leg into the laboratory based stimulation control system  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541712. Due to the nature of Research and Development efforts, DARPA could not have reasonably estimated the results of the research from this program, which has seen breakthroughs that will benefit from continued research under this current contract. This action includes a ceiling increase of approximately $970,000. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes and will be posted for 15 days. A determination by the Government not to compete based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties may submit comments in writing to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Megan Ashley, Code 22530, SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific who may be reached by telephone at (619) 553-2244 or via email to megan.ashley@navy.mil.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<p>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Subpart 6.302-1, and "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The Government intends to solicit and negotiate a firm fixed price (FFP) sole source contract for the production and delivery of technical documentation sufficient to deposit the Adaptive Networking Wideband Waveform (ANW2) into the Department of Defense (DoD) Waveform Information Repository (DoD WIR) with Harris Corporation, Tactical Communications, 1680 University Avenue, Rochester, NY 14610. Market research has concluded that Harris is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of ANW2, and did so exclusively at its own cost; therefore, Harris is the exclusive owner of all technical data, to include source code and documentation. Both the Harris proprietary source code and technical documentation for ANW2 are necessary in order to make a deposit into the DoD WIR. As a result, no other vendor can supply the necessary technical information to satisfy this requirement.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any responsible source who believes it is capable of meeting the requirement may submit a capability statement or white paper, which shall be considered by the agency, only if received by the closing date and time of this notice. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Vaginal Specula Disposable. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Vaginal Specula Disposable products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Vaginal Specula Disposable in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Vaginal Specula Disposable will be established approximately April 2017 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately May 2017 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Vaginal Specula Disposable. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Vaginal Specula Disposable.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Vaginal Specula Disposable. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $890,596.00. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Five items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 93.32% ($831,133.00) of the total volume in sales ($890,596.00). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their email submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative.

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<DESC>FBO ANNOUNCEMENT: COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION<br />ACTION CODE: &#706;COMBINED&#707;<br />CLASSIFICATION CODE: 66-Laboratory Equipment and supplies<br />SUBJECT: LTE Pico Cells.<br />SOLICITATION NUMBER: NB672050-17-00225<br />RESPONSE DATE: November 09, 2016<br />CONTACT POINTS: Dennis M. Fuentes, Contract Specialist 301-975-8088 Michael Fredericks, Contracting Officer 303-975-7763<br />DESCRIPTION:<br />THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVLAUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES <br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC-90-1)<br />1352.215-72 INQUIRIES (APR 2010)<br />Offerors must submit all questions concerning this solicitation in writing to the contract specialist within seven (3) days of the posting. All responses to the questions will be made in writing, without identification of the questioner, and will be included in an amendment to the solicitation. Even if provided in other form, only the question responses included in the amendment to the solicitation will govern performance of the contract. <br />(end of provision)<br />The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. This requirement is being competed as a total small business set-aside.<br />***The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase ** See attached SF1449 RFQ**
<p><br />Background<br />The Communications Technology Laboratory is in the process of expanding its research efforts related to spectrum sharing. This research spans a broad area covering topics associated with distributed spectrum sensing, signal propagation, interference between devices and networks, and evaluating a device's ability to share spectrum. As one of the most prolific technologies currently in use today, Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology is a significant factor in almost all proposed spectrum sharing scenarios. To research the use of LTE systems in shared spectrum environments the procurement and installation of two 5 GHz LTE pico cells is an essential part of our portfolio. These small cells will leverage the evolved packet core (EPC) already owned by NIST and be installed inside a NIST laboratory. NIST envision using these small cells for both conducted and radiated research. Radiated testing will take place inside a shielded test chamber. <br />As this is a research effort, having the ability to control the functions of the small cells is critical. The research use of these small cells also means that the typical "network-grade" reliability and redundancy is not necessary nor required. <br />The system shall meet or exceed the technical specifications identified below. All items must be new. Used or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award. Experimental, prototype, or custom items will not be considered. The use of "gray market" components not authorized for sale in the U.S. by the proposer is not acceptable. All line items shall be shipped in the original manufacturer's packaging and include all original documentation and software, when applicable.</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: SEE RFQ: NIST is looking to procure LTE pico cells that utilizes the 5 GHz ISM band. The pico cells will be installed inside a NIST laboratory and connected to a Cisco ASR 5000 series virtual EPC running release 16 of StarOS. This connection will be made via a gigabit Ethernet (GigE) running over a standard copper line. The vendor will be given access to the EPC for the purposes of installing and deploying the pico cells. The required installation, deployment, and on-going services required are described in Section III, Specifications, of the Statement of Work (SOW).<br />Because most (if not all) 5 GHz LTE deployments will be done in conjunction with deployments in other cellular bands, solutions that incorporate another band are desired. <br />In the event they are required, NIST will supply any antennas necessary to operate the small cells in a radiated manner.</p>
<p>Inspection &amp; Acceptance<br />The inspection and acceptance terms articulated in 52.212-4 will be used. The Government reserves the right to perform such performance tests and evaluations as defined below to verify specified system performance. <br /><br />Warranty<br />The contractor shall provide a limited warranty of merchantability and fitness for purpose for one (1) year parts and labor. The warranty terms include standard terms and conditions from the seller.</p>
<p>Delivery<br />Delivery shall be FOB Destination and shall occur NLT 120 days ARO.<br />FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver all Line Items to:<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology 325 Broadway Blvd.<br />Boulder, CO 80503</p>
<p>Payment Schedule<br />The Contractor shall be paid, in accordance with Net 30-day payment terms, upon receipt and acceptance of a proper invoice for the entire purchase order, in accordance with the following schedule.</p>
<p>1. 100% after receipt and acceptance by the TPOC of items, AND<br />2. After all inspection and requirements set forth in this document have been met;</p>

When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern. <br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>8. DISCOVERIES AND CHANGES TO CONTRACT:</p>
<p>Condition Found Report, Change Orders will be transmitted electronically by using email. The bullets below display the process of how these documents are to be followed for the duration of the contract performance period:</p>
<p>(a) Condition Found Report (CFR) - All readings and inspections are to be taken within 24 hours after the machinery or system is opened. All reports of reading and inspections required by the specifications shall be submitted to the COR in writing using a "Condition Found Report (CFR)" form, within 24 hours after the readings and/or inspections are made. <br />Promptness in taking and reporting readings is particularly important for underbody work items such as shaft bearing or rudder bearing clearances. Often during the progress of a work item, conditions are discovered by the contractor which are considered abnormal for reasons of safety, expected reliability, health, or habitability. These conditions must be brought to the attention of the Coast Guard using a CFR. Details provided by the Contractor in a CFR are important because the CFR may result in a contract change. To speed the contract change progress, the Contractor should include in his/her CFR the following details as a minimum:</p>
<p>(i) A sequential number.</p>
<p>(ii) The contract item which the "CFR" relates to.</p>
<p>(iii) A clear statement, definition, and description of the condition found, including but not limited to frame numbers, part numbers, materials and dimensions as appropriate.</p>
<p>(iv) A proposed or recommended repair to correct the defective condition.</p>
<p>(v) Indicate whether the report requires Cost Guard action, or if it is provided "for info" <br />only. If action is required, indicate the response time required by the Coast Guard and whether or not a contract extension would be needed if the additional work is authorized.</p>
<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>

<DESC>THIS AMENDMENT TO THE SOURCES SOUGHT IS ISSUED FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXTENDING THE DUE DATE TO 12:00 PM EST ON 14 NOV 2016.<br /><br />This is a sources sought notice only. The Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is conducting market research through this sources sought notice to identify any potential sources for developing and demonstrating methods to fabricate NyCo fabric containing covalently immobilized antimicrobial microcapsules loaded with vector repellent.
<p><br />All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Responses are encouraged from all sources who can fulfill the needs described below.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is issuing a sources sought notice to identify any potential sources for developing and demonstrating methods to immobilize multifunctional microparticles onto NyCo fabric, demonstrate wash resistance, durability of treated fabric, and retention of antimicrobial and repellent activity after treatment and laundering studies. A preferred treatment method is the covalent immobilization of multifunctional microparticles onto NyCo using textile polymers selected after judicious chemistry and formulation development. It is highly desirable that the immobilization process eliminates the need for complicated manufacturing and methods can be engineered as a factory treatment after optimization. Treatments should also not damage baseline NyCo properties (fabrics' original moisture and vapor breathability properties) while retaining permanency of microparticles. Alternate multifunctional materials and polymers may also be investigated with approval from the Government.</p>
<p><br />Parallel to microparticle immobilization methods development, NyCo fabric samples will also be made using the same methods, for use in testing by the Government. Prototype NyCo fabric specimens will be delivered to the Government for testing during optimization studies. The contractor will also be expected to perform assays confirming that their treatment methods do not compromise the repellent cargoes contained in the antimicrobial microparticles and to document methods used and results in reports to the Government. The contractor will be responsible for supplying all immobilization supplies and materials, labor, and equipment. When prompted, the functionalized microparticles will be supplied for studies by researchers at NSRDEC. Further information about the scope and nature of the desired work may be provided to qualified responders at a later time.</p>
<p><br />RESPONSES</p>
<p>All interested parties, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information. Information submissions should include descriptions of available technology, product literature, pricing bids for proposed work and relevant company background/experience. Expertise in surface modifications to NyCo and fabric treatments is desired by respondents. Responses should include information on how they might address the stated needs.</p>
<p>The results of this sources sought will be used to determine the method of procurement. Based on the responses to this sources sought notice/market research, this requirement may be set-aside for small businesses (in full or in part) or procured through full and open competition. All small business set-aside categories will be considered. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding submissions.</p>
<p><br />This is a Sources Sought Announcement and submission of information will be used for information and planning purposes only. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this notice. This notice is open to all business concerns. Informantion and materials submitted in response to this request WILL NOT be returned. DO NOT SUBMIT CLASSIFIED MATERIAL.</p>
<p><br />Submissions must be received by 4 Nov 2016. Responses to this notice should be directed to June Lum via email (contact information below). This sources sought notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be taken as a future commitment by NSRDEC. Responses in any form are not offers and the Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by respondents to this technical description is strictly voluntary.</p>
<p><br />All respondents shall include all of the information listed below in the response email:</p>
<p>1. Company name and solicitation number in the email subject line.<br />2. Company address, telephone number, primary contacts with email addresses, business size (i.e. large business, small business, SBA certified HUBZone Business, Economically Disadvantaged Small Business, Woman-Owned Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business) and proposed NACIS cod if different than 541712.<br />3. If applicable, product detailed descriptions and how it addresses our needs. This can also include current or past performance of providing these products to the Government.<br />4. Estimated cost, delivery schedule, and any anticipated discounts.<br />5. If applicable, a GSA schedule.<br />6. All assumptions, including any assumed Government support.</p>
<p><br />Interested sources must reply no later than 4 Nov 2016. No telephonic submissions will be honored. All information shall be submitted at no cost or obligation to the government Dr. June Lum, Research Chemist, Biological Sciences and Technology Team<br />Natick Soldier Systems Center, 10 General Greene Avenue, Natick, MA 01760 or via email at june.s.lum.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>UPDATE:&nbsp; 18 AUGUST 2016:&nbsp; SOURCE SOUGHT NOTICE (SSN): The Government is currently refining an acquisition strategy for the VPSS WBPS effort and anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with subsequent competitive Delivery/Task Orders for VPSS WBPS requirements, representing the best value to the Government.
<p>Joint Project Management Office for Medical Modeling and Simulation (JPMO MMS) is supplementing their initial Market Research to determine interested sources and capabilities of industry for the procurement of WBPS support services. This SSN is a follow up to the DRAFT RFP posted to FBO.gov and will supplement market research efforts and acquisition strategy. This post is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) or a commitment by the US Government.</p>
<p>The JPMO MMS intends for the VPSS WBPS Multiple Award Contract (MAC) to procure the required WBPS and all necessary support services/supplies. JPMO MMS may procure the ancillary WBPS support services and/or supplies via a VPSS WBPS MAC Task or Delivery Order without requiring the WBPS system on the same Task or Delivery Order. Delivery Orders for predominately WBPS support items will be procured via Lot I, II, or III, as outlined on the DRAFT RFP previously posted to FBO.gov. However, Task Orders for predominantly WBPS support services will be procured using a separate WBPS Lot. Pending the results of this market research, it is anticipated WBPS Lot IV will be established to procure WBPS support services for Lot I. High Fidelity WBPS, and Lot III, Veterinary WBPS.</p>
<p>Interested parties are invited to submit a capabilities statement indicating their ability to provide the products and/or services described herein. Responders are advised that the US Government will not reimburse any contractor for any information or administrative costs incurred in the response to this SSN. The contractor will assume all costs associated with responding to this SSN. Not responding to this SSN does not preclude participation in any future RFP or other solicitation, if any is issued.</p>
<p>There is no formal solicitation available at this time. No award will be made because of this market survey. If a formal solicitation is generated later, a solicitation notice will be published. All information shall be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code for VPSS WBPS Lot IV (Support Services) is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.</p>
<p>POTENTIAL REQUIRED CAPABILITIES: At a minimum, the attached Excel Workbook MUST be used in response to this SSN, indicating what capability is currently available without the need to subcontract, and the recent contract efforts that WBPS Support Service tasks were executed. For the purposes of this posting, recent is defined as performance within three years of this SSN posting date. The anticipated WBPS Lot for Support Service will be inclusive of requirements for High Fidelity and Veterinary Patient Simulators; therefore, the attached Excel Sheet combines the inquiry of WBPS Support Service Capability. Please note the Government is NOT inquiring on WBPS Low Fidelity Support Service capability.</p>
<p>For your reference, the Government has attached the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) for the base ID/IQ contract. Up to 10 additional Microsoft Word pages may also be submitted to further delineate your firm's capabilities as it relates to the requirements outlined within the Excel sheet.

<DESC>UPDATE:&nbsp; 18 AUGUST 2016:&nbsp; SOURCE SOUGHT NOTICE (SSN): The Government is currently refining an acquisition strategy for the VPSS WBPS effort and anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with subsequent competitive Delivery/Task Orders for VPSS WBPS requirements, representing the best value to the Government.
<p>Joint Project Management Office for Medical Modeling and Simulation (JPMO MMS) is supplementing their initial Market Research to determine interested sources and capabilities of industry for the procurement of WBPS support services. This SSN is a follow up to the DRAFT RFP posted to FBO.gov and will supplement market research efforts and acquisition strategy. This post is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) or a commitment by the US Government.</p>
<p>The JPMO MMS intends for the VPSS WBPS Multiple Award Contract (MAC) to procure the required WBPS and all necessary support services/supplies. JPMO MMS may procure the ancillary WBPS support services and/or supplies via a VPSS WBPS MAC Task or Delivery Order without requiring the WBPS system on the same Task or Delivery Order. Delivery Orders for predominately WBPS support items will be procured via Lot I, II, or III, as outlined on the DRAFT RFP previously posted to FBO.gov. However, Task Orders for predominantly WBPS support services will be procured using a separate WBPS Lot. Pending the results of this market research, it is anticipated WBPS Lot IV will be established to procure WBPS support services for Lot I. High Fidelity WBPS, and Lot III, Veterinary WBPS.</p>
<p>Interested parties are invited to submit a capabilities statement indicating their ability to provide the products and/or services described herein. Responders are advised that the US Government will not reimburse any contractor for any information or administrative costs incurred in the response to this SSN. The contractor will assume all costs associated with responding to this SSN. Not responding to this SSN does not preclude participation in any future RFP or other solicitation, if any is issued.</p>
<p>There is no formal solicitation available at this time. No award will be made because of this market survey. If a formal solicitation is generated later, a solicitation notice will be published. All information shall be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System Code for VPSS WBPS Lot IV (Support Services) is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.</p>
<p>POTENTIAL REQUIRED CAPABILITIES: At a minimum, the attached Excel Workbook entitlied,&nbsp;"VPSS WBPS Sources Sought Capabilities Spreadsheet_(Insert Company Name Here),"&nbsp;MUST be used in response to this SSN, indicating what capability is currently available without the need to subcontract, and the recent contract efforts that WBPS Support Service tasks were executed. The VPSS WBPS DRAFT Base SOW has been updated and is posted to this notice (Reference DRAFT SOW posted on 18 AUG). For the purposes of this posting, recent is defined as performance within three years of this SSN posting date. The anticipated WBPS Lot for Support Service will be inclusive of requirements for High Fidelity and Veterinary Patient Simulators; therefore, the attached Excel Sheet combines the inquiry of WBPS Support Service Capability. Please note the Government is NOT inquiring on WBPS Low Fidelity Support Service capability.</p>
<p>For your reference, the Government has attached the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) for the base ID/IQ contract. Up to 10 additional Microsoft Word pages may also be submitted to further delineate your firm's capabilities as it relates to the requirements outlined within the Excel sheet. The Government may not review any pages beyond the 10-page limit. The above described capability statements are due to the contacts outlined below, no later than 4:30 PM EST on Friday, September 2, 2016. Company information should include the following:</p>
<p>a) Your company name, address, POC, email addresses, phone numbers and the company's web page (if applicable); <br />b) Company capabilities and experience relative to the VPSS WBPS capabilities identified above and within attached Excel Sheet; <br />c) Identification of business size as it relates to NAICS 541990 ($15M). i.e. US large or small business, service disabled veteran business, HUB Zone, Small Disadvantaged Business, Woman Owned SB, etc.; and<br />d) Statement of whether or not your firm intends to propose as a prime contractor/team member/subcontractor.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of amendment 0001 to sources sought W31P4Q-17-R-0026 is to answer the following questions:
<p>Question 1: Would you be able to tell me if there is an incumbent contractor for this requirement? If so, could you please provide the contractor name and the contract number that was awarded?</p>
<p>Answer 1: The ALD effort is a new Army basic research project. There is not an incumbent contractor.</p>
<p>Question 2: What are the material type(s) that are desiring to be deposited as a film?</p>
<p>Answer 2: This is a new basic research effort to explore a variety of dielectric and metal multilayer composites. There is not a requirement for a specific material. <br /><br />Question 3. Does the customer have interest in obtaining standard or custom films?</p>
<p>Answer 3: This is a basic research task to explore a variety of custom films.</p>
<p>Question 4: Is the customer interested in developing new optical deposited films?</p>
<p>Answer 4: The optical properties of the ALD films are a feature of interest, the films themselves do not need to be new, but combinations of standard films can lead to new optical properties.</p>
<p><br />Question 5: How many film layers is the customer interested in depositing?</p>
<p>Answer 5: Since this is a research project here is not a specific requirement for the number of layers but the ability to produce several layers will allow for greater flexibility in multilayer designs.<br /><br />Question 6: What are the single film thickness desired by the customer?</p>
<p>Answer 6: This is a research project and individual film thicknesses will vary from a few monolayers to tens of monolayers.<br /><br />Question 7: Is the customer only interested in researching the procurement of an ALD tool?</p>
<p>Answer 7: Customer not interested in researching the procurement. Interested in procuring the ALD for a basic research project that involves the growth of thin films.<br /><br />Question 8: Would the customer be interested in external/contracted film deposition(s) development?</p>
<p>Answer 8: Possibly, as a comparison to films generated from other ALD sources.</p>

<a href="mailto:christopher.brailer@va.gov">christopher.brailer@va.gov</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following questions from prospective Vendors: 
Are we able to partner with other hotels and submit the two hotels as one hotel?  
Yes, all hotels must meet minimum requirements of 3. 5 stars per Hotels.com.  There must be one avenue of reservation scheduling for all hotels.

Both of our hotels have a total of 4 ADA rooms each, can the hotel still be considered?  
Yes. Vendor must be able to provide a minimum of 5 ADA rooms across all hotels.
3) Under Section 6   Room Rates, the solicitation states,  The Veteran beneficiary will not be asked to provide a credit card to the hotel to have on file for damages. The NF/SG VHS or veteran beneficiary shall not be liable for any incidentals, loss or damage to the property of the contractor; this is the responsibility of the contractor. No incidental expenses will be borne by the VA, nor shall the veteran be asked for any deposit or security. All incidental expenses shall be borne by the Hotel or Motel. Â 
Under Section 14   Amenities, the solicitation states,  Any amenities offered to non-Veteran beneficiary guest staying at the hotel/motel the contractor shall also offer to our Veteran beneficiaries.Â  Amenities, if not included with the hotel/motel regular night stay, shall be the responsibility of the individual Veteran beneficiary (s) (room service, pay-per view, movies, etc.). It will be the contractor s responsibility to collect payment for all non-included amenities from the Veteran beneficiary guest.  Section 6 states that the hotel is not allowed to ask for a credit card.Â  If the Veteran is responsible for amenities (room service, pay-per view, movies, etc.) as stated in Section 14, can the hotel request a credit card from the Veteran?  
Yes, but only if the Veteran asks for the amenity can the credit card be used to pay for the extra amenity.  Â Credit cards cannot be collected for damages and neither VA nor the Veteran will be responsible for damages.
4) Under Section 2   General Requirements, the solicitation states,  Vendor shall guarantee the Malcom Randall VA Medical Center a number of rooms set by the scope of work. After 5:00 pm each day, all unreserved rooms except for three (3) will be automatically released to the contractor. Malcom Randall VAMC shall not be financially obligated to pay for rooms that are not used. 
See #5Â 
5) Section B.7.2: notes all but 3 rooms are to be released if not reserved by 5 pm each day.Â  It does not note when to release the final 3 rooms however it notes the VA will not pay for unoccupied rooms.Â  Will you please clarify the release time for the final 3 rooms?  
VA agrees that if the rooms are not occupied by 7:00 p.m., the hotel can release them.  VA will not be charged for any rooms that are not reserved.
6) Section B.7.6: Â notes: Â  The NF/SG VHS or veteran beneficiary shall not be liable for any incidentals, loss or damage to the property of the contractor; this is the responsibility of the contractor. Â Â  And this one:Â   All incidental expenses shall be borne by the Hotel or Motel. Â  Â Â This first statement says that if a veteran goes into one of our rooms and destroys it you will not allow us to go after the veteran for the damages.Â  Hopefully I am misunderstanding this because we have several HOPTEL contracts and veteran do smoke in non-smoking rooms, destroy carpet with spills, and etc. so we will have to have a recourse with the veteran in some instances especially smoking.Â  I understand the VA won t pay for damages or smoking charges but we must have the right to secure payment from the veteran when they damage the facility.Â  Will you please clarify this statement?Â  Section B.7.14 notes the veterans are responsible for incidental charges but damages (to include smoking) are not mentioned. 
B.7.14 deals with charges for amenities such as Pay-per-View movies and room service. See #3 above.
7) Section B.7.7:Â  Please clarify:Â   The contractor will notify the VA representative on the contact listing, of the reservation, if it is made after 4:30 pm and on weekends. Â  Â Â We will not be making reservations unless the VA specifically requests a reservation for a veteran and that is to be confirmed in writing with a confirmation number.Â   
Correct.
8) Section B.7.11:Â  It states weekly billing; can calendar month billing be acceptable? 
No. Invoicing will be done on a weekly basis. 
9) Section B.7.12:Â   If the Veteran beneficiary is admitted or stays overnight in the VA facility, stays of family members or guests in the contracted lodging facility shall be at their own expense unless special permission is given .. Â  We would have no way of knowing the veteran was admitted.Â  
VA will pay for reservations made by VA and not canceled by VA.  The VA does not pay for family members/caregivers to lodge alone, without the Veteran in the room. The family member/caregiver will be responsible to pay.
10) Section B.7.13:Â  If the VA lodging block estimated in B.7.5 if fully occupied, will the contractor be required to honor any further reservations under the SOW terms?  
Yes, in good faith VA would like the contractor to find equitable lodging in a partner hotel within the contract, if available.  Otherwise, VA has alternative options if the contractor does not have available lodging over the stated number (35) rooms. These rooms shall be at the same contractual rate as for the block of 35. The VA removes from B.7.6 sentence 2 the phrase,  the contractor must propose as part of his/her offer, any rates above and beyond the daily room requirement. 
11) Section B.7.19:Â  Notes  When rooms are not ready for check-in within 30 minutes of arrival upon request by the veteran the Contractor will arrange for alternate accommodations that meet or exceed contract requirements and transportation when necessary at contractor s expense. Â  The solicitation does not note that check in and check out times are to be the facilities standard times.Â  If patience arrives at 9 am they cannot expect to be placed in their rooms that early and the contractor cannot be expected to provide alternate accommodations with such an early arrival.Â  We will accommodate all veterans for early and late arrival but this statement should only apply AFTER the facility check in time.Â  Will you please clarify this statement?
Rooms will be available based on the hotel standard check in time. If rooms are not available the Contractor will arrange for alternate accommodations that meet or exceed contract requirements and transportation when necessary at contractor s expense.
12) Section B.7.18:Â  Wheelchair assisted transportation, Section B.7.15 does not state the transportation is to be wheelchair compliant and Section B.7.2 notes all occupants  ..must be medically stable and capable of self-care. Â  Will you please clarify the transportation needs regarding wheelchair veterans? 
Many veterans who require a wheelchair for mobility are still capable of self-care. The contractor must have a wheelchair accessible vehicle but the Veteran and/or caregiver will assist the Veteran as needed.Â Wheelchair taxi cab is okay.
 Also, the above referenced sections note different times for transportation.Â  Will you please provide the hours also? 
4:45 am -1100pm.
13) Section B.7.23:Â  The VA has the right to terminate the contract at any time.Â  Does the contractor also have the right to terminate the contract at any time or when can the contractor terminate the contract if chosen to do so?  
Section B.7.23 TERMINATION is removed from the solicitation. 

14) Do we have to own a hotel or motel to provide the services for the Veterans or can we have an agreement with a hotel or motel to lease rooms in order to accommodate the requirements to provide housing for veterans in solicitation VA248-16-Q-1794? ALSO, is the award required to go to the host lodging facility? 
VA will only contract with a company that owns, manages, and operates a facility in the Gainesville area. 
15) Can I be awarded the contract and then secure a suitable lodging facility to be a subcontractor?Â 
 No.
16) B.7.7 on page 10 states,  Reservations may be requested as late as the day of need, in such cases, the reservation must be completed within 30 minutes of request.  In the past that took an employee to stay on the phone and not take care of anything else, so they had to hire another employee just for VA reservations and then fill in to do other work. The front desk had to continue to run. Most corporations or reservations are verified with fax or scan and done in a timely manner not a 30 minute window only.
 The contractor must have enough staff to be responsive to reservation request, cancellations, etc. A 24-hour continuously staffed Front Desk is required.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR BRAND NAME ONLY AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). 

1. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 19 (NCO 19) Rocky Mountain Acquisition Center (RMAC) intends on procuring a Berchtold Teletom boom and Flexis Boom for the Project Eagle Aurora VA Medical Center using Other than Full and Open Competition procedures. This requirement is for a Berchtold Teletom boom and Flexis Boom in order to mount and integrate with the Philips Flexvision monitor for viewing by the Physician during Invasive Electro-Physiologic Procedures.  These monitor booms are required and approved by the Philips system, but were not available with the initial purchase of the Philips EP system. The two (2) required Booms are manufactured by Stryker Medical; the Berchtold Teletom and Flexis Booms.

2. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

These specific models of booms are required as they are FDA approved and specified for use with the previously procured Philips Flexvision xl 56  large format display monitors and Philips  system interface in the EP Lab. This large format monitor display Booms is required by the Philips EP system to safely hold the weight and provide required articulation for Physician viewing and diagnostic capability & treatment. It is essential for the required Booms to integrate with the Philips FD20 EP system. This requirement is being solicited from a single source in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b) because of the urgent nature of this procurement.  If the VA is unable to get the boom plate for this support system delivered and mounted immediately, there will be delays in the construction of the EP Lab, resulting in serious injury, financial or other, to the Government.

3.  SUGGESTED SOURCE INFORMATION (Contractor Name, Address, City, State,  Zip, and Telephone Number)

Beacon Point Associates, LLC
1216 SW 4th, Suite 4, Cape Coral, FL 33991
954-391-9361
4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements; The suggested source, Beacon Point Associates, is the only contractor able to satisfy the urgency of this requirement and prevent costly delays in the EP Lab construction. Sourcing directly to Beacon Point Associates satisfies the socioeconomic requirements set forth in Public Law 109-461 s The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006.
5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
VA representatives completed market research with Amico, Maviq and Stryker.
Amico: Amico does not have a boom that is compatible with Philips Flexvision monitor.
Mavig: Mavig OEM does not sell directly to VAMC.  The VA attempted to obtain information from a source that sells and installs Mavig booms but company failed respond to the request and the VA is unable to delay this procurement any longer.
Stryker: Stryker has compatible booms with Philips Flexvision monitors and the Stryker OR Integration system. An authorized distributor of Stryker and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small business company, Beacon Point Associates, was identified as source of supply for this requirement. Due to the urgent nature of this requirement, additional Veteran-Owned Small Businesses were not sought. The Requesting Service will continue working with the RMAC in conducting Market Research for similar technology for equipment management systems.
