<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">HOW TO OFFER: </strong>The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the 'Open Period'.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website.

<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program November 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>** If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2015, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2016 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Please be sure to review each page prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the 'Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Your previous offered space will not be copied<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">.</strong></p>
