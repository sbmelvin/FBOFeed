<DESC>SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION - NASA/HQ has a requirement to acquire a renewal of membership to a unique knowledge-sharing network which provides it's members an opportunity to exchange information on project management processes and practices with over 75 worldwide organizations.  The membership in the network provides NASA with the opportunity to benchmark its project management practices, performance, results, project management competencies, workforce development and training against the membership of the network.  The membership also entitles NASA to participate in network sponsored workshops and research, and be privy to the results of research.  NASA will receive tools, reports, software and other materials developed by or for members of the network.	As a member of the network, NASA participates in selection of topics of interest for research and workshops.  Benchmarking and the development of alliances with industry organizations is a requirement of the NASA Integrated Action Team, Action 2.2, and Element B.  Further, the Office of Management and Budget has established, in OMB Circular A-119 (revised October 20, 1993), a policy to "participate in voluntary standards bodies when such participation is in the public interest and is compatible with agencies' missions, authorities, priorities, and budget resources."  Comptroller General decisions under 5 U.S.C.A. 5946 have supported use of appropriated funds for the purchase of membership fees in the Agency's name, upon an administrative determination that the expenditure would further the authorized activities of the Agency, and is not affected by any incidental.	NASA/HQ intends to purchase the annual membership from Human Systems Knowledge Network, Inc, Kent, Washington for a one-year base period with four (4) one-year options using 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The Government intends to award this contract using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:00pm eastern standard time on August 4, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<SUBJECT>Y--Design, Installation and Testing of a Deep Soil Mixed Wall, Alamitos Gap Physical Barrier Project, California
<SOLNBR>03SP300101
<RESPDATE>080803
<ARCHDATE>07132004
<CONTACT>Amy Molnar Procurement Tech 7022938779     amolnar@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation is soliciting proposals for the design, installation, and testing of a pilot deep soil mixed (DSM) wall. If the pilot test demonstrates that this type of barrier is cost effective and an effective seawater intrusion barrier, the Water Replenishment District of Southern California will install a 2.2-mile passive DSM wall in the Alamitos Gap using the pilot design. The proposed design must conform to the following criteria: (1) Construct the pilot DSM barrier by multi-stem auger gang  (2) Propose a method to demonstrate the ability of the DSM wall to function as a seawater barrier  (3) Propose a method to monitor and maintain verticality to 1:200  (4) Propose a method to dispose of any spoil which meets all applicable requirements  (5) Propose a short and long testing plan to demonstrate the effectiveness of the DSM pilot wall to function as a seawater barrier  The current Alamitos Gap seawater intrusion barrier consists of a series of 43 wells injecting approximately 6,000 acre-feet of water per year to maintain a pressure ridge to halt seawater intrusion. The water used for injection at this barrier is expensive imported water from the Colorado and Sacramento Rivers. The preferred alternative to the existing series of injection wells consists of the construction of a subterranean deep soil mixed barrier and a rubber dam. This project is known as the Alamitos Physical Barrier Project (APBP). Reclamation is interested in alternative seawater barriers as a means for water conservation. Seawater barriers which do not rely on injecting imported water either reduce imported water demand or allow for more productive use of imported water. The successful contractor shall propose a design of the pilot test barrier which clearly demonstrates the ability of the pilot DSM wall to function as an effective seawater barrier. The contractor will be responsible for compliance with all applicable Federal, state, and local environmental and permitting requirements.  Upon receiving notice to proceed from Reclamation to install the design, the Contractor will construct the test barrier and commence the short period testing phase. Reclamation may decide to exercise the option to extend the testing period to the long period testing phase if the data on effectiveness is somewhat uncertain during the short period testing. The results of the testing will be analyzed and documented by the Contractor in a technical report submitted to Reclamation.  The DSM pilot barrier will be constructed in the Los Alamitos Retarding Basin south of Westminster Avenue and just west of the San Gabriel River in northwest Seal Beach, California, in Orange County. A pre-proposal site tour will be scheduled for all interested parties; the date and time will be provided with the solicitation.  This is a full and open competition solicitation. The proposed contract is a firm fixed-price construction contract. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 237990 (Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction). We will issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) in the form of an electronic solicitation which will include a description of the work requirements, applicable soil boring data, instructions to offerors, and required certifications. Offerors will be asked to submit a technical and price proposal, which will be evaluated utilizing FAR Part 15 negotiation procedures in conjunction with the Best Value Trade-off process. Offers will be evaluated on factors such as qualifications, experience, successful past performance of similar projects, and the quality of the proposed approach to the work. The estimated issuance date of the solicitation is on or about August 1, 2003, and the anticipated due date for proposals will be 30 days thereafter. All dates in this announcement are estimates and are subject to change. The actual dates will be included in the solicitation. No documents will be available until the solicitation is issued.  The RFP will only be issued electronically via www.FedBizOpps.gov. The electronic documents will be in Adobe Acrobat PDF. The Government reserves the right to issue the solicitation on paper, CD-ROM, or by other electronic methods if the FedBizOpps (FBO) web site becomes inoperable or if the Contracting Officer determines it is in the Government's best interest to do so. Offerors should either register at FBO to be included on the offeror list in order to receive notifications pertaining to the solicitation, or visit the FBO web site after issuance to download the solicitation and any subsequent amendments and notices.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Offer (RFO) under NASA Procurement MidRange procedures on or about August 15, 2003 for a space-qualified UHF Communication Subsystem.  The space-qualified UHF Communication Subsystem will support the Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Survey (ARES) Program which is contingent upon selection of the LaRC ARES proposal under step 2 of NASA Office of Space Science Mars Scout Announcement of Opportunity (AO) 02-OSS02, and the availability of funds.	The ARES mission extends and complements the Mars Exploration Program by addressing two critical scientific themes: Near-surface Atmospheric Chemistry and Crustal Magnetism.  ARES will obtain simultaneous, contiguous, and complementary measurements of the Mars atmosphere, surface, and interior at a scale not previously achieved.  Measurements will be obtained in-situ, near the Mars surface, and over regional scale distances, yielding scientific advances in our understanding of the nature and variability of the Mars atmosphere, surface and interior.  This mission is accomplished with an airplane system in one of the most scientifically intriguing regions of Mars, the Southern Highlands.  The UHF Communication Subsystem includes a transceiver, a diplexer, RF switches, cabling and antennas.	Contingent upon selection of the ARES Proposal under the above AO, and upon the availability of funds, NASA/LaRC intends to award a contract for the UHF Communication Subsystem and other requirements as defined below. Technical Requirement: NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) intends to solicit offerors to design, develop, test and deliver a space-qualified UHF Communication Subsystem for an Atmospheric Flight System (AFS) airplane for science investigations on planet Mars. The space-qualified UHF Communication Subsystem shall be designed, developed, and tested.  The UHF Communication Subsystem consists of a dual output power level transceiver and peripheral adjunct communication components.  The transceiver shall be capable of receiving commands at 4 Kbps continuously during Mars entry through end of level flight.  The transceiver shall be capable of transmitting at a 10 Watt level from one port and a 40 Watt level from a second port (not simultaneously) to enable telemetry during entry (at 4Kbps only) and during level flight (at 4, 32, 128, or 256 Kbps) respectively.  These transceiver functions must be compatible with a similar transceiver on the carrier spacecraft and with communication assets that may be in Mars orbit.  The transceivers must have multiple-mode capabilities (various protocols, data encoding and decoding).  The adjunct components in the space qualified UHF Communication Subsystem consist of a diplexer, RF switches, cabling and two types of antennas: 1) linear polarized and 2) circular polarized. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 334220 and 1,500 employees, respectively. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  A Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract is anticipated. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9.  An ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".  All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated offer due date is 30 days after the RFO is issued. The solicitation or RFO and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/LaRC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=C&pin=23  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation or RFO and amendments (if any).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12, Acquisition of Commercial items, as supplemented  with additional information included in this notice.  An award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, No. 401813Q077A, is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service intends to issue an award for the services of a contractor to provide all labor, equipment and supplies for the control of exotic vegetation (8,240 acres)  which includes primarily Melaleuca quinquenervia and Old World climbing ferns.  However, Australian pine, Brazilian pepper, bischofia, earleaf acacia, shoebutton ardisia, ficus microcarpa, and  java plum have also become established as invasive pest species in vital wetland areas of South Florida and on the A.R.M. Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge, (Water Conservation Area 1), Boynton, FL.  Other category 1- listed invasive exotic trees should be treated if they are found in co-habitation with melaleuca or Old World climbing fern unless it is stipulated by the specific work order for a treatment area that these plants shall not be treated.  The majority of the work shall be in Water Conservation Area 1.  The REFUGE shall provide any local knowledge or other restrictions that may be applicable to the specific project location prior to the commencement of work.  Applications must be performed in such a manner as to protect non-target organisms, the environment, and the public.  Treatment sites shall be laid out in blocks, or cells approximately 103 acres in size on map coordinates supplied to the CONTRACTOR.  Blocks, or cells shall be treated systematically as directed by REFUGE staff.  The CONTRACTOR shall take responsibility for HIS CREW to systematically treat exotic plants within designated treatment zones as indicated on REFUGE supplied maps (for maps contact Helen Mitchell, (404)679-7231).  Contract crews shall avoid skipping around in delineated treatment areas.  Areas not treated, or not responding to treatment shall be required to be retreated at the CONTRACTOR's expense if it is determined that the CONTRACTOR provided faulty treatment measures.  The CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for 100% treatment of and 95% or greater control of six (6) months post-treatment of all invasive exotic plants within the delineated treatment area(s).  Ground crews can be transported by trucks and airboats, to be contractor furnished.  Once on site, ground crews shall perform treatments of dense and moderate heads, single trees, saplings and seedling.   The ground supervisor must be a licensed herbicide applicator and shall be responsible for data collection, herbicide application and inventory, herbicide safety procedures, and crew supervision.  The ground crew supervisor must also have navigation equipment such as a hand-held Global Positioning System (G.P.S.) unit, to mark areas of treatment for future references.  Ideally, all trees must be treated and treatment sites recorded at each designated location before proceeding further. The Refuge COR and Project Biologist, Bill Thomas, Jr. (561)732-3684, shall provide technical support concerning species treatments for each delineated work area.  Under no circumstances shall a non-approved herbicide, or combination there of, be used without knowledge, or permission of Refuge manager, or project biologist.  A site visit is not planned for this year's treatment location due to the vastness of the area.  In past years, Contractors have had great success renting a helicopter to recon delineated treatment areas to assist with the bidding process; however, this remains optional at the discretion of the CONTRACTOR.  Technical questions can be directed to Refuge Wildlife Biologist Bill Thomas, Jr. at (561) 732-3684 X108.   Past control methods include, but are not limited to, herbicides application and hand pulling of seedlings.  CONTRACTOR has full responsibility for systematically treating the areas indicated.  Contractor shall have valid and current licenses in the aquatic and right-of-way categories issued by the State of Florida, Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, and have a mimimum of three (3) years experience in treating aquatic and exotic species in Florida.  The successful CONTRACTOR shall be required to submit a copy of the licenses to the CONTRACTING OFFICER prior to award date.  The contractor should have sufficient equipment and personnel to treat large acreage of exotic vegetation in multiple locations simultaneously.  The contractor must be able to visually recognize pest plants when they are found in co-habitation with native plants.  This project shall be completed within 1 year (365 days) after notification to begin work from Contracting Officer.- NAICS Code:  561730, size standard $6,000,000 .

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a Raman Microprobe that can provide rapid preliminary phase characterization of ~5-20 micrometer-sized mineral grains suspended within blocks of silica aero gel.  We require a spectral resolution of 0.4 cm-1 or better, a spectral coverage of  388cm-1, or better, and data collection within a few minutes.   We require true confocal optics, which is critical for analysis of multi-component samples in the minimum time with greatest spectral resolution.	We require that the sample microscope be securely mounted to the instrument housing, minimizing vibration problems.  We require true confocal line scan imaging, which retains confocality, and maximizes system efficiency, providing a full Raman spectrum at 1-micron spatial resolution across the entire Raman image.	We require a focal length of 0.8m, or better, permitting collection of the maximum quantity of information. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the Raman Microprobe from Jobin Yvon Raman Spectroscopy Group, which is the only instrument that NASA found to be acceptable and met all the requirements. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.	See NASA Specific Note "B".

veterinarian, registration certificates, breed surveys, a full physical examination of the
candidate horse by a certified veterinarian, and other related paperwork, as applicable. A
certified Government Instructor will administer a series of tests to determine whether the
horse has the capability of working in the law enforcement environment. Each horse will
be required to pass these tests. The following are a series of tests that the Government
will conduct to determine whether or not a horse will meet the minimum requirements.
When approached, the horse must turn and face, standing quietly, especially in a confined
area. The horse must be easily haltered without giving any indications of head-shyness or
resistance to “catching”. The candidate horse must exhibit good ground manners and
remain calm when being handled. The candidate horse must stand still and calm while
being saddled. He must show no signs of aggressiveness of being “cinchy” during this
process. The candidate horse must stand still and calm during this evolution. The
candidate horse must demonstrate a proper understanding of stopping, turning and
backing with only a light to moderate touch of the reins. Excessive force should not be
necessary during this process. The candidate horse must stand quietly while the rider
dismounts. The candidate horse must load and unload from a variety of trailers without
difficulty. Balking will be a disqualifying factor when considering the purchase of a
candidate horse. The candidate horse must stand quietly and calmly while being shod or
having his feet worked on. All candidate horses must exhibit the “proper temperament”
during the entire selection process. The candidate horse must be calm when any number
of people or equipment are moving or standing around him. He must display confidence
in any number of environments, including areas of unsure footing, tight enclosed or
narrow spaces, moving vehicles/equipment, loud noises and/or bangs and popping
sounds. Although the flight or fight response is always prevalent, the candidate horse
must remain calm or quickly recover and not run off with the rider when startled. The
candidate horse must possess a gentle and calm demeanor during the hours of darkness
and around large groups of people. The candidate horses will be subjected to extreme
weather and extreme terrain on a daily basis. All candidate horses must be acclimatized
for work in this environment. The Government retains the right to return a candidate
horse to the contractor/seller, if within 60 days, the animal is deemed not suitable for
service. This determination will be based on the testing criteria specified herein or the
horse is discovered to have a pre-existing medical problem, chronic disease or a
hereditary defect that could render the horse unsuitable for service. The seller will
replace the horse within thirty days of receipt of notice that any of the aforementioned
conditions exist. This animal shall be replaced with a suitable horse that meets all the
testing criteria. The Government retains the sole right to make any and all determinations
as to the acceptability/unacceptability of the candidate. The contractor/seller shall not, in
any case, hold the Government responsible for the disposition of a medically or
physically defective horse. This Quotation is solicited FOB Destination for delivery to

<DESC>The United States Department of labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is seeking sources to conduct demonstration projects for advancing the current state of technology in detecting underground mine voids.  MSHA envisions the use of modification of geo-technical and geo-physical detection methods, but any proposed technology or method, or combination of technology and methods, will be considered.  Methods may include, but are not limited to, long-hole directional drilling, seismic reflection/refraction, ground pentrating radar, subterranean robotics, and electromagnetic methods.
On July 24, 2002 , a nonfatal entrapment accident occurred at Quecreek #1 Mine, Black Wolf Coal Company.  This incident brought national attention to a common problem in the coal mining industry.  In the United States, there have been more than 100 incidents since 1995 where miners have inadvertently broken into abandoned underground mines.  Unavailable, inaccurate or incomplete mapping of abandoned mines is typically responsible.  MSHA is planning to resolve the mine mapping issue in another solicitation.  MSHA intends to issue a solicitation that will result in the award of one, or more contracts for field demonstration of the detection methods and technology tha can be certified as acceptable standard industry practice by the mining industry.  MSHA wants to examine the capabilities of any geo-technical or geo-physical methods tha can be confidently and practically applied to detect voids and prevent inundation hazards.  The ultimate objective in support of the MSHA mission is to accurately identify mine voids in advance of mining.  These voids may present potential hazards to miners from water or gas inundation.  For example, Identifying voids and hazards can be accomplished by locating mine voids over a broad area well in advance of mining, by vertifying the boundaries of adjacent mines, and/or by locating voids a safe distance ahead of the advancing face.
Offerors who are selected to demonstrate their proposed methodology and technology will be required to document the results of the field demonstration that will be attended by MSHA personnel.  MSHA will make arrangements for location and resources needed to conduct the demonstration at the conclusion of the selection process.
Offerors who are interested in being includes on the solicitation mailing list must submit a written request to:
Darrell A. Cooper, CPCM
Director, Acquisition Management Division

The primary objective of the project is to upgrade the existing Ft. Irwin Waste Treatment Plant (WWTP) from secondary to tertiary treatment and provide a recycled wat er distribution system. The tertiary effluent will meet the StateÃ¢Â€Â™s Title 22 requirements for unrestricted access use, which will result in greater effluent reclamation potential.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237110, $28.5 M average annual gross revenue for the last three (3)  fiscal years. Estimated cost range is between $5,000,000 - $10,000,000. The acquisition method is negotiated procurement. A technical and price proposal will be required. Evaluation by the Government will result in selection of a firm that represents the best value to the Government. The Source Selection Evaluation Process will be Ã¢Â€ÂœTradeoff.Ã¢Â€Â This process permits tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal. Evaluatio n factors may consist of the following: Knowledge and experience in construction of (3) Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) Tertiary systems; knowledge and experience in elements of recycled water distribution systems; experience working with the California  StateÃ¢Â€Â™s Title 22 requirements; education and experience of staff who would be assigned to this project. The offeror shall provide information describing the companyÃ¢Â€Â™s technical capabilities; size and availability of staff; and ability to schedul e and construct complex projects.

The extension crest elevation will be +7 feet, MLW, which matches the crest elevation of the existing south jetty.  The crest width will be 15 feet w ith a front and back slope of 1 vertical on 1.5 horizontal.  Armor stone thickness will be 10 feet with core layer thickness dependent upon existing ground elevation.  A 30-foot wide scour apron will be constructed over the toe of the extension on the insi de (north side) of the jetty and will vary in thickness depending upon bottom elevation, top elevation will be set at Ã¢Â€Â“4 feet, MLW.  Both extension and scour apron will rest on a 2-foot thick layer of bedding stone that will be placed over non-woven g eotextile filter fabric.  The base of the structure will be at elevation Ã¢Â€Â“10 feet, MLW, or on existing bottom, whichever is deeper.  Armor stone size will range from 7 to 12.5 tons and will have a density of 165 pounds per cubic foot.

<DESC>Description:  SUBJECT: Education & Outreach Projects DESC: The U.S. Department of Energy?s National Energy Technology Laboratroy (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to The Petroleum Environmental Research Forum, Richmond, CA for the PERF Education & Outreach Projects as stated below. Statement of Work 1.) A requirement exists to support an EDMS pilot project in the NETL Director?s Office for a period of 90 days. Support should include telephone help desk support as well as remote system administration. 2.) There is a need to track and report against the initial due date and any extension date. Currently if an action item is extended, the original date is lost within the database. This requirement would require adding at least two fields; one to capture the extension date (date field) and a second to capture the reason for the extension (text field). Reports will have to be updated to present the extension date information. 3.) Currently information items must be closed out after a defined period of time (~60 days). There is a requirement to have an information item expire after a defined time period. This would alleviate the need to close out the item but should still leave open the option of turning the information item into an action item during that time period. 4.) There is a requirement to move documents from FileNET directly in to GroupWise as a mail attachment without having to save the document as an intermediary step. Six people currently have this need at the Director?s Office level. 5.) There is a need to have the ability to modify the system in a non-production environment. In order to accomplish this requirement the FileNET developer license (already purchased by NETL) will need to be installed and configured in a manner which adequately represents the production environment. The non-production environment will be placed on equipment to be located in Morgantown or Pittsburgh. Installation and configuration will be coordinated with NETL?s ITD support services contractor, D. N. American. 6). Develop and present a plan to move the FileNet servers from SQL to Oracle. 7.) Provide help desk support for the Director?s Office EDMS pilot. This support is expected to be equivalent to 1 ? 3 hours per day. Document the end user issues and resolutions and present documentation on the process of closing out a ?HEAT Ticket?. Train Infodesk Personnel on the Pilot EDMS system. 8.) Perform FileNET server oversight and monitoring. Ensure the SQL back-ups have been performed. Monitor connectivity; ensure the system is running at an optimal level. Review the provided server back-up log. Develop a procedure to perform the necessary server oversight and monitoring activities. 9.) Provide emergency level support for the FileNET servers in the event of a catastrophic event. 10.) In addition to the network scanners, NETL will be purchasing smaller low duty cycle scanners for Mike Neese and Denise Huenefeld. We anticipate purchasing the current NETL standard HP scanners. An analysis of the NETL standard HP scanner in light of the EDMS environment is required. If the standard scanner will not work within the environment, a recommendation for a similar priced scanner is desired. The purchase of these scanners is not part of this effort. Additional clarification and requirement request: A. Regarding item 5 above: Please provide a list of hardware and software needed to implement this non-production environment. B. Regarding item 10 above: If available, provide a list of scanners certified to operate with FileNET. This purchase order is being issued to the Petroleum Environmental Research Forum because the vendor is uniquely qualified to conduct these projects due to their prior research findings in these areas, and their ability to leverage the work with trade associations, regulatory agencies, and oil companies.  The participation in this project is relevant to the DOE mission as key areas of water and education and outreach.  The projects offer unique opportunities in that they will bring together research and/or professionals from the oil and gas industries, federal and state regulators and academia who seek solutions to environmental problems which the Petroleum Environmental Research Forum is uniquely qualified to do. This request is considered to be sole source to the Petroleum Environmental Research Forum.  Therefore, no solicitation will result the announcement. This award shall be made using FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770. The Technical Representative for the above requirement is Ms. Nancy Comstock 918-699-2059.

<CONTACT>Ms Barbara B. Lawrence, Contracting Officer 781-271-8075
<DESC>Notice of proposed contract action (NOPCA).The Government intends to award a contract for up to 314 Wind Sensor Modification Kits with two options for 100 additional kits each to Coastal Environmental Systems, Seattle, WA for a period of 4 years (inclusive of options) from FY 04 through FY 08. The kits are designed to provide an interface between legacy wind indicators, nomenclature AN/FMQ-13, and a newer R M Young wind sensor. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." Authorization to do this is contained under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)1). This contract action represents a contract for which the Government considers that an award to any source other than Coastal Environmental Systems would likely result in substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's requirements. In addition, the Contractor must currently have a working prototype of the FMQ-13 and be able to produce up to 30 systems a month for the life of the contract. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but rather a notice of the Government's intent. The Government intends to issue a solicitation on or about 11 August 2003. Award of this contract will be made on or about 22 September 2003. Additional information may be obtained from the POC/Contracting Officer listed above.  See Note 26.

<CONTACT>Cynthia E. Lewandowski, Contract Specialist, 781-271-8679 Mr. Jerome McDonald, Contracting Officer, 781-271-3906
<DESC>NOTICE OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION. It is the Government's intent to negotiate a FAR Part 15 award on a sole source basis with EADS Telecom North America, Addison, Texas for a Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) Mobile Communications Network Upgrade requirement. The existing mobile communications equipment was manufactured by European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS) of France and uses the EADS proprietary data encryption technique. RSAF plans to extend the existing EADS system (MATRACOM 9600 Mobile Communications System) used for voice and data communications. The system upgrade will use Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) equipment operating in 440 MHz-490 MHz frequency band. The end-to-end encrypted Mobile Communications Network [1] shall consist of a Secondary Switch and Base Stations compliant with TETRAPOL standard. All equipment [2] shall be fully digital, end-to-end encrypted, and interoperable with the existing MATRACOM 9600 Digital Trunking Radio System provided by EADS. The system design [3] shall be based on NDI COTS equipment. All mobile, handheld, base station and switch equipment [4] shall be modular construction using solid-state components. ESC intends to purchase 1 base station/secondary switch, 39 mobile radios, and 132 hand held radios. The Government believes that EADS Telecom North America is the only qualified source that can quickly provide the radios that meet all the threshold requirements outlined in the Systems Requirements Document (SRD). Statutory authority is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i): "only one responsible source". This notice does not constitute an RFP nor should it be construed as a Government commitment. It does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. Offerors are reminded and cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. Please direct any questions on this announcement to Mr. Jerome McDonald, Contracting Officer, 781-271-3906, e-mail: jerome.mcdonald@hanscom.af.mil or Ms. Cynthia E. Lewandowski, Contract Specialist, (781) 271-8679, e-mail: cindy.lewandowski@hanscom.af.mil.  See numbered note 22.

<RESPDATE>073103
<ARCHDATE>10152003
<CONTACT>Jerome McDonald, Contracting Officer, 781-271-3906
<DESC>NOTICE OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION.  It is the Government's intent to negotiate a FAR Part 15 award on a sole source basis for a Common Low Observable Autorouter (CLOAR) Software maintenance requirement. The existing CLOAR Software was developed by BAE Systems, Mission Solutions Inc., San Diego, CA and includes approximately 7% of CLOAR proprietary data within the software. If the proprietary code is removed the software will be unable to compile and link. Therefore, it will not be able to generate a functional executable. The F-117A program requires correction of CLOAR software shortfalls encountered during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). The CLOAR software shall incorporate the Change Requests (CRs) generated during OIF to meet the needs of the F-117A. All software shall be fully integrated with the latest Mission Planning Systems Core software. The Government believes that BAE Systems, Mission Solutions Inc, San Diego CA is the only qualified source that can quickly incorporate the fixes to the CLOAR software that the F-117A program requires. BAE Systems is the only organization that can provide uninterrupted service to ESC and the war fighter. The CLOAR software, while not difficult to learn to use, is significantly complex in architecture and algorithmic code design. Only BAE Systems possess the required in-depth knowledge of the algorithms and the inter-relationships and linkage between elements of the code and can provide software changes without breakage to collateral code and functions. A contracting vehicle is available with BAE Systems that can be utilized without significant delays. From a technical standpoint, it would take an estimated 2 years and significant duplication of costs for another contractor to come up to speed on the capability that CLOAR provides to the war fighter. CLOAR contractor personnel hold Top Secret SAR clearances required for support to Low Observable aircraft (B-2, F117, JASSM, JSF, and F-22). Statutory authority is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i): "only one responsible source". This notice does not constitute an RFP nor should it be construed as a Government commitment.  It does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  Offerors are reminded and cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government. Please direct any questions on this announcement to Mr. Jerome McDonald, Contracting Officer, 781-271-3906, e-mail: jerome.mcdonald@hanscom.af.mil.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) announces its intention to upgrade the elevator controls and select running gearing at the existing 300 North Los Angeles Street Federal Building in Los Angeles, CA. 
The facility to be renovated is located in the Civic Center in downtown Los Angeles.  The building was built in 1965 and occupied since.  The building contains approximately 1,200,000 GSF on eight levels above grade, two parking levels below grade and a penthouse on the upper deck.  There is no street side parking.
The building contains 18 elevators: four banks of four elevators each in a common shaft and two freight elevators.  Renovation work will include replacement of select running gear and replacement of the existing elevator controls.  Elevator cab upgrades will be considered as an add option.  Elevator upgrade specifications and drawings were prepared in 1995 and have been revised as of July 2003.  The demolition portion of the work may result in the disturbance of hazardous materials including asbestos and lead paint.  These materials, if encountered, will be removed by hazardous material contractors working under separate contract to the GSA.
The estimated total construction cost is between $2,700,000 and $3,200,000.  The project will be performed in phases with a total contract completion time estimated at 24 months.
The building will remain fully occupied throughout construction.  The contractor shall be required to demonstrate a certain level of expertise and capability.  The Contractor will be selected using Source Selection Procedures.  This solicitation is being made under FAR Part 15.3.  Offerors will be required to prepare fully developed Technical and Price proposals.  The contract will be a Fixed-Price Award.  The Government will not allow any stipend for preparation of proposals.  This solicitation incorporates documents, which are not available electronically.  Offerors can be a partnership, corporation, association, and/or other legal entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project.  A proposed joint venture should provide profiles for all firms in the joint venture.  Consideration for the firm is not restricted to any geographic area; however, during execution of the project a functional Los Angeles office will be required.  This procurement is open to both large and small business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Small Businesses and Small Disadvantaged Businesses are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses.  Before the award of the contract, the selected firm shall be required to present an acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with the initiatives of the Federal Government.

<ARCHDATE>07132004
<CONTACT>Dale Wilkerson Contracting Officer 6626804009     dale_wilkerson@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service is seeking contractors to remove vegetative fuel accumulations in support of the national Wildland Urban Interface hazardous fuels reduction program on the Natchez Trace Parkway.  The Natchez Trace Parkway is 450-miles long, and runs from Natchez, Mississippi to Nashville, Tennessee.  Over the past several years there has been an accumulation of downed limbs, trees, brush, etc. in many locations along the Parkway.  This material has become "vegetative fuel," capable of feeding wildfires.  Since the Parkway runs adjacent to non-federal lands, both developed and undeveloped, the threat of private property loss should a fire erupt is potentially very great.  Therefore, the purpose of this contract is to mitigate the vegetative fuel accumulation in the identified project areas to lessen the risk of losses due to wildfire, and to remove concentrations of damaged and dead vegetative fuels as a preventative measure.  The contractor(s) will be required to remove all dead and downed woody material and either haul away to an approved disposal site or chip smaller debris.  No standing trees will be cut and stump removal is not a part of this project.  There are five project areas included in this contract and contractors may bid on any or all of the five areas.  Note that multiple awards may result from this solicitation.  Project Area #1 is located near Port Gibson Mississippi in Claiborne county, with approx. 34 acres requiring treatment at an estimated magnitude between $50,000 to $100,000.  Project Area #2 is located near Ridgeland Mississippi in Madison county, with approx. 100 acres requiring treatment at an estimated magnitude between $100,000 to $250,000.  Project Area #3 is located near Kosciusko Mississippi in Attala county, with approx. 17 acres requiring treatment at an estimated magnitude of less than $25,000.  Project Area #4 is located near French Camp Mississippi in Choctaw county, with approx. 64 acres requiring treatment at an estimated magnitude between $50,000 to $100,000.  Project Area #5 is located near Cherokee Alabama in Colbert county, with approx. 53 acres requiring treatment at an estimated magnitude between $50,000 and $100,000.  This procurement is a total small business set-aside being conducted as an Invitation for Bids.  The applicable NAICS code is 113310 with an associated size standard of 500 employees. Solicitation package will be available on or about August 4, 2003.  This IFB will be issued electronically on the Department of Interior's National Business Center (NBC) web site, at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  Paper copies of the solicitation will not be made available.  Bidders desiring to conduct business with DOI are requested to register at the National Business Center.

<DESC>The USMC has a requirement for an interim capability for FLIR, EO, LTD and LST for their Lot 14-21 F/A-18D aircraft.  The proposed solution is to integrate the AN/AAQ-28(v)(3) LITENING ER targeting pod on their F/A-18D aircraft.  The LITENING targeting pod is already in use by USMC AV-8B aircraft.  A rapid integration of the LITENING pod with the F/A-18D will provide the USMC with a limited A/G LITENING ER pod capability.  The LITENING Pod will be integrated with the F/A-18D weapons systems to provide this interim capability while maintaining ATFLIR compatibility and minimizing required hardware and software changes to both the LITENING pod and the F/A-18D aircraft.

Such notification will confirm= that the offeror's technical paper addresses concept.  No debriefings of technical papers will occur. VII.  DESCRIPTION The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) is soliciting whit= e papers for innovative research and development support for the Joint Navy / National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data management capabilit= y demonstration project.  This project is in direct support to the Integr= ated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) chartered under the auspices of the Natio= nal Oceanographic Research leadership Council (NORLC). Current Federal inventory elements exist as candidates to contribute to an eventual IOOS, however= , there is no meaningful interagency demonstration that brings these components= together in an integrated, operational capabilities evaluation. The U.S= . Navy and NOAA share many common oceanographic observational and data managem= ent capabilities and user service requirements. This BAA seeks an integrate= d, joint Navy-NOAA data management capabilities demonstration. In effect the goa= l is to achieve interoperability among the pre-existing, heterogeneous systems = to provide enhanced and more efficient operational oceanographic data and information service, which is integral to the success of IOOS. VIII.  REQUISITE APPLICATIONS SPAWAR is interested in receiving a white paper from each offeror, cove= ring one or both requisite applications for any of the following: 1. When and where (outside of the US Exclusive Economic Zone) will oceanographic conditions (currents, waves, biofouling potential, etc.) indicate a hindrance to Sea Basing as defined by the Naval Transformational Road= map ? Power and Access?From the Sea? (Navy) 2. When and where should ship traffic be routed to avoid potential interactions with protected marine resources? (NOAA)

INTRODUCTION:   The Chief of Naval Operations’ (CNO) has five major imperatives, which includes people, current readiness, future readiness, quality of service, and alignment.  Commander, Naval Surface Forces, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CNSP) has identified that the imperative of alignment is not adequately or effectively measured, and that a need exists to develop a measurement and tracking system to effectively measure organizational alignment. "[Alignment] involves a couple of things. First, we must ensure that our organizations, systems, and processes are aligned to deliver exactly what they are designed to produce — a combat-capable Navy, ready to sail into harm's way. Second, alignment involves clear communication, from the recruiter, to the LPO to the CO to the CNO. It's about communicating realistic expectations and then helping Sailors accomplish realistic goals — in a word, credibility."

DFARS 252.212-7001, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items, applies with the following clauses applicable for paragraph (b):  OFFERORS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AND INCLUDE A COPY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS WITH THEIR PROPOSALS: FAR 52.212-3, Of feror Representation and Certifications – Commercial Items. The government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering the evaluation criteria and price. EVALUATION CRITERIA The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.   (I)    TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED TO MEET AND UNDERSTAND THE  REQUIREMENT (ii)    EXPERIENCE/PAST PERFORMANCE (iii)   PRICE At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's b est terms from both a price and technical standpoint.    Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, to determine if offerors understand and will be able to meet the requirements of the Statement of Work.   Under this factor, proposal will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and will not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below. Only those Offers which meet the technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii) is equal to Factor (iii), PRICE.   Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMME RCIAL ITEMS , Subparagraph (b)(10), will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information.  Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared  to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's  past performance. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>Qty 1, Deliver to Defense Distribution Depot (sb3106) Norfolk VA , RFQ N00383HYDRAUL, Approx Due Date O/A Oct 20 03--This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute an RFP or commitment by the Government. NAVICP anticipates a possible acquisition effort for a Contractor to manage a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) program in support of F14/EA6B Hydraulic Sys. Under PBL, a Contractor will manage all logistics functions of the hyraulics systems while primarily being responsible for meeting daily fleet demand requirements within a prescribed response time to CONUS destinations. A similar acquisition was recently attempted. Changes to this prior effort will be issued to companies who were previously solicited and still wish to express interest based on this notice. The anticipated acquisition effort will contain significant PBL requirement changes f rom the prior attempt. Changes are primarily in the areas of start-up, availability metric, availability response time, transportation, and pricing. A PBL method of support requires a Contractor to have assets available to meet demand. Support through production or repair is the Contractor's decision. Support through repair anticipates utilization and management of a Navy approved repair facility. A partnership arrangement with the current approved hydraulics repair facility will be considered. Developement and management of any repair process requires maintaining DOD "CORE" obligations. Additional PBL responsibilities are requisition processing, inventory management, warehousing, configuration control, obsolescence mgt. and transportation. Any resultant performance contract would be anticipated to be for a four-year base period with one or two four-year option periods. Interes ted sources should contact NAVICP by 25 July 2003 for further information. Inquiries should be directed to the Contracting Officer; Eugene Stumpo, NAVICP, 700 Robbins Ave., Philadelphia, PA 19111 or 215-697-5980.

<DESC>The Coastal Systems Station (CSS), Dahlgren Division, NSWC, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Prizm Advanced Communications Electronics, Inc., 6655-R Amberton DR #R, Baltimore, MD 21075, on a sole-source basis for two (2) each Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Fiber-Optic telemetry systems.  Basis for the sole source award is that this is a follow-on procurement. Prizm will deliver their fiber optic multiplexer systems as modified to meet the requirements of the Coastal Systems Station. Two additional systems, identical to the existing two systems, are to be fabricated. Prizm's telemetry system was identified as the only telemetry system that came close to meeting all requirements for the telemetry system component of the overall system. Prizm successfully modified their COTS telemetry system to meet all requirements. These initial telemetry systems have been successfully int egrated into the overall system. Significant costs were incurred in integrating the Prizm telemetry system into the overall system for testing of its performance and subsequent fielding. To evaluate any other system at this time would result in the duplication of these costs and a significant delay in the fielding of the follow-on systems being fabricated.  Delivery of the hardware will occur within 8 weeks of award of the order. Delivery will be to the Coastal Systems Station, 6703 W. Highway 98, Panama City, FL 32407-7001. NAICS Code 334511 applies. Size Standard is 750 employees. FSC is 6030.

<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport - US Navy currently has a portable acoustic range offshore of Little Stirrup Cay (Coco Cay) in the Bahamas.  Utilization of this range requires that a support ship be moored in a 4-point moor, and connected via a cable to a range of underwater sensors, Portable Tracking System (PTS).  In an effort to reduce the operational cost of this asset by eliminating the need for a support ship, the Navy requires the installation of an interface between the “shore end” of the acoustic range sensors and a shore location on Little Stirrup Cay.  This interface will be comprised of an optical-electrical-mechanical (OEM) cable and junction boxes.  The OEM cable and in-water junction will provide a permanent shore connection for the PTS.  The government has previously obtained all the permits and necessary environmental regulations to proceed forward with the installation.  There shall be no requirements for the contractor to obtain permits to install the cable. Work shall be performed on and offshore of Little Stirrup Cay, Bahamas and Portsmouth, Virginia.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee Completion type contract is anticipated. Award will be based on the Best Value to the Government. Offers will be evaluated on two evaluation factors, TECHNICAL CAPABILITY (subfactors: Technical Approach, Past Performance) and COST.  The period of performance is 180 calendar days from the date of award.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the government. Telephone requests will not be honored. NAICS:  541330.  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed at our web site http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.  We also provide electronic access in our Bid Room.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE REQUIREMENT
The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake intends to procure on an other than full and open basis an increase to the maximum quantity of units orderable on the contract to support the fabrication of up to 20 additional CLUSTER POINTER systems.  Each CLUSTER POINTER system contains 3 of the Power PC computer boards, 3 VX Works boot proms, 2 RACEway interface modules, and 2 VSIPL software licenses.  The purpose of the proposed action is to add 60 sets of Power PC computer boards, CLIN 0001; 60 VX Works boot proms, CLIN 0002; 40 RACEway interface modules CLIN 0004; and 40 VSIPL software licenses, CLIN 0006; to the basic contract, N68936-02-D-0039.  This brings the number of units that can be ordered under the existing IDIQ to a new total of 120 sets of Power PC computer boards, CLIN 0001; 120 VX Works boot proms, CLIN 0002; 80 RACEway interface modules, CLIN 0004; and 80 VSIPL software licenses, CLIN 0006, in order to support fabrication, testing, evaluation, and support activities through FY07.  The initial pair of CLUSTER POINTER systems is currently being field-tested and this procurement includes repair/replacements for those units.  The required specifications are detailed in the original contract. The estimated value of this contract modification is approximately $370,000 for the increased quantities.  This requirement does not call for more than the Government's minimum need and is tailored to adequately support the signal intercept and processing system (CLUSTER POINTER).  Per NAPS 5206.303-2, a review of requirements and screening of spares and repair parts was performed.  Since awarding the initial contract to Synergy Microsystems in September of 2002, the Government has invested nearly 8 man-months of software development and software/hardware integration testing in order to re-host the previously developed CLUSTER POINTER signal processing software onto the new Synergy Microsystems Power PC computer boards. There are currently 18 CLUSTER POINTER systems either delivered or being fabricated and prepared for delivery to the fleet for evaluation.  It is essential that these new items be identical to the equipment in the existing CLUSTER POINTER systems in order to provide for interoperability and interchangeability of the initial systems with the additional fabricated systems during test, as well as for common logistics support of all of the systems.  It has been determined that no other manufacturers make suitable units based on market research.  Delivery to Commander, NAWCWD, Attn: Barbara Lockman, Code 452400D, 1 Administration Circle, China Lake, CA  93555-6100, 45 days after receipt of order.

The deadline for submission of responses to this announcement is 28 July 2003.  No solicitation will be issued.  Award will be issued under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 – Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or services may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the agency.  All responses to this announcement, other than from the source listed, will be required to submit information to verify their proposed equipment will meet the requirements.  Contact Lisa Pelzl to obtain specifications.  These responses shall be submitted in writing to NAVAIR, NAWCWD, Code 210000D, Attn: Lisa Pelzl, 1 Administration Circle, China Lake, CA  93555-6100.

<DESC>The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), National Design, Construction, and Soil Mechanics Center, located in Ft. Worth, TX intends to solicit bids to develop NRCS concrete design criteria that will become Chapter 30, Cncrete, National Engineering Handbook, Part 636, Structural Engineering (NEH 636.30).  The criteria contained in the new NEh 636.30 will replace existing NRCS contrete design criteria.  In addition to the development of NEH 636.30, it is required to prepare and provide PowerPoint-based presentations on the new criteria at two workshops to be sponsored by the NRCS.  Coordination, correspondence, reproductions, workshop facilities, and notification of workshop attendees will be the responsibility of the NRCS.  NEH 636.30 will contain details for the design of conventionally reinforced and plain concrete structures and  structural elements.  Most of the NRCS structures are considered environmental or hydraulic concrete structures such as those used for conveying or storing water, wastewater, or other materials such as solid agricultural waste.  Criteria for these type structures will parallel ACI 350-01.  NRCS also utilizes traditional structures that are not required to meet the environmental/hydraulic structure standards.  Criteria for those structures will parrallel ACI 318-02.  Design information will be in sufficient detail to provide thorough design instructions and examples, along with basic concrete design concepts in a manner that is equivalent to a basic level textbook on concrete design.  All mathemathical details and examples are to be presented in both U.S. customary units and metric units.  The two workshops will be the instrument used to introduce NRCS engineering personnel to the requirements presented in NEH 636.30.  Each seminar is expected to require 2 business days.  The period of performance for the successful contract is 480 calendar days after contract award.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   Under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, the U.S. EPA, National Risk Management Research Laboratory intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) to conduct a study of resuspension of fibers from indoor surfaces due to human activity.  The contractor shall determine the relationship between asbestos concentration in carpet, and that resuspended into indoor air during human activities, i.e., walking and vacuuming. The contractor shall investigate fiber resuspension from carpeted flooring surfaces due to human  activities, relate resuspension of fibers to fiber concentration present in the carpeted surface, and relate this work to current EPA and ASTM methods for determining asbestos in carpets.  The contractor shall perform the following tasks:  (1) Select an acceptable asbestos fiber simulant; (2)  Develop/determine a methodology to deposit known quantities of the asbestos simulant on carpeted surfaces; (3) Select a representative homeowner-quality vacuum cleaner; (4) Select a real-time aerosol spectrometer and an integrated filter air sampling methodology (Nuclepore-based) to monitor total  fiber emissions and emissions at 3 vertical heights; (5) Monitor air concentrations of fibers at three heights while walking on and vacuuming seeded, carpeted surfaces; (6)  Determine concentration of simulant fibers in carpeted surface; (7) Relate emission factors for fibers to current ASTM and  EPA methods, and; (8) Prepare and deliver a quality management/quality assurance project plan and a final report.  This notice is not a request for quotations.  EPA source research indicates RTI is uniquely qualified to provided this study based on the fact it will have performed the formative work  and has the experience and knowledge critical to successfully complete this project while maintaining poject continutity and data integrity.  RTI has a unique laboratory in which it studies asbestos fibers and which is standard for all other asbestos laboratories in the United States.  RTI's indoor  air/aerosols group overlaps with the asbestos group and is trained and experienced in the area or fiber resuspension, particle resuspension, and mitigation of resuspended particles.  As asbestos and indoor air/aerosols are the two areas of expertise critical to this project, as RTI has both groups  in house, as it will already have performed the formative work for this study and, as it is critical that continutiy and data integrity be maintained, RTI is the only responsible source capable of meeting the Agency's requirements.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA  requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the statement of work.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order  based upon responses  to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13,  Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620.  The anticipated award date is 8/11/03.  See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>Engineers at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) have developed a special weighing lysimeter that is capable of accurately measuring very small changes in the mass (.01gms) of large porous bodies up to 300kg in weight.  The highly accurate weighing lysimeter incorporates a beam counter balance design and was developed to measure water absorption in fractured rocks or other geologic media.  A combination of mechanical and electronic sensors measure the inflow and outflow of water or other environmental variables over a suspended specimen and instantaneously measures absorption.   A full scale prototype has been built and is operational.  The INEEL is soliciting a joint collaboration with manufacturers of weighing equipment to explore licensing and commercialization interest and opportunity.

<DESC>On-site maintenance and repair services for 20 Campus Automated Mail Processing Systems (CAMPS) located at the nine (9) IRS Submission Processing Campuses (formerly known as Service Centers).  The CAMPS is a Bell & Howell (B&H) J 9000 S Flat and Letter Sorter.  This sorter is a version of the B&H J 9000, modified to add features and functions to meet the specialized requirements of the IRS.  The CAMPS are used to process incoming and outgoing mail on a daily basis; they automatically open, count, sort, and detect remittances.  Selected pieces of mail are automatically identified for gathering statistics.  CAMPS barcodes presorted envelopes, sorts mail by ZIP Code for postal discounts and presorts mail in accordance with U.S. Postal Service requirements.  The CAMPS equipment and maintenance and repair services were purchased under a competitive acquisition five (5) years ago which was awarded to B&H, under contract TIRNO-98-D-00036.  This B&H equipment contains proprietary software, firmware, hardware, and electronic system designs to process incoming and outgoing mail on a daily basis.  This follow-on acquisition is for the extension of maintenance and repair services for the equipment for an anticipated 60 month performance period (a Base Year, and four (4) one (1)-year Option Periods).

Interested firms are required to submit a capabilities statement showing they have the technological data and ability necessary to maintain this equipment in accordance with B&H requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, however, all capability statements received within 45 calendar days from the date of this synopsis is published in the Federal Business Opportunities will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED, ONLY WRITEN REQUESTS WILL BE REVIEWED.

Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Department of labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is seeking sources to conduct demonstration projects for advancing the current state of technology in detecting underground mine voids.  MSHA envisions the use of modification of geo-technical and geo-physical detection methods, but any proposed technology or method, or combination of technology and methods, will be considered.  Methods may include, but are not limited to, long-hole directional drilling, seismic reflection/refraction, ground pentrating radar, subterranean robotics, and electromagnetic methods.
On July 24, 2002 , a nonfatal entrapment accident occurred at Quecreek #1 Mine, Black Wolf Coal Company.  This incident brought national attention to a common problem in the coal mining industry.  In the United States, there have been more than 100 incidents since 1995 where miners have inadvertently broken into abandoned underground mines.  Unavailable, inaccurate or incomplete mapping of abandoned mines is typically responsible.   MSHA intends to issue a solicitation that will result in the award of one, or more contracts for field demonstration of the detection methods and technology tha can be certified as acceptable standard industry practice by the mining industry.  MSHA wants to examine the capabilities of any geo-technical or geo-physical methods tha can be confidently and practically applied to detect voids and prevent inundation hazards.  The ultimate objective in support of the MSHA mission is to accurately identify mine voids in advance of mining.  These voids may present potential hazards to miners from water or gas inundation.  For example, Identifying voids and hazards can be accomplished by locating mine voids over a broad area well in advance of mining, by vertifying the boundaries of adjacent mines, and/or by locating voids a safe distance ahead of the advancing face.
Offerors who are selected to demonstrate their proposed methodology and technology will be required to document the results of the field demonstration that will be attended by MSHA personnel. The awardee is responsible for making arrangements for location and resources needed to conduct the demonstration at the conclusion of the selection process.
Offerors who are interested in being includes on the solicitation mailing list must submit a written request to:
Darrell A. Cooper, CPCM
Director, Acquisition Management Division
Room 2132
Mine Safety and Health Administration
1100 Wilson Blvd.

<DESC>UPDATE (15 JUL 03): The site visit has been rescheduled from 17 Jul 03 (1:30) to 18 Jul 03 (9:00). Project Number 981911A: Renovate for DPC, Facility 30002 (Base) Project Number 981911C: Provide Furniture for DPC Fac. 30002 (Option I) Project Number 981911D: Relocate/Utilize Existing Furniture for DPM, DPF,                            MSS Fac. 30002 (Option II) Solicitation Number F33601-03-R-0047 The scope of this project consists of furnishing all materials and performing  all labor required to complete the three-phase renovation, purchase and  installation of new furniture in the DPC area, and relocate an utilize the  existing DPM, DPF, and MSS furniture in Facility 30002. The scope will also  include the architectural, electrical, environmental, fire protection,  mechanical, and plumbing modification and reconfiguration of Bays 1, 2, 3, and  4 in Facility 30002 to meet the functional requirements of multiple service  organizations. The overall estimated price range is between $5M and $10M.  The  Base Line Item is estimated between $1M and $5M, and the two Option Line Items  are estimated between $1M and $5M (combined).  The NAICS Code is 236220.  The  size standard is $28.5M.  This is a RESTRICTED procurement for 8(a) Small  Business Concerns certified in Region 5, Kentucky, West Virginia, and  Pennsylvania.  This is in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness  Demonstration Program Act of 1988, Public Law 100-656 (15 U.S.C. 644 note). In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, contractors must be registered in the  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of solicitations issued  after 31 May 1998.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov, or  telephone at 1-888-CCR-2423.  Every solicitation issued after 31 May 1998 must  include the clause at DFARS 252.204-7004, "Required Central Contractor  Registration." SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: Facility 30002 is being  renovated to house the main administrative offices and  customer service areas for the personnel management  organizations servicing both the military and civilian  population of WPAFB.  The main organization currently  housed in this facility is the military personnel office.   Since this office will remain in operation during  construction, minimizing the impact to this mission will be  a critical concern.  The extremely high level of visibility  of this project will result in an unusually high level of  scrutiny by all levels of WPAFB leadership.  The building  currently occupied by the civilian personnel office is  scheduled for demolition.  This major renovation will  involve the complex management of numerous disciplines  (inlcuding the installation of sytems furniture), working  simultaneously, and critical phasing and scheduling  requirements.  The contractor must have extensive  experience in the management of large multi-disciplined  projects in order to successfully complete this effort.   Failure to supervise and coordinate the different trades  required to provide a quality and timely product will not  be acceptable as it would result in the disruption of the  long range plans for the using organization.  This would  trigger a "domino effect" which will negatively impact the  long range plans of several other organizations. NOTES: (1) The solicitation, specifications, and drawings will be available on the  website on or about 7 July 03, at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil. (2) Hard copies of the solicitation will NOT be provided.  However, you may  download and print the file from the website. (3) There is no fee for this solicitation.

If you  have not registered, it will be your responsibility to check the website for  any changes to the solicitation. (6) Contractors shall be capable of securing bonding for the total proposed  amount (base plus options).  However, contractors shall only be responsible for  providing bonding for the base amount plus the amount of any/all options  exercised at the time of award.

WRITTEN EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FOR CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE FOR A NEW US COURTHOUSE, FT. PIERCE, FLORIDA  

WRITTEN EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FOR CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW U. S. COURTHOUSE-FT. PIERCE, FLORIDA-GS-04P-03-EXC-0033. The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in public construction and is presently soliciting written expressions of interest and assurance of bonding capacity letters from qualified general contractors (GC) desiring to compete in the procurement process for the subject construction project. GSA intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract, utilizing successive target prices throughout the source selection process, to obtain the GC that offers the best overall value to the Government. The selected GC must demonstrate a commitment to construction excellence, proposing and maintaining a viable team organization and by adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project. The Government will utilize the Source Selection process in accordance with FAR Part 15.1, Best Value Continuum-FAR 15.101, and the Tradeoff process FAR 15.101-1 to select the GC that offers the best overall value. The site selected by the Government for the new United States Courthouse will be in the Central Business District of Ft. Pierce, Florida. The facility will include approximately 10,994 square meters (118,334 gross square feet) including 34 secure (inside) parking spaces and 73 on-grade parking spaces. The facility will be occupied by the Federal District Court,  Magistrate Court, Bankruptcy Court, District Clerk, Probation, Pretrial Services, Federal Defender, U.S. Attorneys Office, U.S. Marshals Service and the GSA.  The estimated total construction cost for the project is estimated to range between $25,000,000 and $26,500,000 with occupancy planned for 4th quarter of FY 2007. This procurement is advertised on an unrestricted basis with an approximate construction time of 545 calendar days. The North American Industry Classification System Code (s) (NAICS) for this procurement is 233220. The project will be in Metric Units of Measure. Utilizing FAR Part 15 and formal Source Selection procedures the GC will be competitively chosen. The Trade-Off process at FAR Part 15.101 allows award to other than the lowest priced proposal therefore, participants are urged to submit all proposals on their best terms possible as it is the Governments intent to make award without discussion in accordance with FAR 15.306 (3), Qualified offerors electing to participate in the name of newly formed partnerships, corporations, joint ventures and/or any other business entity or arrangement will be required to provide the government with legal proof of union upon submission. Under this procedure all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price (15. 101- a (2), thereby magnifying the importance of each offeror’s past and present stated ability to perform at a very high rate of technical competence and to submit all offers on the best terms possible. The procurement process is structured in 4 Stages as follows: STAGE I- In order to become eligible to compete for the award of this project qualified GCs must, within 30 days of the publication of this notice or no later than Close Of Business (COB) August 18, 2003, submit a one page letter of interest (include an address and point of contact that you wish the subsequent RFP package to be mailed) along with a statement letter from a bonding corporate surety, on their (the surety’s) letterhead, certifying their ability to obtain bonding capacity commensurate with the Estimated Construction Cost of at least $26,500,000 (Ceiling Price). Corporate sureties offered must appear on the list contained in the Department of Treasury Circular 570 “Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Reinsuring Companies or Acceptability of Individual Sureties” in accordance with FAR 28.202 and 203 (http://www.fms.treas.gov/c570/index.html). These two letters (letter of interest and bonding) must be submitted to the attention of Mr. R. Butler, Sr. Contracting Officer, General Services Administration, Property Development Division, 25th Floor, 401 West Peachtree Street, N.W-Atlanta, Georgia 30308–again, no later than COB August 18, 2003. In order to facilitate the milestones set for the project and the sequence of events relative to convening the formal Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) and other activities, offerors failing to submit the required Stage I data as required and in the timeframe stated will be ineligible to compete for this procurement. Late and/or incomplete submissions will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.214-7 and may render the offeror ineligible for further participation. Electronic submissions (faxes, e-mails, etc.) are not allowed during any stage of this process. STAGE-II-upon notification from GSA via Request for Proposal (RFP), offerors responding accordingly to Stage I will be required to submit, under separate cover, a target price (Cost and Profit separated) (IMPORTANT NOTE: In order to assist in maintaining the ceiling price and related budgets, Profit Percentages offered in Stage II must remain constant throughout the process and will not be subject to change throughout the various pricing stages for those selected. The amount of profit may change due to cost fluctuations but not the proposed percentage),  based on approximately 20%-35% completed concept documents (provided in the RFP) and technical evaluation factor data relative to this project as follows: (1) Past Experience (2) Past Performance , (3) Key Personnel Data  and (4) Project Management Plan-Technical Approach-Accounting System-Management of Extended Overhead Cost . Details and expanded versions relative to these factors will be contained in the subsequent RFP package. STAGE III-Following the receipt and scoring of the Stage II data and the evaluation/analysis of the price proposal, a shortlist of not more than three offerors will be selected and provided an agenda to compete in an evaluated  Interactive Project Participation Stage whereby they will be required to independently participate in a (5) Value Engineering Workshop(s) for at least 3 days with a maximum of three (3) attendees from each firm eligible to participate and to submit (6) Cost Saving Ideas and Concepts ,complete a (7) Constructability Review(s) and at least one (8) Independent Estimate during design development . The participants will be paid a pre-determined moderate stipend for these services. Upon completion and scoring of this stage the participants will again be asked to submit a target price (cost and profit) (same profit percentage as Stage 1) at approximately 50%-65% design completion along with a subcontracting plan (large businesses only) relative to the proposed price. The SSEB will then combine the target price along with the previous technical scores from each previous stage to select the participant that offers the best overall value to the Government by establishing a firm target price and a commitment to not exceeding the ceiling price of $26,500,000. Stage IV-(Award-CM Services) during this stage the selected GC will work in equanimity with the A-E of record, via a written contractual agreement, not to exceed the pre-determined amount (amount included in RFP) to be paid following contract award, to finalize the design to 100% completion within the committed ceiling price. Upon design completion the Government will negotiate with the selected contractor to establish a Firm Fixed Priced contract noting that the submitted profit percentage remained unchanged. Should negotiations between the final selected GC and the Government reach an impasse the Government, in accordance with FAR 15.405 (d), will refer the matter to a level above the Contracting Officer and request permission to undertake negotiations with the next highest ranked previously short-listed offeror. Award will be based on availability of funds in accordance with FAR 52.232-14. Prior to the Interactive Participation Stage III and submission of price proposals a Pre-Proposal Conference and a Socio-Economic Program Meeting (networking session) will be scheduled with offerors to entertain inquiries concerning the scope of work and related issues. The networking session allows for the marketing and exchange of information with small businesses with potential prime contractors to facilitate marketing opportunities, business ventures and employment opportunities. Prior to award of this contract to a large business a subcontracting plan must be negotiated in accordance with FAR Part 19 which demonstrates a proactive effort to achieve the following minimum small business goals for all subcontracted work: Total Small Businesses (40%), Small Disadvantaged Businesses (8%), Small Women-Owned Businesses (5%), Service-Disabled Veteran (3%) and HubZone (2.5%). All submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number (GS-04P-03-EXC-0033) on the face of the envelope.  Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.215-10.

5.	MARKET VALUE:			$61,251 - $79,629 per annum  (GS-13 equivalent) with 25% Post Differential  	
6.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	Two years (renewable) 
7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/CENTRAL ASIA, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan 
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:

A.	BACKGROUND

Central Asia borders Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan.  Due to its location amidst these neighbors and its substantial oil and gas reserves, Central Asia is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.   With a total population of 55 million and dozens of ethnic groups, the five new nations of the region are emerging from isolation and almost two centuries of Russian domination.  A recent civil war, threats of religious extremism, ethnic rivalries, authoritarian governments, and lack of viable institutions make Central Asia a particular challenge for USAID.  The region is considered a Foreign Service hardship post -- 25% post differential for Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.  

USAID's Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible, in close consultation with the five U.S. Ambassadors in the region, for the design and management of USAID assistance programs in five republics.  The central office is located in Almaty, Kazakhstan with offices in Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Osh, Kyrgyzstan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  USAID/CAR is one of the Agency's largest Missions responsible for approximately $90 million of assistance annually, with activities totaling $400 million in the areas of energy and environment, economics and finance, democracy and media, and health and humanitarian assistance.  Mission works in partnership with over 70 grantee and contractor teams.  

The office in Bishkek, led by the Country Representative, includes a team of three USPSCs and 12 local national technical and administrative support staff that will manage a program with a budget of approximately $42.5 million in FY 2003.  They oversee, with technical guidance from the USAID Regional Office, 30 in-country contractor/grantee teams and 5 non-resident teams. These teams work in a variety of development areas including education, agribusiness, fiscal reform, land reform, trans-boundary energy and water, agriculture, private sector development, local government reform, democracy, media, health, judicial reform, human rights, banking, credit, trade and investment, small and medium enterprise development, and civil society and NGO development.  The assistance provided in these programs seeks to expand opportunities for participation, livelihood and quality of life for the citizens of the Kyrgyz Republic. 

B.  STATEMENT OF DUTIES

BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSITION

The USPSC Democracy Specialist is located in the USAID/CAR/ Kyrgyzstan Country Office. The employee serves as the Mission’s Democracy Specialist for democracy activities implemented in the Kyrgyz Republic.  Work involves a full range of project and program design, activity monitoring, data collection, political, conflict and social analysis and program evaluation in the democracy sector in the Kyrgyz Republic. 

The employee is responsible for monitoring and managing USAID/CAR/ Kyrgyzstan initiatives in the democracy sector. As such, the employee must have considerable knowledge of political, social and cultural developments of Central Asia, a background in democracy, media, NGO, and local government development programming.  The Employee must be effective in developing and cultivating cooperative working relationships with American and international PVOs, NGOs, local non-governmental partners and government officials in the Kyrgyz Republic. In addition, the employee works closely with and coordinates USAID programs with the U.S. Embassy, in which his/her office, will be housed. The Democracy Specialist will also be expected to provide rapid response to request from the Ambassador related to USAID programs and program areas. The employee will supervise activities of the USAID/CAR/Kyrgyzstan project management assistant for democracy and media. The employee will provide the assistant with training, mentoring and feedback on performance. 

MAJOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

<CONTACT>Terrance Vickerstaff, 256-876-4682
<DESC>NA 1.  Purpose The United States Army, through the TOCs/AMDCCS Project Office, Huntsville, AL, has a requirement to design, assemble, integrate, test, train, and support the Command Post Platform (CPP) Development and Integration program.  The objective of this acquisiti on is to satisfy the Threshold and Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) requirements of the Standardized Integrated Command Post System (SICPS) Operational Requirements Document (ORD). 2.  Overview a.  CPP Development and Integration Program Description The CPP Development and Integration Program includes three CPP variants (Track, Rigid Wall Shelter (RWS), and Light), a Company Level Command Shelter (CLCS), and the Command Center System (CCS) that ground commanders can use as building blocks to form Comm and Posts (CP) at various echelons. The CPP variants are flexible, multi-functional, integrated vehicles and shelters that host multiple battle command and support software suites and interface with numerous non-battle command vehicles.  A single CPP can serve as a stand-alone CP or complex with other CPPs to form the digital network infrastructure for any echelon CP.  The RWS CPP consists of the RWS Platform Assembly, with the integrated C2 Assembly, mounted onto an M113 Expanded Capacity Variant (ECV) High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehi cle (HMMWV).  The Light CPP consists of the Light Platform Assembly, with the integrated C2 Assembly, mounted onto either an M998 Light Tactical Vehicle (LTV) HMMWV or an M1097 LTV HMMWV.  The Track CPP consists of the Track Platform IK, with the integrate d C2 Assembly, installed into the M577 or M1068 variants of the Family of M113 Track Vehicles. The Command and Control (C2) Assembly is a common suite of electronics used within any CPP consisting of the computers, networking systems, communications equipment (including radios and the Command Post Communication System (CPCS)), and signal interfaces necessary to (1) host multiple Army Battle Command System (ABCS) and/or Global Combat Support System Ã¢Â€Â“ Army (GCSS-A) applications and modules; (2) enable the critical ABCS and GCSS-A information exchange requirements (IERs); and (3) provide local area  networks (LANs) that operate at SECRET and/or Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU).   The basic C2 assembly infrastructure will be constant across all CPPs.  Specific suites of computers, networking systems, communications equipment (including radios, CPCS, a nd signal interfaces) will be tailored within CPPs based upon the type unit and echelon of command each CPP is to be fielded to.  The C2 Assembly will interface with a platform assembly that ports the C2 Assembly to a specific variant vehicle. The RWS Platform Assembly, Light Platform Assembly, and Track Platform Installation Kit (IK) consist of the housing system, the environmental control system, tent connection interface, power system, grounding system, and C2 Assembly interface.  The contrac tor shall perform an architecture trade for the RWS and Light Platform or propose a shelter solution.   The contractor shall compare assemblies between existing shelters and new shelter development to determine the most economic solution.  The contractor s hall design a modular platform assembly such that the RWS and Light Platform Assemblies use the same shelter.  The RWS Platform Assembly shall be manufactured with only the addition of the auxiliary power unit and environmental control unit.  The Track Pla tform Installation Kit (IK) is a kit designed to meet the operational requirements and instantiate the common C2 Assembly.   The CLCS provides a sheltered workspace capable of supporting installation kits of Army standard C2 equipment (i.e., tactical radios, Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) computers, etc.) for company and troop level CPPs.  The CLCS Platform A ssembly consists of the housing system, tent connection interface, power system, grounding system, and C2 interface.  The contractor shall perform an arc hitecture trade for the CLCS Platform Assembly between existing shelters and new shelter development to determine the most economic solution.  The CLCS consists of the CLCS Platform Assembly mounted onto either an M998 Light Tactical Vehicle (LTV) HMMWV or  an M1097 LTV HMMWV. The Command Center System is a collection of audio/video collaborative planning devices and consists of the Large Scale Display with controller and may include audio input/output devices that allow the CP personnel to interact with the CPCS in those CPPs e quipped with the CPCS. b.  Basic Contract Effort The contracting strategy calls for a negotiated procurement with full and open competition, for the design, development, production, integration, testing, training, and logistics support of the CPPs, CLCS, and CCS.  Acquisition streamlining procedures will  be used where possible.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal is determined to offer the best value to the Government. The contract will include: 1.	Design, development, prototype, and verification test of the CPPs, CLCS, and CCS, and will be a cost-plus-incentive-fee effort.  The contractor shall deliver three (3) RWS CPP prototypes, three (3) Track CPP prototypes, two (2) Light CPP prototypes, and  two (2) CLCSs.  The prototype systems will be used for contractor and Government developmental testing/limited user testing (DT/LUT) leading up to a Milestone C Decision authorizing entry into Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP). 2.	Production, integration, and unit fielding and will be structured as indefinite-delivery-indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) fixed price orders.  Fielding will occur in accordance with the Army Modernization Schedule.  The contract will also include interim cont ractor support (ICS), training, and Government test support.  LRIP systems will support Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) leading up to a Full Rate Production Decision Review.  In addition to IOT&E, the LRIP effort will also serve to prove ou t the production/fielding strategy for full rate production. 3.	Engineering services for special studies, vehicle platform engineering, and exercise and test support, which will be issued on a task order basis.  This will allow flexibility in investigating technologies, as well as work with other Program Offices in realigning their shelters into the CPP concept. The solicitation/contract will include several special provisions and clauses.  The first special provision will assign Total System Responsibility to the contractor.  This provision will require the contractor to fully integrate the various system compone nts, regardless of the source (NDI, COTS, CFE, or GFE) onto the various vehicle platforms.  A second special provision will detail the contractor's responsibilities for receiving inspection, maintenance, storage and security of Government Furnished (GF) ve hicles.  This provision will complement the requirements of the Government Property (Cost Reimbursement Contracts) clause (FAR 52.245-5) included in the contract. 3.  Schedule The program schedule is very aggressive, requiring the First Unit Equipped (FUE) in FY 06 to support fielding Stryker Brigade Combat Team 5 (SBCT Ã¢Â€Â“ 5), followed by SBCT-6 also in FY06.   The contract will also procure the integration and fielding of C Ps using unit provided equipment.  Units to be equipped using this process include SBCT-4, 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division (3/4 ID) and possibly the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment.  The selected contractor will have approximately thirteen  (13) months to design, develop and prototype the RWS CPP, while starting a concurrent design verification test effort.  The contractor must hold a complete system requirements review within sixty (60) days of contract award.  The Army Modernization Schedule (AMS) windows  will govern the delivery and training schedules for this contract.  There will be other units fielded per the army modernization strategy that is still TBD for the CPP progr am. 4.  Scope of Work a.  Program Management The contractor will require highly skilled program management capabilities to manage and execute the program.  The contractor will need to be very familiar with the interface and interoperability challenges that face the  digitized  Army and that must be o vercome to meet the Army's Transformation Vision.  The contractor will need to have oversight over all subcontractors.  The contractor must be able to manage a design program of various platform types and C2 equipment within an aggressive schedule.  The co ntractor must be able to develop test plans and procedures, address safety throughout design, and produce technical manuals and modification work orders.  The contractor must have in place an earned value management system that helps control costs and dete ct any problem areas.  The contractor must work and manage to an integrated master schedule that includes all disciplines, is regularly updated, and helps determine program risks. b.  Design, Production, and Integration The contractor shall design, develop, prototype and test the CPPs, CLCS, and CCS.  The Performance Specification (MIS-PRF-54581) will govern the requirements of the CPPs, CLCS, and CCS.  The requirements of the performance specification are to (1) standard ize electronic suites and interfaces to reduce training burden on soldiers transitioning between units; (2) merge developmental, commercial, and Government-furnished items with other leading edge technologies to field  digitized  CP vehicles that do not co nstrain the performance of the base vehicle; (3) eliminate CPP variant unique parts to ensure commonality and reduce logistics burden on units; (4) achieve full system performance while ensuring C2 interoperability and CP mobility; and (5) constantly seek to reduce set-up and tear-down times. The CPP variants will be transportable by C-130 aircraft, with minimal modification to the Track CPP allowed.  Additionally, the Light CPP and CLCS will be transportable by UH-60L helicopter.  Each CPP variant will provide at least five (5) and up to seven  (7) operators positions which remote into the CP tents.  Each operator position will have a human-computer interface device, and provisions for mounting a CPCS access unit, headset and microphone.  Each CPP variant will include an on-the-move operator pos ition in the HMMWV cab for the RWS and Light CPPs and inside the prime mover for the Track CPP.  The contractor will also consider the environmental conditions, transportability requirements per MIL-STD-1366, electromagnetic environmental effects, system s afety, power management, setup and teardown times, reliability, and maintainability.  The contractor will design and develop interfaces with Government-Furnished Property (GFP) such as the voice and data radios to include the Secure Wireless LAN (SWLAN) sy stem, the ABCS/GCSS-A software, the LTV and ECV HMMWVs, the M577 and M1068 Track Vehicle variants, and the Quick Erect Antenna Mast (QEAM).  The contractor will develop a fault isolation/fault detection scheme, which will report failures to individual oper ator positions and allow fault isolation to line replaceable units, including GFP.  This scheme can include software or hardware, COTS, contractor-developed, or a combination thereof. The contractor will perform a series of trade studies to finalize (1) the small computer/server farm to host the multiple ABCS/GCSS-A applications; (2) the network architecture and security to provide the LANs and to enable Echelon-independent CPPs; (3) sh elter systems for the RWS CPP, Light CPP and CLCS; (4) operator and large scale displays; and (5) Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) contamination and decontamination requirements.  The contractor will present the results of the trade s tudies prior to the Preliminary Design Review (PDR), and the Government will approve the approach at PDR.  Each C2 Assembly end item (non-radio) will be transitioned to the Commo n Hardware System catalogue.  The Government will approve the product baseline at the Critical Design Review (CDR). The contractor will manufacture or procure the assemblies and kit base lined at CDR. The Government will place delivery orders for assembly and kit quantities based on Unit requirements.  The contractor will integrate the C2 and platform assemblies/kit as much as possible and perform an acceptance checkout on each.  The Government will provide a System Architecture (SA) to the contractor to address the radio complements, ABCS/GCSS-A distribution, computers, networking systems, communications equipment (incl uding radios, CPCS, and signal interfaces).  As the Unit fielding schedule opens, the contractor shall interface with each Unit to review the CPP concept and assess GFP condition.  The contractor shall conduct a joint inventory with the Unit and Government  representatives, receive GFP, integrate GFP and platform assemblies/kit, conduct acceptance verification of each CPP, conduct acceptance verification of the core Command Post infrastructure (CPPs/Tents/CLCSs complexed together), deliver to Unit, train, an d provide ICS. c.  Integrated Logistics Support During the design and development of the CPPs, CLCS, and CCS, the contractor shall develop provisioning data for maintenance of critical assemblies and subassemblies, and logistics management information (LMI) necessary to support a depot maintenance study  and development of the technical manuals.  The logistics data will support a Logistics Demonstration, which will validate the technical manuals and support concept. Interim Contractor Support (ICS) will be utilized starting with the delivery of the first CPP within a Unit Set Fielding (USF) window and continuing for six (6) months past the end of that USF.  Spares will be provided to the gaining unitÃ¢Â€Â™s support ac tivity as part of a Prescribed Load List (PLL), Authorized Stockage List (ASL) and the total package fielding process.  Spare types and quantities will be determined using failure factors, locations, and densities per location as part of the provisioning p rocess.  During the ICS period of performance, the contractor will be responsible for providing the appropriate quantities of spares and turning this spares package over to the unit Class IX Accountable officer upon completion of the six month long ICS pro cess.  The GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s intention is for the contractor to complete all ILS deliverables prior to fielding CPPs to a Brigade or Regiment sized unit.  Upon completion of the six month ICS period of support, units should be self sufficient to operate an d maintain the CPPs without additional ICS.  The contractor may be required to partner with the Communication Electronics Command, Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) to ensure a smooth transition to organic field/depot support (90 days after fielding to each unit /CPP). The ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s Systems Approach to Training (SAT) process will be used for development of the training program.  The ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s Automated Systems Approach to Training (ASAT) will be used for creation of individual tasks and lesson plans.  Interactive Mul timedia Instruction (IMI) training will be developed for operator and maintainer training.  The contractor will provide a New Equipment Training (NET) Team during fielding. d.  Product Assurance and Test The Test and Evaluation concept includes test events conducted by both the contractor and the Government to ensure that the CPPs, CLCS, and CCS meet performance requirements, is safe for use by soldiers, is operationally suitable and effective, interoperab le, and qualified for use on the prime mover vehicles from the family of M113 Track vehicles and the family of Light Tactical and Expanded Capacity Light Tactical Vehicles.  During the system design and integration phase of the program, the prototype platf orms and system will undergo contractor developmental testing (DT).  These prototypes will also support Government developme ntal qualification testing, interoperability testing, and possibly a limited user test.  These tests will provide the basis for approval of entry into LRIP at Milestone C.  The LRIP systems delivered under the contract will support an IOT&E leading to a fu ll rate production decision. The contractor shall be required to develop a product assurance and test program that ensures the delivered CPPs, CLCS, and CCS meet performance specifications and is safe for soldier operation.  The Government will make maximum use of contractor test even ts and the resulting data to fulfill DT requirements.  The contractor shall allow Government participation and monitoring of all phases of the Product Assurance and Test (PA&T) process. A Test and Evaluation Working Integrated Product Team (T&EWIPT) will be established as the focal point for test management.  T&EWIPT membership will include all organizations having direct or indirect testing responsibilities.  These organizations include:   PM TOCs/AMDCCS, Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), DCMA, and the Joint Interoperability Test Center (JITC).  The T&EWIPT will prepare a Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP) to verify the operational suitability and effectiveness of the CPPs, CLCS , and CCS as compared to the requirements of the SICPS ORD.  The contractor will participate in the T&EWIPT activities. e.  Configuration Management The contractor will implement a configuration management program to deliver data, manage the program baselines (allocated and product), plan and perform the configuration audits, and create and monitor change proposals to the baseline approved at CDR. The contractor shall furnish all unclassified data delivered or data made available during this contract electronically by uploading digital files to a Government-specified web site.  The contractor shall conduct an FCA with Government witness to verify that t he product baseline adequately reflects the requirements of MIS-PRF-54581.

I. POSITION DESCRIPTION

 
Introduction

The Office of Transition of Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority, conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.

OTI uses such mechanisms as support for development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent material needs; aid to independent media outlets; and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/hum_response/oti/


Country Background

In 1998, Hugo Chavez was elected by an overwhelming majority of voters on a platform to address the problems of the poor and address corruption.  Over the past two and a half years his popularity has waned and political tensions between the government and the opposition have risen dramatically as President Chavez has attempted to implement several controversial reforms. 

In the past year, Venezuela has experienced several dramatic events that highlight the fragility of democracy in Venezuela, including a failed attempted coup in April 2002 and a 10-week general strike.  Venezuela’s democracy remains at risk, the result of a steady weakening of political institutions and decreasing public faith in government institutions, civil society and the press.  Support for democracy remains the Unites States’ top foreign policy priority in the hemisphere and in Venezuela.  In his speech last year to the Council of the Americas, Secretary of State Powell said “people are losing faith in their political leaders and systems” around the hemisphere.  Nowhere is that more true than in Venezuela.  

The United States has an abiding interest to ensure that Venezuelan democracy, which took root following the 1958 overthrow of the Perez Jimenz dictatorship, endures and strengthens.  For democracy to remain viable, support is needed for the institutions that provide for checks and balances, and ensure the protection of human rights and free expression of ideas, including, at both the national and local levels, by the media, civil society, political parties and government institutions.

Support is also needed to promote dialogue between groups that have little trust in each other.  Space for political dialogue is at a premium and support for initiatives to move dialogue forward in a productive and effective fashion are essential to reduce the increasing societal tensions and advance an agenda for governability.

The current political situation is critical and cannot be sustained for the long-term.  The ability of foreign assistance to influence events is limited; nevertheless, the U.S. government is attempting to encourage the opposing sides to debate issues in a civil and rational fashion.  

The recent signing of an OAS-brokered agreement between the government and the opposition offers hope that peaceful, constitutional democracy will continue to endure.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) seeks to identify small businesses which perform services classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 238220.  The small business size standard for this Code is less than $12 million dollars in average gross annual receipts. The qualified firm would furnish all management, supervision, labor, supplies, materials, equipment and tools required to perform the Mechanical Maintenance functions at either the Southeastern Program Service Center (SEPSC) in Birmingham, Alabama or the Northeastern Program Service Center (NEPSC) in Jamaica, New York.  The SEPSC is a twelve story building of approximately 650,000 square feet, approximately 605,000 of which are occupiable, located at 2001 12 Avenue North, Birmingham, Alabama.  The NEPSC is a building of approximately 900,000 square feet, approximately 650,000 of which are occupiable, located at 155-10 Jamaica Avenue, Jamaica, New York. Contractor responsibilities include operation and maintenance of all air-conditioning/heating equipment; operation of the building computer system; daily operational tours and watches; service calls; preventive maintenance; emergency services, elevator maintenance and repair services; and other services required to ensure efficient operation of the buildings.  Transportation for pick-up of emergency and day-to-day parts and materials; an on-site stock of expendable supplies including but not limited to: grease, lubricating oil, air filters, plumbing parts, fuses, wiping rags and paper, ribbons, disks, computer boards, etc. for the Building Computer System is required.  Emergency call-back service for after hours is to be provided.  Qualified personnel provided by the contractor would include individuals such as: Project Manager, Chief Engineer, Quality Control Engineer, Environmental Control Center (ECC) Manager and ECC Operator, Engineers, Building Computer System Technician, and Pneumatic Control Specialist.  The firm’s employees essential to contract performance e.g., Shift-operating Engineers and the Building Computer System Operators would be required to be on-site 24 hours a day, 365 days each year at the facility.  Other employee’s would be required to be on-site Monday through Friday during the facility’s working hours and be able to expeditiously respond to service calls after working hours and on weekends and holidays. Contracts would include a base year plus as many as seven incentive option years.  

Interested small businesses should respond within 15 calendar days from the issuance date of this sources sought synopsis by submitting complete information about their capabilities.   Only written responses will be accepted and must clearly state the ability to provide the services e.g., information detailing their experience, past performance, duties, number and types of personnel in the Mechanical Maintenance of facilities similar to the size and complexities of the NEPSC or SEPSC.  Projects submitted for review should be limited to those being currently performed or completed within the previous 3 years.  No cost or pricing data is required or requested.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gather data required to determine if there are sufficient numbers of interested and qualified small businesses to justify setting aside these acquisitions exclusively for small business participation. This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited or received.  Acknowledgement of receipt will not be issued, nor will respondents be notified of the results of the evaluation of the data received.

If viable responses are not received, the Government has the discretion to determine no market interest exists and no subsequent RFP will be issued (on a utility-by-utility basis).

In addition, interested parties are required to provide information regarding experience and qualifications for operating utility systems for each of the systems of interest.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information for Joint Tactical Radio System ? Maritime/Fixed Station (JTRS-M/F) Cluster 3
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:   The objective of the Joint Tactical Radio System-Maritime/Fixed Station (JTRS-M/F) Cluster 3 program is to develop a Joint Tactical Rad= io System (JTRS) specifically for maritime and fixed station communication= requirements.  The purpose of the development effort is to create the n= ext generation Maritime and Fixed Station Communication system which shall provide growth capabilities through an open system architecture that enables technology insertion through evolutionary acquisition or preplanned product improvements (P3I).  JTRS-M/F shall be a multi-mode, multi-band, software definable radio system.  This will result in increased operational flexibility, enhance= d interoperability and reduced life cycle cost. JTRS-M/F will be capable of transmitting voice, video, and data while operating in frequency bands from 2 MHz to 2000 MHz.  In order to facilitate an orderly and cost-effective migration from legacy systems, the new JTRS-M/F shal= l maintain backward compatibility with selected legacy systems and provid= e a seamless technological transition path to support the next generation r= adio room.  The JTRS-M/F will be defined as a complete end-to-end communicat= ions system with a combination of hardware elements, supporting software infrastructure, and government furnished waveform applications.  This system will include all RF distribution and control equipment to support voice= , video, and data communications. The JTRS Program is a series of related but independent joint acquisiti= ons. The Army is the Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) for the joint activities executed by the JTRS Joint Program Office (JPO).  The JPO is responsibl= e for defining, developing, validating, and maintaining the Software Communication Architecture (SCA) and acquiring software waveform applications.  The JTRS-M/F (Cluster 3) Program Manager (Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, P= MW 179) is responsible for developing JTRS-M/F hardware (with a SCA-compliant operating environment) and porting waveforms obtained from the JTRS JPO waveform repository to field the JTRS-M/F as a final consolidated product (as defined in the JTRS-M/F System Specification) in support of the Fleet and other service fixed stations.  The key goals of the system are to ensure maximum scalability, modularity, and extensibility across all ship classes and fixed station= platforms. The anticipated release date for the official JTRS-M/F Cluster 3 Reques= t for Proposal (RFP) is in the summer 2003 timeframe with contract award anticipated 2nd Quarter of FY04.  It is estimated that the successful offerors will= have approximately thirty (30) months from contract award to provide Enginee= ring Developmental Models (EDM) for testing. In the process of developing the Cluster 3 Request for Proposal, the Na= vy is interested in examining the benefits and technical feasibility of developing a ?core? part of JTRS that is common to Clusters 3 and 4.  Cluster 4 is managed by the Air Force and is responsible for developing common JTRS hardware=  for 65 plus airborne platforms. This CBD announcement is to invite potential offerors to submit informa= tion that allows the government to evaluate the benefits, disadvantages, and= technical feasibility of developing a ?core? part of JTRS that is commo= n to Clusters 3 and 4 specifically and to all Clusters in general.  In generating a response, please address the following: =B7 What are potential common ?core? elements in the Clusters 3 (Mariti= me and Fixed Station) and Cluster 4 (Airborne) Joint Tactical Radio Systems?  = In making this determination, please consider system architecture, softwar= e infrastructure, and interchangeable hardware modules. =B7 What are the pros and cons of having these ?core? elements common b= etween the Clusters? =B7 How would the ?core? elements be developed/shared between the Clust= ers if the Cluster Program Offices remained distinct acquisition programs with potentially different industry teams?What are the pros and cons of a merger of Clus= ter 3 and Cluster 4 into a single Cluster Program Office? Responses to the RFI must be received by 1600 EST on 30 July 2003 in writing and delivered to both the Cluster 3 Procurement Contracting Officer (PC= O) and the Cluster 4 PCO. Mark Lopez, the Cluster 3 PCO, can be reached at: Commander, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, 4301 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92110-3127= , Attn: Mark Lopez, Code 02-33.

<SUBJECT>Y -- Construction Excellance - Ft. Pierce, Fl.
<DESC>WRITTEN EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FOR CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE FOR A NEW US COURTHOUSE, FT. PIERCE, FLORIDA  

WRITTEN EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FOR CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEW U. S. COURTHOUSE-FT. PIERCE, FLORIDA-GS-04P-03-EXC-0033. The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in public construction and is presently soliciting written expressions of interest and assurance of bonding capacity letters from qualified general contractors (GC) desiring to compete in the procurement process for the subject construction project. GSA intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract, utilizing successive target prices throughout the source selection process, to obtain the GC that offers the best overall value to the Government. The selected GC must demonstrate a commitment to construction excellence, proposing and maintaining a viable team organization and by adherence to the budgetary and time parameters for this project. The Government will utilize the Source Selection process in accordance with FAR Part 15.1, Best Value Continuum-FAR 15.101, and the Tradeoff process FAR 15.101-1 to select the GC that offers the best overall value. The site selected by the Government for the new United States Courthouse will be in the Central Business District of Ft. Pierce, Florida. The facility will include approximately 10,994 square meters (118,334 gross square feet) including 34 secure (inside) parking spaces and 73 on-grade parking spaces. The facility will be occupied by the Federal District Court,  Magistrate Court, Bankruptcy Court, District Clerk, Probation, Pretrial Services, Federal Defender, U.S. Attorneys Office, U.S. Marshals Service and the GSA.  The estimated total construction cost for the project is estimated to range between $25,000,000 and $26,500,000 with occupancy planned for 4th quarter of FY 2007. This procurement is advertised on an unrestricted basis with an approximate construction time of 545 calendar days. The North American Industry Classification System Code (s) (NAICS) for this procurement is 233220. The project will be in Metric Units of Measure. Utilizing FAR Part 15 and formal Source Selection procedures the GC will be competitively chosen. The Trade-Off process at FAR Part 15.101 allows award to other than the lowest priced proposal therefore, participants are urged to submit all proposals on their best terms possible as it is the Governments intent to make award without discussion in accordance with FAR 15.306 (3), Qualified offerors electing to participate in the name of newly formed partnerships, corporations, joint ventures and/or any other business entity or arrangement will be required to provide the government with legal proof of union upon submission. Under this procedure all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price (15. 101- a (2), thereby magnifying the importance of each offeror’s past and present stated ability to perform at a very high rate of technical competence and to submit all offers on the best terms possible. The procurement process is structured in 4 Stages as follows: STAGE I- In order to become eligible to compete for the award of this project qualified GCs must, within 30 days of the publication of this notice or no later than Close Of Business (COB) August 18, 2003, submit a one page letter of interest (include an address and point of contact that you wish the subsequent RFP package to be mailed) along with a statement letter from a bonding corporate surety, on their (the surety’s) letterhead, certifying their ability to obtain bonding capacity commensurate with the Estimated Construction Cost of at least $26,500,000 (Ceiling Price). Corporate sureties offered must appear on the list contained in the Department of Treasury Circular 570 “Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Reinsuring Companies or Acceptability of Individual Sureties” in accordance with FAR 28.202 and 203 (http://www.fms.treas.gov/c570/index.html). These two letters (letter of interest and bonding) must be submitted to the attention of Mr. R. Butler, Sr. Contracting Officer, General Services Administration, Property Development Division, 25th Floor, 401 West Peachtree Street, N.W-Atlanta, Georgia 30308–again, no later than COB August 18, 2003. In order to facilitate the milestones set for the project and the sequence of events relative to convening the formal Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) and other activities, offerors failing to submit the required Stage I data as required and in the timeframe stated will be ineligible to compete for this procurement. Late and/or incomplete submissions will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.214-7 and may render the offeror ineligible for further participation. Electronic submissions (faxes, e-mails, etc.) are not allowed during any stage of this process. STAGE-II-upon notification from GSA via Request for Proposal (RFP), offerors responding accordingly to Stage I will be required to submit, under separate cover, a target price (Cost and Profit separated) (IMPORTANT NOTE: In order to assist in maintaining the ceiling price and related budgets, Profit Percentages offered in Stage II must remain constant throughout the process and will not be subject to change throughout the various pricing stages for those selected. The amount of profit may change due to cost fluctuations but not the proposed percentage),  based on approximately 20%-35% completed concept documents (provided in the RFP) and technical evaluation factor data relative to this project as follows: (1) Past Experience (2) Past Performance , (3) Key Personnel Data  and (4) Project Management Plan-Technical Approach-Accounting System-Management of Extended Overhead Cost . Details and expanded versions relative to these factors will be contained in the subsequent RFP package. STAGE III-Following the receipt and scoring of the Stage II data and the evaluation/analysis of the price proposal, a shortlist of not more than three offerors will be selected and provided an agenda to compete in an evaluated  Interactive Project Participation Stage whereby they will be required to independently participate in a (5) Value Engineering Workshop(s) for at least 3 days with a maximum of three (3) attendees from each firm eligible to participate and to submit (6) Cost Saving Ideas and Concepts ,complete a (7) Constructability Review(s) and at least one (8) Independent Estimate during design development . The participants will be paid a pre-determined moderate stipend for these services. Upon completion and scoring of this stage the participants will again be asked to submit a target price (cost and profit) (same profit percentage as Stage 1) at approximately 50%-65% design completion along with a subcontracting plan (large businesses only) relative to the proposed price. The SSEB will then combine the target price along with the previous technical scores from each previous stage to select the participant that offers the best overall value to the Government by establishing a firm target price and a commitment to not exceeding the ceiling price of $26,500,000. Stage IV-(Award-CM Services) during this stage the selected GC will work in equanimity with the A-E of record, via a written contractual agreement, not to exceed the pre-determined amount (amount included in RFP) to be paid following contract award, to finalize the design to 100% completion within the committed ceiling price. Upon design completion the Government will negotiate with the selected contractor to establish a Firm Fixed Priced contract noting that the submitted profit percentage remained unchanged. Should negotiations between the final selected GC and the Government reach an impasse the Government, in accordance with FAR 15.405 (d), will refer the matter to a level above the Contracting Officer and request permission to undertake negotiations with the next highest ranked previously short-listed offeror. Award will be based on availability of funds in accordance with FAR 52.232-14. Prior to the Interactive Participation Stage III and submission of price proposals a Pre-Proposal Conference and a Socio-Economic Program Meeting (networking session) will be scheduled with offerors to entertain inquiries concerning the scope of work and related issues. The networking session allows for the marketing and exchange of information with small businesses with potential prime contractors to facilitate marketing opportunities, business ventures and employment opportunities. Prior to award of this contract to a large business a subcontracting plan must be negotiated in accordance with FAR Part 19 which demonstrates a proactive effort to achieve the following minimum small business goals for all subcontracted work: Total Small Businesses (40%), Small Disadvantaged Businesses (8%), Small Women-Owned Businesses (5%), Service-Disabled Veteran (3%) and HubZone (2.5%). All submittals must clearly indicate the solicitation number (GS-04P-03-EXC-0033) on the face of the envelope.  Late submittals will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.215-10.

The Targets Management Office (TMO) is developing a NGATS to replace existing target systems on live fire ranges.  The NGATS will be made up of families of targetry components that are interchangeable and provide the required performance at a low life cycl e cost.  The information will be used to establish realistic NGATS life cycle costs for budgeting purposes. As life cycle cost is a significant factor in the NGATS program, the TMO is seeking life cycle information, specifically Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR), for each end item and its Line Replaceable Units (LRUs).  The end ite ms for which information is being sought include Stationary Infantry Targets (SITs), Stationary Armor Targets (SATs), Moving Infantry Targets (MITs), and Moving Armor Targets (MATs).  MTBF and MTTR information should be expressed in hours.  Request product  manufacturers provide estimates of MTBFs and MTTRs for equipment in the field.  This information will be used to establish realistic NGATS life cycle cost estimates for budgeting purposes.  It is highly desired that the MTBF and MTTR information be submit ted with unlimited rights or as a minimum Government use rights. The information provided as a result of this RFI is intended solely for planning purposes and does not constitute an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. All responses should be forwarded to Mr. James E. Fletcher electronically at james.fletcher@redstone.army.mil or via datafax at (256) 955-0261, not later than 30 Jul 03.

<CONTACT>Maia Browning Training Manager 9286387985     ;
<DESC>Scope of Work Vendor will provide one or more instructors who are qualified to deliver the Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) module of the "National Park Service (NPS) Fundamentals III: Retirement Planning" course.  The course will be presented at least five times in fiscal year 2004 (October 1, 2003 - September 30, 2004), one iteration per day.  Course dates may be negotiated once the contract is awarded, but in general will occur every two months.  Additional presentations may be scheduled depending upon demand.  All courses are televised from the Fish & Wildlife Service's National Conservation Training Center located in Shepherdstown, West Virginia. Program Description NPS Fundamentals is a five-part course of study that encompasses a broad understanding of the mission and goals of the National Park Service.  It is designed to create a workforce that is committed to achieving the NPS mission.  Specifically, NPS Fundamentals focuses on the Universal Competencies:  Mission Comprehension, Agency Orientation, Resource Stewardship, NPS Operations, Fundamental Values, Communication Skills, Problem-solving Skills, and Individual Development and Planning.  The NPS Training Manager for Universal Competencies provides program oversight.  This position is duty-stationed at the Albright Training Center, Grand Canyon, Arizona. The "Retirement Planning" module is part of the "Individual Development and Planning" competency.  This training consists of two modules; both entitled "Retirement Planning".  Employees take the first module online; they must complete the online module before participating in the second module, which is delivered via interactive television using the NPS TEL system.  There are currently 117 NPS sites with TEL installations; more may be added.  Attendance per TEL course is estimated at 100 participants but varies widely. Tasks 1)	Vendor will provide studio instructor(s) for the TEL NPS module on Retirement Planning.  Instructor(s) must have professional expertise in and knowledge of the Civil Service (CSRS) and Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS), and all variations thereof (e.g., 6(C) retirement).  Instructor(s) must have professional expertise of financial planning.  Financial planning experts must be thoroughly familiar with investment options available in all Federal retirement systems, trends in the market, and in the national and global economy in general.  Vendor will not provide specific investment advice such as 'invest in _______' (a specific company name), but will provide general principles of investing with a focus on taking advantage of the investment options of the Federal retirement system.  Instructor(s) must be able to present compelling arguments to new employees regarding the urgency of retirement planning, using specific examples. 2)	Vendor will schedule additional, pre-course time to meet with the production manager on-site and/or to meet with NPS staff as necessary.  At a minimum, the vendor will meet with the production manager before the first course is presented, either on the day of the presentation or on a day mutually agreed upon prior to the course.  The purpose of the meeting will be to review materials and procedures at the facility, and to rehearse the presentation.  Additional meetings and/or phone consultations may be called by the Training Manager as necessary. 3)	Vendor will review the online training module at the outset of the contract, and review periodically as needed to ensure a strong, clear linkage between the online module and the TEL module.  As an outcome of the review, the vendor is expected to provide current and accurate information to ensure that online and TEL module materials are up-to-date.  Vendor will inform the Training Manager of changes as they occur in retirement policy or practices and provide supporting materials to consider for inclusion in one or both modules. 4)	Vendor will work from the existing TEL materials.  Changes to the content of the presentation should occur only when information becomes outdated.  Vendor is expected to recommend changes to delivery techniques and/or graphics and other materials based on their professional experience.  All changes must be approved in advance by the Training Manager prior to implementation. Required Skills and Abilities Vendor must provide instructors who are highly effective and have extensive experience in using distance learning techniques, specifically in interactive television broadcasts.  Instructors must not only deliver the material clearly and effectively, but be able to engage participants in discussion.  Vendor must have experience in covering program content in general.
