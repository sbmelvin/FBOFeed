<DESC>Notice of Intent to issue single source award to Hedgerow Farms for the purchase San Joaquin Variety (or genotype) of creeping wildrye seed.   In order to establish creeping wild rye on the acreage affected by the fire, 2015 pounds of seed will need to be purchased.  This seed will be planted on approximately 310 acres of the refuge (6.5lbs/acre).   It is critical that only the San Joaquin Variety (or genotype) of creeping wildrye is purchased and planted during this project, as it is cultivated from a seed source found on the San Joaquin River NWR.  This variety is native to the project area and locally adapted to site conditions.  No other varieties or genotypes will be accepted.  There are very few nurseries in California that cultivate and sell large quantities of this seed.  The San Joaquin Variety is currently only available at Hedgerow Farms in Winters, California.  Due to these constraints, purchasing seed from a single dealer may be the only option available. PLACE/DELIVERY AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  San Joaquin NWR, 3818 Dairy Rd., Vernalis, CA, 95385 Seed will be delivered after purchase to the San Joaquin NWR in late summer, soon after it is harvested.  A more precise time is unavailable as the timing of seed harvest is effected climatic conditions.  Seed will be planted in fall 2005 after the first rains of the season.   INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE:  All seed will be inspected and approved by the wildlife biologist overseeing the project.  Percent live seed (P.L.S.), documented through a seed analysis, will be no less than 65%. TECHNICAL COORDINATOR:  Ken Griggs, Wildlife Biologist San Luis NWRC P.O.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced today that it is seeking to identify qualified industry consultants to assist 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 121 applicants in the certification process.  Consultants who meet the minimum qualifications can enter into an agreement with the FAA that would allow them to be listed by the FAA as qualified part 121 Certification Consultants. The part 121 certification process is complex and the success of the process turns on the quality of the application.  Although the FAA is committed to providing certification services, a reduced budget and an increase in attrition leaves fewer resources available to assist new entrants in the certification process.  As a result, part 121 certifications are often delayed or in some cases fail because of the unpreparedness of the applicant.  In an effort to address this new entrant need, the FAA will develop and maintain a list of qualified part 121 Certification Consultants to assist in the certification process.  This process will benefit the general public by helping expedite new entrant applications.  1.	Eligibility Requirements: To be identified as an FAA-qualified Certification Consultant, a consultant must meet the following qualifications:  a)	At least two years experience working with the part 121 certification process.  b)	Successful completion of FAA Course 25036, System Safety/ATOS Seminar or successful completion of both FAA Courses 22006, System Safety & 21429, Air Transportation Oversight System (ATOS), or equivalent.    c)	Completion of AFS-900 Certification Process Seminar. d)	Ability to apply Flight Standards System Safety processes, including Risk     Management to air carrier manual design. e)	Have understanding of each step of the Flight Standards Certification Process Document (CPD), as revised, to include the individual appendices.     f)	Have operations and airworthiness personnel qualified through training, experience, and expertise in part 121 air carrier operations, or equivalent experience.   g)	Automation capabilities commensurate with the guidance contained in the CPD as revised. h)	A documented method for air carrier process and manual development and a complete understanding of air carrier systems, processes, and manual design. 2. Required Documentation:  A Certification Consultant must submit a formal letter of request plus the following documents to the address listed below: a.	Statement substantiating that the Certification Consultant meets the eligibility requirements specified in this notice. b.	 Supplemental statement including the names, signatures, and titles of those persons who will perform the authorized functions, and substantiating that they meet the eligibility requirements.  c.	Written procedures for air carrier process and manual development. d.	 A statement demonstrating complete understanding of process engineering and manual design. e.

A Certification Consultant must appear in person before a representative of the Flight Standards Certification and Surveillance Division, AFS-900, for an interview. 3. How to Apply:  A Certification Consultant must submit all required documents for consideration before being identified as an FAA-qualified certification consultant to the address listed below: FAA, Flight Standards Certification and Surveillance Division  Attn:  ATOS CMO / Certification Consultant Agreements 45005 Aviation Drive, Suite 131  Dulles, VA   20166 4.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education's (ED) Office of the Chief Information Office (OCIO) requires continuous access to educational programming from both public and private cable television channels.  These cable television channels provide a number of items of interest to ED, including time-sensitive information pertinent to ED's mission; mission-related programs, policy, and strategy issues supported by the executive and program staffs; access to specialized educational programming; and direct satellite linkage for viewing the monthly "Satellite Town Meetings" conducted by the Secretary of ED, as well as other education-related video teleconferences distributed by satellite.  ED has been providing cable television capability to its headquarters buildings since April 1992.  As a result of this positive experience, demand for this service has grown throughout ED.  More recently, there has been a need for a private departmental local origination channel to permit the viewing of video teleconferences, meetings, and videotaped programming throughout ED.

The purposes of this acquisition are:  1) to acquire the continuation of cable television services similar to those currently being provided at 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, and the other ED buildings in Washington, DC (WDC) and the National Capital Region (NCR); and 2) to enhance the services to include a local origination capability available on a private cable channel.  This acquisition is for a one-year base period and four option years.

Cable services shall be provided to various Department buildings in the Washington, D.C. area, including: Federal Office Building 6 (FB6), located at 400 Maryland Avenue, SW.  The current ED locations to receive cable television services include:  FB6, Regional Office Building 3 (ROB3), located at 700 D Street, SW; Union Center Plaza (UCP), located at 830 First Street, NE; Potomac Center Plaza (PCP), located at 550 12th Street, SW; Capitol Place (CP), located at 555 New Jersey Avenue; and the Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) building at 1990 K Street, NW.  It is recognized that some channels may not be available at some of the locations due to technical constraints.

Anticipated release date of the RFQ is 6/6/2005.  Anticipated response date is 7/5/2005.  Award will be made to the proposal that is determined to represent the lowest cost while technically acceptable.

<CONTACT>Noah Oliver,937.255-2379
<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 027 (07 MAR 05) - Draft SRD An updated version of the draft Systems Requirement Document (SRD), Rev 3, dated 7 March 2005 is available for review and comment.  Please note this document falls under "DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of Defense and DOD Contractors only to protect technical or operational data..."  To receive a copy of the SRD, please send an email request to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code (Contractors only). It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attention Capt Thompson, by COB 18 March 2005.  For those prime offerors that request a "face-to-face"  discussion of the draft SRD, we encourage you to contact Capt Thompson at 937- 255-4600 to make the arrangements.  We plan to hold these sessions 29 March through 1 April at Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK, Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) - SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11 Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and 3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent, understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0 requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (09 DEC 04) - Archived solicitation/synopsis  information See below attached file for archived PIXS soliciation synopsis information  (initial through Amendment 20).

<DESC>This is a pre-award notice.  The National Park Service intends to award two concession contracts, one to Johnny¿s East River Lodge and the second to the Northern Lights Haven, both within Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve in the Dry Bay area for the period June 1, 2005 through December 31, 2014. The services listed in both contracts are overnight accommodations and food service for the public within Glacier Bay National Preserve, and retail sales (gift items and sundry sales) on the land assignment; recreational equipment rental on the land assignment; ground transportation in the Preserve; guided hikes in the Preserve and along the outer coast north of Lituya Bay; guided motorized and non-motorized boat trips on freshwater streams in the Preserve; guided sport fishing in the Preserve and along the outer coast north of Lituya Bay; and guided non-motorized boat trips on Alsek Lake.   These two contracts will be awarded pursuant to section 1307 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, 16 USC 3197 and 36 CFR 13.80-13.82.  Generally, historical operators have a right to continue to provide the same kind and scope of service that they were legally engaged in providing prior to January 1, 1979 pursuant to 36 CFR 13.82(a).  NPS has determined that these two companies are historical operators and consequently are eligible to be awarded a concession contract non-competitively. Any questions may be directed to the Point of Contact above.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC), Panama City, Florida, intends to solicit Innovative Professional Solutions (IPS), 8317 Front Beach Road, Suite 17D2, Panama City, Florida 32407, on a sole-source basis for Digital Signal Processing design support for the Magneto Inductive (MI) technology program.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  IPS has been providing uninterrupted support to the MI program since February 2003.  IPS personnel have a unique combination of:  (a) technical knowledge of the MI program and technology, gained from prior support of the program; (b) many years of experience providing programmatic, acquisition, safety and technical support to similar programs, particularly in the area of firing devices, detonators and mine development, and; (c) expertise in the areas of acquisition, program management, and engineering required to perform the functions required. Because of this extens! ive knowledge base, it is estimated that use of any other contractor would increase the cost to obtain the required support by not less than 50 percent.  The period of performance will be for approximately nine (9) months from date of award.  Delivery will be the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  A firm-fixed-price order is anticipated.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI)  intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with Capital Technology Information Systems, Inc. (CTIS)  One Research Court, Suite 200, Rockville, MD 20850.  The anticipated award to CTIS will provide maintenance and ancillary software development for the Heart Institute’s Clinical Data System (CDS). The critical components of the award include design and development enhancements to the CDS, system documentation, software testing and training, comprehensive project planning and management in addition to performing miscellaneous tasks in support of total system functionality.  
It is imperative that the knowledge base established during the system’s development with CTIS be maintained.  The advancement and implementation of the system modules are nearly complete.  As a part of the current contract, Core Technology licenses for their proprietary Clinical Oncology Information System and Case Report Form Designer were procured.  These systems were designed and developed by CTIS.  The implementation of additional functionality under the current award has been greatly enhanced by the use of these platforms.  The combined knowledge of the systems used as well as the staff expertise in clinical trials processes and regulations have resulted in a very efficient and effective monitoring of the evolution of this new system.  Acceptance and usage by intramural physicians, researchers and staff is just beginning.  As NIH personnel are learning to use and depend on the CDS for day to day activities, it is critical that disruptions are minimal.  A change in the contractor and the associated learning curve for a new contractor poses the unacceptable risk that new users will abandon the CDS after early, unsatisfactory usage attempts.
This action is under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306-302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 30 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to award a sole source contract to Spring Valley Laboratories, Inc for a one-year period for Maintenance and Technical Manipulation of Rabbits at NIH, Bethesda, MD. Care of rabbits will be in accordance with current animal welfare regulations and policies.  Authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set for in FAR 6.302-1. NIAID has been conducting a long-term breeding and immunization experiment, for several years to study the development of autoimmunity in rabbit models of the human autoimmune disease Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).  The colony of genetically defined pedigreed rabbits, animals being used in this experiment, and the inbred rabbits being maintained are important resources for current and future NHGRI rabbit genome sequencing.  The stress of moving these animals would seriously negate several years of experimental studies now in progress and would impact on the final results of the study. For this reason, Spring Valley Laboratories, Inc has been identified as the only responsible source for this requirement.  If you have any questions or comments please respond in writing to Carolyn Wilder at cwilder@niaid.nih.gov on or before June 27, 2005 at 2:00 pm EDT. See Number Note 22.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Boulder, Colorado proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the University of California to analyze and publish Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS) data from measurements made at Chebogue Point, Nova Scotia during the NOAA NEAQAS-ITCT 2K4 research program in July-August 2004.   These surface measurements were complementary to the airborne and ship board measurements made on the NOAA WP-3D aircraft and R/V Ron Brown.  It is the government’s belief that the skills of the researcher’s engaged by the University of California at Berkeley uniquely qualify them for this work because the data to be analyzed was collected by their group using a Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer. Therefore, they have familiarity with the data and the specialized instrument used to collect the data.  The interpretation of data collected using this instrument requires specialized knowledge of the ion chemistry used in the instrument.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Anticipated award:  date May 31, 2005.  NAICS:  541690.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Climate Monitoring & Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Droplet Measurement Technologies, Inc. of Boulder, CO for a Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) counter.  Knowledge of the influence of particles on climate requires measurements of the properties of those particles that nucleate cloud droplets, which are called cloud condensation nuclei (CCN).  CMDL will measure CCN concentrations at selected ground stations.  The CCN counter performance specifications required are as follows:  1) continuous flow; 2) single-supersaturation operation, adjustable in the range of 0.1 to 1.0%; 3) computer control of temperature and flowrates; 4) automatic wetting of sample chamber; 5) RS-232C serial connection for interfacing with the data acquisition system; and 6) 1-second data update.  Based on market research, it is the government’s belief that no other known source is available that can offer a commercial CCN counter that meets all the required specifications.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100K).  This notice is for information purposes only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Otelia Newsome, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-3164
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   EPA intends to award a sole source procurement on or about May 31, 2005 to Scott Smith/Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1):--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The U.S. EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Exposure Research Laboratory has a need for  technical support to conduct ship-board collection of aggregate ballast samples from coast-wise and intercontinental ship traffic. This action provides for the collection of aggregate (water  and/or sediment) ballast samples taken from ship traffic off the coast of Washington State. The work encompassed by this task will directly support the 2005-2006 Region 10/ORD Regional Applied Research Effort (RARE) project entitled, "Regional transport and secondary spread of invasive species  across Pacific estuaries". The task shall support project phase #2: Targeted screening for NIS in ballast water. The task shall also support project phase #1: Community-wide comparison of invasion pathways across Pacific estuaries. The contractor shall conduct repeated sampling of commercial  ships' ballast tanks to support targeted screening for invasive species of concern. This shall involve acquiring permission to board ships and access the ships' ballast tanks.  For coast-wise sampling, depending on the availability of accessible ships, sampling may be restricted to one or several  "repeater" ships that traffic the west coast along assigned routes on a regular schedule.  Sampling of non-repeater and repeater ships shall be restricted to ships routed between ports in Oregon and California, but particularly from San Francisco Bay, and ports located in Washington State (ie.  Puget Sound, Columbia River). Ballast sampling shall be completed during the period after which ballast tanks have been filled and before tanks have been exchanged en route to the receiving ports. Therefore, sampling may be performed when a ship is in port close to departure, during the ship's  journey between ports, or before a ship has dropped ballast prior to completion of a route. The majority of coast-wise ship sampling shall focus on ships originating from San Francisco Bay, however additional sampling of ballast in ships originating from other California ports and ports in Oregon  shall also be included, since it would enable further evaluation of cross-fertilization rates between port localities.  The contractor shall sample as many intercontinental ships as is feasible within the confines of cost and scheduling.   For sampling intercontinental ship traffic, depending on  the availability of accessible ships, sampling may be restricted to ships with which the contractor has prior arrangements to perform ship-board sampling.  Sampling of multiple ships, or multiple sampling of a single repeater ship, shall correspond to a timeline structured around standard  commercial shipping calendars.  However, sampling shall also reflect biological cycles of importance, for example, the seasonality of reproductive cycles of species of concern to enable comparisons of ballast content before, during, and after peak reproduction events.  All ballast samples shall be  taken following a standard protocol for zooplankton collection, and stored in ethanol in a non-breakable and re-sealable container. All ballast samples shall be shipped to the US EPA.  Shipping of samples shall be expedited (e.g. next-day delivery) and must follow standard requirements for  transport of hazardous chemicals.  No Request for Quotation is available and this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of this notice to Otelia Newsome at the  above address for consideration by the Agency.  Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is  feasible.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive  procurement.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the government, a purchase order will be placed with Scott Smith/Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. See Numbered Note(s): 22.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with the National Minority Aids Council,  Washington, DC.

Purpose:
The United States Conference on AIDS is a nationally recognized conference focused on the critical public health issues associated with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. .  The mission of the U.S. Conference on AIDS (USCA) is to increase the strength and diversity of the community-based response to the AIDS epidemic through education, training, new partnerships, collaborations and networking.  Each year, the USCA attracts more than 3,000 conferees representing community-based AIDS service organizations, advocates, people living with AIDS, government officials, and non-governmental agencies interested in HIV/AIDS.
USCA is sponsored by the National Minority AIDS Council (NMAC).  NMAC was established in 1987 to promote and mobilize leadership within communities of color to combat HIV/AIDS.  NMAC works to strengthen the capacity and infrastructure of minority community-based organizations and to promote sound, national HIV/AIDS policies that are responsive to the unique needs of these communities.
The National Minority AIDS Council (NMAC) is the only national organization devoted exclusively to combat HIV/AIDS in communities of color.  NMAC sponsors the United States Conference on AIDS, the premier national conference on AIDS, to develop leadership in minority communities to address the broad spectrum of issues related to HIV/AIDS transmission, prevention, primary care and treatment, and research.  NMAC increases the strength and diversity of community-based responses to the AIDS epidemic through education, training, new partnerships, collaboration and networking opportunities provided at USCA.
NMAC maintains a consistently strong base of USCA conferees, including community planning members, community and faith-based organizations, health departments, federal, State and local government officials, and research institutions.  In 2004, USCA attracted 3,000+ diverse conferees, from all regions of the country, who actively participated as advocates, expert presenters and participants.  
NMAC convenes USCA with the participation of nationally recognized experts for conference program tracks that include: care and primary care, executive director leadership, fundraising and finance, international issues, nutrition, prevention, public policy, special issues, treatment and research.  USCA strengthens the capacity of community-based organizations that serve minority communities through the vibrant exchange of information and resources presented in institutes, seminars, plenary sessions, and the more than 200 workshops, roundtables, and poster presentations on varied HIV/AID issues.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), NIH Mouse Imaging Facility (MIF) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Xenogen, 5 Cedar Brook Dr, Cranbury, New Jersey 08512 for a Spectral Instruments TE Cooled Camera upgrade for its existing Xenogen IVIS imaging system. The Mouse Imaging Facility is a shared resource that provides state-of-the-art facilities for research in development and application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), X-ray computed tomography, bioluminescence, ultrasound and other animal imaging techniques.  The facility resources are accessible to all investigators at NIH.  Further, the MIF provides technical and material support for research activities conducted within the In Vivo NMR Research Center.  The SI TE cooled camera has an expected vacuum life of >2.5 years and there is no cryotiger unit that would require routine maintenance.  This upgrade means less potential for instrument down time due to equipment failures and a quieter working environment as the cryotiger is a noisy device.    The SI TE cooled camera is a 1 inch back thinned camera, back illuminated CCD cooled to -90C. Although the camera component is made by Spectral Instruments, the IVIS imaging system is manufactured and maintained by Xenogen.  Xenogen will not permit third party equipment modifications and the warranty and service plan would not be supported by Xenogen.  Therefore, it is imperative that the camera be purchased and installed through Xenogen to maintain service to this important piece of equipment.  Xenogen is the only known source to the NINDS researcher that can provide the aforementioned equipment.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  The Government’s intent is to upgrade one of its instruments, and capability statements offering a new instrument or that will not maintain the warranty and service plan of its Government owned Xenogen IVIS Imaging System will not be considered.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NINDS researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on May 23, 2005.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 334516; Size Standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Surface & Microanalysis Science Division, has a requirement for a Walk-Through Trace Detection Portal to be used by NIST to investigate the measurement capabilities of walk through portal based trace explosives/narcotics detectors.

As part of the NIST research program, new standard reference materials and procedures for calibration and evaluation of portal systems will be developed. NIST currently has a prototype portal system on loan from the transportation security administration (TSA) that utilizes a pulsed air jet system for liberation of explosive/narcotic particles followed by entrainment of those particles in a downward directed flow of air with collection onto a first stage pre-concentration system.  To facilitate development of standards for both types of portal systems, the system required by NIST must rely on the human-induced thermal convective air flows for sampling and collection. 

Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION.

This requirement is being procured using simplified acquisition procedures under the authority of FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items via full & open competition.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), specifications, any subsequent amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number 
SB1341-05-Q-0620.

The RFQ is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about May 19, 2005, and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.

Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the RFQ in order to be considered for award of any resultant purchase order.   No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to Carol.Wood@NIST.Gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

We plan to hold these sessions 29 March  through 1 April at Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

<CONTACT>Noah Oliver,937.255-2379
<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.

Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 030 (28 MAR 05) – Capabilities Development Document (CDD)  A current version of the Personnel Recovery Vehicle CDD is available for  industry review and comment.  Please note this documents falls  under “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of  Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractor’s only to protect technical or operational  data…”  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only).   It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.

<DESC>REGION 8  START III SOLICITATION PR-HQ-05-10166 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR PR-HQ-05-10166 - START3, REGION 8 QUESTION #1: Section L.22 specifies that 4 contractor plans need to be submitted (Quality Management Plan, Conflict of Interest Plan, Corporate Health and Safety Plan, Subcontracting Plan) and Section L.10 lists 6 contractor plans to be submitted (the plans listed in L.22 plus Professional Employee Compensation Plan and Standard Emergency Response/Counter Terrorism Procedures).  Please confirm that the six plans identified in L.10 are required to be submitted with the proposal. ANSWER #1: Yes, all six plans need to be submitted with the proposal. QUESTION #2: Attachment 12 page 12-3.  The 150-page limitation "does NOT include resumes, scenarios, QAPP, and site specific health and safety plans". Please confirm that the 150-page limit also does not include the six plans listed in L.10.  Also, please confirm that the 150-page limitation is 150 pages of text printed (double-sided) on 75 pages of paper. ANSWER #2: Attachment 12 page 12-3 states ?this page limitation does NOT include resumes, scenarios which may be presented orally, QAPP, and site specific health and safety plans required for scenarios?.   All other plans are included in the 150 pages. The 150 pages are pages, not sheets.  You may submit up to 75 sheets of paper.  It would be to your advantage to double side print them. QUESTION #3: Section L.22, Additional requirements for COI Plan.  The databases referenced provide compliance history information at facilities.  It is not clear how the information available from the databases (toxic chemical releases, water discharge permit compliance, hazardous waste handling processes, air emission estimates, compliance inspections) relates to organizational conflict of interest for START work.  The request to "please discuss any activities that are identified on databases...for each of the task areas described in the PWS" is not clear.  Please clarify EPA's expectations for incorporating compliance history data into Conflict of Interest Plans. ANSWER #3: EPA is seeking to determine the compliance history of your company to determine whether or not your company would have a conflict of interest in assisting EPA document pollution from other companies.  The RFP, amendments and other information related to this procurement will be posted on EPA's Office of Acquisition Management website, at the following URL: http://www.epa.gov/oam/index.htm.  At the above web page, scroll down to "Business Opportunities with EPA" and select the "Solicitations and Amendments" link.  Then select " Superfund/RCRA Regional Procurement Operations Division." Under the Solicitation and Amendments heading select "Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team III, Region 8." All information related to this procurement will be available at this link through the date of award.   Award will be made on a best value basis with technical being of greater importance than cost/price. The North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) code 562910 applies.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  THIS IS A TOPICAL BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) IN SUPPORT OF AN AT SEA DEMONSTRATION TO REFINE CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS (CON-OPS) AND REQUIREMENTS FOR AN EXPENDABLE SUBMARINE COMMUNICATIONS BUOY This project, identified as the Expendable  Communications Buoy (ECB), is to   provide submarine communications while at depth via a satellite constellation.   The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport (NUWCDIVNPT) seeks technology needed to enable satisfaction of the functional and performance requirements established for the ECB. Proposals shall describe basic design and construction of an ECB and interface unit that will meet and operate in a typical submarine operating environment as describe below. Include performance and test objectives described herein.  We anticipate that this will  include  (6) prototype buoys for communications performance and launch test evaluation and an additional (2) ECBs for ship board in-water testing that can be completed no later than ten (10) months after contract award.  The proposal will address two configurations of the ECB.  The first (Phase I) configuration of the ECB needs to demonstrate a capability of performing one- way submarine communications over a satellite system to shore.  The second (Phase II) configuration of the ECB shall demonstrate a two way communications link to the submarine via an expendable fiber optic pack.  The submarine operating environment identified below is pertinent to both the Phase I and Phase II configurations except where noted.  Deployment demonstrated from the existing 3" diameter submarine signal ejector tube.  It is desirable that this be done while transiting at up to 6 knots while submerged.    Demonstrated  satellite communications on the surface in up to sea state 5 conditions is desirable.  The ECB upon deployment will be positively buoyant and acoustically benign.  The ECB shall be capable of being programmed while inside the submarine signal ejector tube via a fiber optic link and controller.  The offereror will develop the user interface and the controller will accept and program the buoy with message formats to be furnished by the government once the contract has been awarded.   The buoy shall accept and recycle for verification a data stream consisting of performance parameters and message.  The message will be stored in a non-volatile solid state device of at least 512 Kilobytes.  Demonstrate a programming capability of the ECB through a program operating in the MS Windows environment  including a delay to transmit feature is desirable. The government can provide a software program that the offeror may use as guidance for development of the ECB programming and operating software.  The interface unit will connect to the ships LAN via an Ethernet connection to provide for programming the ECB from the submarine radio and control rooms.  The ECB will have a self contained power source that is submarine safe.   The use of non-pyrotechnic devices in the design of the ECB for functional requirements is a goal of this demonstration.  At the end of the mission all material shall not be visible at the surface.  The ECB  internal circuitry that controls timing, activation, deployment, communications, message memory and scuttling shall be contained within the buoy housing.  Typical submarine temperature ranges include long term (more than 7 days) storage temperature of -20º to 55º C.   Short term (less than 7 days) storage temperature ranges of -5º to 40º C.   Vibration per MIL-STD-167 type 1 up to 33 Hz is operationally typical in the submarine environment.  Launch induced mechanical shock loading characterize by a pulse of 110 g 1/2 sine wave of eleven milliseconds duration is common.  Additionally the ECB shall not suffer damage when subjected to a 200 pound load on a 32 inch moment arm for ten seconds.  As an engineering goal the Phase I ECB will be subject to hydrostatic pressures up to 1050 psi.  The Phase II ECB will be subject to hydrostatic pressures up to 250 psi.  The ECB shall not contain materials that are considered hazardous within a submarine environment including: 
Asbestos and asbestos compounds
Beryllium and beryllium compounds
Cadmium
Carcinogens
Chlorofluorcarbons
Flammable or combustible materials
Fragile or brittle materials
Lead or lead components
Lithium and lithium compounds
Magnesium or magnesium alloys
Mercury or its compounds or amalgams
Phenols or phenolic compounds
Polychlorinated biphenyls
Polyvinyl chloride
Zinc or zinc alloys

Each ECB shall be marked with Contract and Manufactures CAGE as well as Part number, serial number, Power source expiration date, and any pertinent cautions related to handling or stowage.  The ECB shall be manufactured using entirely new material and to contractor workmanship standards.   Predicated reliability of the ECB shall be addressed.  The government will supply the winning contractor with   L band modems (including op licensing), L band patch antennas if needed.  Details of this GFM can be furnished upon request.  The government reserves the right to perform laboratory testing, prior to ship board in-water testing, to verify that the supplied buoys meet or exceed the performance requirements of this solicitation.  The Phase II ECB will utilize a fiber optic tether that connects the submarine to the ECB.  This tether will be a minimum of 4 kilometers in length.   The Phase II design will incorporated all features for deploying the fiber within the ECB housing.   The Phase II ECB communications link goal is to demonstrate at speeds of 6 knots  a surface communications time of 20 minutes at a 50% duty cycle.  The Phase II ECB needs to ascend to the surface at a minimum of 2 ft per second.  If the phase II approach incorporates a separate lifting body the design shall preclude the possibility of the lifting body and fiber optic tether being drawn into the submarine propeller.  SUBMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS • Proposals are desired addressing technical approaches to the ECB requirements. Proposals may be submitted at anytime during this period.

<DESC>United States Postal Service
Request for Information
U.S. Postal Service Retail Outlets in Commercial Retail Stores

1.  Introduction
 
The United States Postal Service® is exploring the concept of expanding customer access to mailing services by placing U.S. Postal Service retail outlets in large commercial retail venues.  This request for information attempts to determine (1) the level of interest among national or regional retail chains in hosting U.S. Postal Service-operated retail outlets within selected stores; and (2) the retailers’ expectation for a mutually beneficial business arrangement.  Any other ideas to further and promote the concept beyond the description provided below are highly welcome.  

2.  Description
 
The U.S. Postal Service outlets would be staffed and operated entirely by postal employees.  Customers would be able to obtain most of the products and services available at any post office, including postage stamps, Express Mail, Priority Mail, First Class Mail, Parcel Post, Delivery Confirmation, and Certified Mail.   All prices will be the same as those charged at post offices.

The U.S. Postal Service outlets would maintain hours of operation appropriate for the host store’s environment and customer base, including counter service on weekends and in the evenings.  

Host retailers will be asked to work jointly with the U.S. Postal Service to select participating host stores as well as choosing optimum in-store placement.  The outlets are expected to be between 450 square feet and 650 square feet.  Host retailers will also be expected to work with the USPS to co-market and co-promote availability at retail locations.

The U.S. Postal Service is especially interested in speaking with potential partners that operate a chain or chains in multiple markets or regions.  Stores should be open seven days per week, and at least 14 hours each day.  Large, high-customer traffic supermarket locations are preferred, especially those serving rapidly growing communities.  Host stores should have customer traffic of at least 18,000 customers per week.

3.  Mutual Responsibilities of the U.S. Postal Service and Host Retailer

The U.S. Postal Service would:

  a.  Develop and build U.S. Postal Service outlet within the selected location;  
  b.  Provide and install all necessary fixtures, equipment, and signage;
  c.  Provide U.S. Postal Service employees to work inside retail store;
  d.  Perform on-site hardware maintenance and service and providing consumable items. 
  e.  Pay telecommunications costs associated with the outlet’s operation.
 
The Host Retailer would:

  f.  Provide customer access to the USPS retail store during all store operating hours;
  g.  Provide a secure, well-lighted environment for the retail store; 
  h.  Provide electrical and phone connections as agreed to by both parties; and
  i.  Provide site repair should the USPS retail store be removed by mutual agreement.
  j.  Provide a clear and convenient path for the removal of outgoing mail.
 		
4.  Responding to this Request for Information 

Retailers interested in discussing this opportunity are asked to provide the following information:

  a.  A description of your company management structure, operating divisions, and ownership (an annual report, 10K or equivalent is sufficient for this purpose).
  b.  A description of your company’s regional and market coverage including average foot traffic.
  c.  An estimate of the number of your company’s stores that would have adequate space available for a U.S. Postal Service retail outlet based on the description provided earlier.  
  d.  A description of your expectations for a mutually beneficial business arrangement with the U.S. Postal Service.
Your response to this request should not exceed ten (10) pages, not including annual reports or other supporting materials.  Responses should include name, title, business phone, fax, e-mail and mailing address for all future correspondence.  All information will be kept strictly confidential.

5.  Decision Process

The U.S. Postal Service’s decision to pursue discussions with respondents to this request for information will be based upon a judgment of those companies that offer the best business opportunity.  The U.S. Postal Service may engage in discussions with multiple respondents.  

All companies will receive written acknowledgement of their response to this request for information.  However, by submitting a response to this request for information, companies agree that the U.S. Postal Service will not provide its rationale for the selection or non-selection of companies for further discussion.  Decisions will be based upon all information provided by respondents to this request.  

This request for information does not reflect a contractual agreement to pursue a business arrangement.  Nor does it represent U.S. Postal Service Purchasing Manual procurement and will not be governed by the provisions of the U.S. Postal Service Purchasing Manual.

The U.S. Postal Service is not obligated to enter into any agreements or contracts as a result of this request.  The U.S. Postal Service will not pay for the information solicited under this request.

Issuance of this RFI does not indicate that the U.S. Postal service is planning on implementing these retail units now or in the near future. This is merely a request for information in order to develop business strategies for future retail initiatives.

6.  Where to Send Your Response

Responses should be sent on or before close of business on June 27, via U.S. mail, to:

Bretta Kievit
United States Postal Service
475 L'Enfant Plaza, S.W., Suite 7540

Collective Protection (ColPro) 2005 Conference and Exhibition will be held June 21-23, 2005 and is supported by the The Joint Program Office for Collective Protection (JPM-CP) at Hyatt Regency Monterey, Monterey, CA. The worldwide proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons capabilities, as heightened by recent events, has broadened the range of scenarios in potential of these weapons against U.S. Forces is possible. Additionally, the application of ColPro for Homeland Defense is an expanding area that will also be of interest during this conference. 

The challenge to government, academia, and industry is to provide innovative technologies, concepts, applications and equipment that can be applied to existing and future Joint Collective Protection systems. This includes advanced air purification technologies, improved environmental systems, improved shelter systems and materials, and optimized associated utilities. Current ColPro operating platforms are already constrained by weight, power, and space, demanding that new or upgraded systems incorporate lightweight material, improved transportability, reduced logistics, reduced power requirements, and miniaturization of standardized/modular components. Participation by industry, academia, government and international personnel is encouraged to foster cooperation in meeting the challenges of future efforts.

The rates for the government attendees will be the prevailing 2005 per diem rate (Currently $132*) and $159* for industry. In order to ensure the discounted NDIA rate, please make reservations early and ask for the NDIA Collective Protection Conference. Rooms will not be held after Friday May 20, 2005 and may sell out before then. Rates are also subject to increase after this date.

<SUBJECT>V -- Defense Transportation Coordination Initiative (DTCI) Face-to-Face RFI
<DESC>1.  DESCRIPTION.

This is a Request for Information (RFI).  This synopsis offers an additional opportunity for industry to elaborate on/clarify responses to the RFI and present ideas and comments on the DTCI project in regard to commercial best practices and commercial transportation management capabilities.  The following description and background information was previously posted in our RFI dated 23 Mar 05.

The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is responsible for providing for the transportation needs of the Department of Defense. On 16 Sep 03, the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) designated the Commander, USTRANSCOM as Distribution Process Owner (DPO).  Among the DPO's key responsibilities are to:

•	Improve the overall efficiency and interoperability of distribution-related activities—deployment, sustainment, and deployment support during peace and war.
•	Serve as the single entity to direct and supervise execution of the Strategic Distribution system.

The DPO's span of influence, as depicted on the following page, is from the factory, beginning with acquisition of needed supplies and materials, to the foxhole, from storage, to transport inter-theatre to transport intra-theatre, and to tactical movement and distribution.   

 

DoD service agencies’ current business processes and segregated transportation management arrangements need to be transformed to reach the desired end state of total asset management and in-transit visibility.  The Defense Transportation Coordination Initiative (DTCI) is one project moving DoD closer to achieving this goal, focusing on the movement of requisitioned supplies/materials within the Continental United States (CONUS). 

	a.  DTCI Vision Statement:  Improve the reliability, predictability, and efficiency of DoD materiel moving within the Continental United States through a long-term partnership with a world-class coordinator of transportation management services. 

	b.  Goals:

&#61553;	Improve operational effectiveness
&#61553;	Improve visibility, reliability, & predictability
&#61553;	Improve customer confidence 
&#61553;	Reduce cycle times
&#61553;	Increase efficiencies
&#61553;	Use commercial best practices 
&#61553;	Ensure strong small business participation
&#61553;	Performance improvement enabled by metrics 
&#61553;	Reduce overall cost to the government

	c.  Value Proposition:  Improve performance of distribution to CONUS-  
based operational forces and depots--with corollary dollar savings.
     
	d.  Strategy:  Gain management oversight of enterprise-wide transportation requirements and track performance trends and details.  DTCI will:

•	Provide greater opportunities to generate full truck loads and modal shifts
•	Provide opportunities to achieve efficiency through pooling and enroute consolidation
•	Allow DoD management to re-focus more on bottom-line performance and results
•	Provide needed visibility into system-wide transportation movements
•	Support the capture of more effective, complete, and timely performance metrics
•	Provide performance metrics against desired goals
•	Allow for improved management of resources 
•	Allow DoD management and resources to become focused on achieving further gains in distribution efficiency and effectiveness in the future
•	Manage and coordinate previously decentralized DoD domestic freight movement 

The DoD is committed to continual service improvements that will result in improved support of operational forces based in the US as well as DoD repair depots. Improving visibility of all traffic movement patterns and performance across the supply chain is the key to the creation of an adaptive supply chain.  In addition to operational benefits, the corollary dollar savings that will accrue to the DoD Components from DTCI will be available for other critical needs.

2.  BACKGROUND.

Today, DoD shippers in the CONUS initiate freight movements using commercial freight transportation providers to myriad U.S. destinations, creating thousands of origin-destination pairs.  Multiple information systems are employed to execute and manage shipment activity.  There is no centralized planning, coordination, or control.  Individual DoD shippers act unilaterally by independently selecting transportation mode, level of service, and transportation provider.  There is limited collaborative visibility or coordination of movement requirements and therefore there are limited opportunities to leverage the entire DoD workload to create the volume needed to drive increased velocity and reduced cost.  Such leverage is a well recognized “best practice” in high performing private sector distribution systems.

 

	a.  Scope of DTCI:    DTCI is a CONUS transportation management initiative focused on increasing operational effectiveness while simultaneously obtaining efficiencies by reducing cycle times and using best practices, such as increased consolidations / load optimization and modal conversions.  The premise is for DoD to competitively award a long-term contract with a world-class transportation coordinator/coordinator(s) that will employ best commercial practices to achieve the goals stated above. The coordinator's scope goes beyond traditional freight forwarding and brokerage transactions.  The coordinator will leverage current commercial capabilities and proven best transportation practices of commercial shippers to manage, consolidate, and optimize specified CONUS freight movements using contractor-chosen modes among DoD shippers.  A multiple phased implementation approach is envisioned based on location and possibly functionality.  It is anticipated Phase 1 will begin with the 19 Defense Logistics Agency CONUS distribution centers.  Based on the results of the DLA experience, the next phase may include the current Tailored Transportation Contract participants and other co-located DoD shippers within a specified radius to achieve maximum volume participation and corollary cost savings through consolidation and optimization of freight requirements.  The final phase would include remaining DoD shippers throughout the CONUS. 

The DTCI coordinator must have visibility of targeted freight movement requirements across the CONUS and have immediate access to a nationwide network of transportation providers to schedule and fulfill those requirements.

            b.  Requirements:   The DTCI coordinator(s) will provide transportation management services to arrange, coordinate, monitor, and control outbound freight shipments from receipt of shipment request information through final delivery; process timely payment to subcontractors and carriers for services provided; accept, process, and settle claims resulting from loss or damage; manage carrier quality and performance; and assist in the identification and delivery of astray freight; provide In-Transit Visibility (ITV) information to the government’s Global Transportation Network (GTN) within 4 hours of freight pick-up, delivery, and exception notices (any time a planned delivery will not be delivered as required by the shipper).  The contractor must have a near-real-time shipment tracking system and provide full access to the shipper and other government employees specifically designated by the contracting officer.  The contractor must initiate process improvement (continuous network improvements including shipment optimization, consolidation, routing improvements and other value-added services), and the contractor must provide the contract officer or his or her designee with customized management information reports related to shipment volume, costs, and other criteria that characterize and provide performance-related views of the transactions included in this contract.  The potential number of shipments that may be included in this initiative could exceed 2 million shipments a year with a combined freight weight of over 1 billion pounds per year.  The contractor must have the capability to meet surges for wartime and other contingencies.  This contract will have a phased approach predicated by location, commodities, and possibly functionality. 

          c.  Exclusions:  In the initial phase, the government will exclude arms, ammunition, explosives or fireworks; missiles or rockets; narcotics and dangerous drugs; etiologic agents; government firearms and weapons; live animals; bulk commodities; human remains; coins; currency; precious metals; refrigerated cargo; food, fresh, frozen, or requiring refrigeration; postage stamps or stamped envelopes; express small packages less than 150 pounds; postal shipments; unit moves destined for locations outside of the CONUS (by exception); sensitive and classified shipments or any items requiring transportation security service (Constant Surveillance Service is not excluded), the CONUS segment of transportation services provided under the SDDC Universal Services ocean carrier contracts; household goods, privately owned vehicles,  hazardous waste.  During the period of performance of the contract, and based on competitive pricing analysis, government may add some or all of the initially excluded workload to this contract.

	d.  Phased Approach (Draft):  The initial phase of DTCI is a partnership between the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  The first phase will service 19 DLA depots: 

 

Subsequent phasing will incorporate additional shipping locations to be served, i.e. locations within a 50-mile radius of the DLA depots (to include current TTC sites), service installations, and other DOD shipping activities.  In final phases, the Military Services and other Defense Agencies will be encompassed into a total DoD partnership.  A jointly staffed Project Management Office (PMO) has been established at USTRANSCOM to develop requirements, execute the acquisition, and provide implementation guidance over the life of the project.

           g.  Actions:  Draft requirements documents will be released to industry and the services for comment with notices published on FedBizOpps and on the DTCI website: www.doddtci.org.  The draft solicitation in its entirety will be posted for industry review prior to conducting a pre-solicitation conference and site visit at the DDSP Depot.  During this conference, a detailed briefing of the requirements will be presented, a site visit for offerors to facilitate an understanding of one of the most demanding and highly automated depot pick, pack and pull, operations, current transportation operations.  Also, a similar site visit will be arranged for a different date for offerors to observe operations of a less demanding and less automated depot for the purpose of providing prospective offerors with an opportunity to understand the diversity and volume of workload between the DoD highest volume depots and the lowest depots in the DLS system.  Instructions for proposal preparation will be discussed in conjunction with the source selection evaluation criteria leading to a best value contract award decision.  Specific instructions and information regarding the pre-solicitation conference will be provided as soon as the details are finalized.  Upon issuance of a final solicitation, a pre-proposal conference is anticipated as well.

Their potential application is as heat spreaders within large space radiator panels radiating to a 200 K thermal sink. The contractor will supply a minimum of two heat pipes for NASA to test.  NASA may, at its discretion, purchase as many as four additional heat pipes.  Anticipated NASA tests include comprehensive mapping of heat pipe performance at nominal and off-nominal operating conditions over temperatures ranging from 310-530K.  Ten or more freeze thaw tests will be conducted, which the heat pipe is expected to tolerate with no degradation in performance. The proposals shall clearly describe in detail the proposer’s approach in the following areas: 1.	Heat pipe wick designs and materials to be used. 2.	Estimated heat pipe performance over a range of 310-530 K including estimate of any liquid blockage. 3.	Description of analytical tools and methods used to predict performance estimates, including evidence of correlation of the analytical tools against actual test data for heat pipes of similar size and power. 4.	Heritage and technical readiness of the proposed proposed design as demonstrated by prior relevant work. 5.	This procurement is for straight heat pipes, however, the proposer will discuss in their proposal the feasibility of including an obtuse angle of 95 degrees between the evaporator and condenser. The contractor shall design and fabricate heat pipes to the following specifications: Nominal operating temperature: 500 K Off-Nominal operating temperature range: 310-530K at evaporator Heat pipe heat transfer rate,  Maximize at 500 K Heat pipe outer diameter: 1.27 cm Wall thickness:  22 Gauge tube, minimum.

Weld procedures shall be submitted for each joint configuration. Testing:  Each unit shall either pneumatically or hydrostatically tested. Pneumatic testing is to be performed with dry nitrogen at a pressure equal to the operating pressure x’s 1.1 x’s the ratio of the allowable stress at ambient / the allowable stress at operating temperature. Hydrostatic testing is to be performed with distilled water at a pressure equal to the operating pressure x’s 1.5 x’s the ratio of the allowable stress at ambient / the allowable stress at operating temperature.  After completion of testing units are to be dried with a gaseous nitrogen purge. Shipping: All openings are to be capped and units are to be separated within crate to prevent damage by contact. Deliverables – The contractor shall deliver the following to NASA. 1.	Heat Pipe Design (After Receipt of Order(ARO) + 1 month) – The contractor shall provide a design report to NASA describing the heat pipe design specifications and performance predictions including a detailed basis for the predictions.  2.

 Unlisted classifications needed for work not included within
 the scope of the classifications listed may be added after
 award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses
 (29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (ii)).

 ----------------------------------------------------------------

 prevailing.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------

                    WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

 1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
 be:

 *  an existing published wage determination
 *  a survey underlying a wage determination
 *  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
    a wage determination matter
 *  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

 On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
 for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
 Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
 because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
 Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
 contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
 and 3.) should be followed.

 With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
 process described here, initial contact should be with the
 Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

        Branch of Construction Wage Determinations

        Wage and Hour Division

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
 interested party (those affected by the action) can request
 review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
 (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

        Wage and Hour Administrator

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
 interested party's position and by any information (wage
 payment data, project description, area practice material,
 etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

 3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
 interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
 Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

        Administrative Review Board

        U.S. Department of Labor

        200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

        Washington, DC 20210

 4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-05-R-625615 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is small business set-aside procurement.  The NAICS is 721110.  
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

12.1  The lowest level of security exists in GENERAL ACCESS AREAS.  These AREAS are all of Dyess AFB outside of the "USAF Controlled" and "USAF Restricted" AREAS.
12.2  Dyess Air Force Base is a closed base.  All personnel entering must have specific permission of the installation commander for entry.  This permission is granted when a Contractor employee is issued an identification card.  Information necessary to obtain identification cards will be provided by the Contracting Officer at the pre-performance conference.  The Contractor shall be responsible to ensure that all of its employees obtain, and keep on their person at all times while working on the base, a USAF identification card.  Upon completion of the work or termination of an employee, the Contractor shall be responsible for turn in of identification cards no longer needed to the Contracting Officer or to the Pass and Registration Office of the Security Forces.  Failure to turn in badges will result in last payment of payroll to be withheld and revocation of any future badges issued by Pass and Registration Office to the employee and the contractor.
DYESS FORM 173:
Effective 1 Nov 04, a completed signed original Dyess Form 173 (Mar 04) must be delivered to Pass & ID by 0900 on the duty day prior to the desired day of entry onto Dyess AFB.  The Visitor Control Center will no longer issue temporary passes to contractor personnel unless they have already been previously identified on an executed Dyess Form 173.
All information on the Dyess Form 173 must be typed and the authorizing signature must be in blue or black ink.
Personal information provided on the Dyess Form 173 will be cross-referenced against state and federal criminal databases to identify those individuals possessing outstanding warrants.  Those individuals with outstanding warrants will be detained at the Visitor Control Center on the desired day of entry, and turned over to Abilene Police Department.
If any errors are noted on the form, the approving authority (individual on the 577) can make ink changes in red ink.  All changes have to be initialed by the approval authority.  (Effective Date:  Immediately)
All individuals with Dyess Form 173’s will still continue to be processed via the Texas Law Enforcement Terminal System (TLETS—police wants/warrants check).  Once it is determined the individual is cleared from any wants or warrants, a copy of the Dyess Form 173 will be placed at the Tye Gate entry point.  The Tye Gate Guard will use this form as an Entry Authority List (EAL) allowing contractors onto the installation.  The contractor will then be able to go to the Gate directly (not the Visitor Control Center (VCC) or Arnold Gate) and verify if their Dyess Form 173 is there.  Should their Dyess Form 173 not be there, they will be directed to the VCC for issuance of an AF Form 75.  At this time someone will physically have to meet them there to sponsor them onto the installation.  (Reasons why the form would not be at the guard shack would be erroneous driver’s license number, erroneous information, warrant, or identified as illegal alien).  (Effective Date:  Immediately)
Should their Dyess Form 173 be at the Tye Gate entry point, the contractor will be told to proceed directly to the Pass and Registration Section for the 7 SFS Contractor Badge issue.  The Pass Section will have the original Dyess Form 173.  Once a badge is obtained, they need only show the badge at the installation gate for entry onto the installation.  Please note that neither the Security Forces Control Center nor the Tye Gate Guards will check the Dyess Form 173 for errors.  This is the responsibility of the Pass and Registration Section.  (Effective Date:  Immediately)
The Dyess Form 173 will be maintained at the Tye Gate entry point for 48 hours (two business days).  After the specified time has expired, it will be destroyed.  Should the contractor not process through Tye Gate in that 48-hour period, the contractor will require someone to physically vouch them on base to get a one-day pass at the VCC so they may proceed to the Pass and Registration office for their badge.  The hold period for these forms at the gate can and will be extended should rain days occur or through prior coordination with any affected agency.  (Effective Date:  Immediately)

All contractors must attend a contractor briefing given to the contractors by Pass and Registration who will provide a more detailed explanation regarding contractor badges and their uses.  Pass and Registration reserves the right to not issue a contractor badge due to erroneous information or failure to disclose information on the Dyess Form 173.  Any derogatory information received from the background check will result in the non-issuance of the contractor badge.
The Dyess AFB Form Letter 173 is subject to the privacy act of 1974, Authority:  10 U.S.C. 8012 and 5 U.S.C. 552a (b) (7).  
Principle purposes:  To provide the 7th Security Forces Squadron, and other authorized agencies, with a listing of personnel authorized access to Dyess Air Force Base, Texas as Contractors or Contractor employees.
Routine Uses:  To verify the identity of personnel entering Dyess AFB as Contractors.
Disclosure is Mandatory:  Failure to provide the information and Social Security Number (SSN) could result in denied access to the Dyess AFB installation.
13.  IDENTIFICATION OF CONTRACTOR VEHICLES:  Contractor vehicles must be marked on each side with company name with either permanent or semi-permanent/magnetic signage.

The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-05-R-625615 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is small business set-aside procurement.  The NAICS is 721110.  
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.
Award will be based on the following criteria:  Past Performance experience will be evaluated.  Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussion with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain its best terms.  The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using sn accordance with FAR Part 13.5.
