<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contemplates an award for laboratory services for Tuberculosis Control Activities in the U.S.-affiliated Pacific Island Jurisdictions (USAPI).  The project objective is to provide support to implement the laboratory component in the National TB Program from Clinical Laboratory Improvement Advisory (CLIA)-approved laboratories which address the components specific to the USAPI.  TB laboratory resources are not readily available in the USAPI therefore creating a barrier for CDC to ensure full implementation of an effective TB control program.  In addition, without effective TB laboratory services, CDC is unable to ensure the provision of timely laboratory and medical consultation as well as program technical assistance.  Currently, the infrastructure and resources in the USAPI cannot support the TB laboratory needs promulgated by CDC.  However, many of the USAPI utilize laboratories located in Hawaii and the U.S. mainland for their reference laboratory service needs.  This effort seeks to expand this existing method to support TB laboratory activities and enable CDC to complete its agenda.  CDC seeks to secure services to provide TB laboratory testing, technical assistance and training for the USAPI and to implement a regional TB quality assurance plan.  The period of performance will be 12 months with 2 option years for a total of 36 months.

The minimum qualifications for the offerors are  (1) offeror must already function as Biosafety Level 3 lab, have infection control program, and is compliant with recommended biosafety practices and facility design as indicated by CDC. See criteria for biosafety level 3 laboratory or BSL 3 laboratory at http://www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/biosfty/bmbl4/bmbl4s3.htm. (2) offeror is 
CLIA laboratory certified and can provide evidence of current CLIA certification and (3) offeror is  International Air Transportation Association (IATA) trained and certified and can provide evidence of successful completion of IATA approved training for the transportation of dangerous goods (infectious substances and diagnostic specimens) and produce proper shipping, importation, exportation permits for infectious and diagnostic specimens. See www.iata.org.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code for this procurement is 621511 ? Medical Laboratories.  CDC will consider all responsible sources responding to this Request for Proposal (RFP).  The RFP number 2007-N-09182 will be available on or about 15 days from the date of this pre-solicitation notice.  The due date for receipt of proposals will be 30 days after posting of the RFP.  All questions/concerns about the RFP shall be submitted via email to GSanders@cdc.gov. The complete solicitation package will be available and posted at fedbizopps website for downloading when issued.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

SUBPART 5301.91 -- OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM
5301.9101 Purpose.
The purpose of the Air Force ombudsman program is to foster communication between government and industry. The primary function of the ombudsman is to consider concerns about specific issues in acquisitions, to communicate these concerns to senior management personnel responsible for oversight, and to assist in the resolution of the concerns. 
5301.9102 Policy.
(a) MAJCOM and DRU commanders shall appoint an experienced senior official who is independent of the contracting officer and program manager as the ombudsman at their MAJCOM/DRU. For AFMC and AFSPC Centers, an ombudsman is required at each Center, instead of at the MAJCOM. 
(b) The ombudsman will have the authority to call upon other resources of the activity to assist in resolving acquisition issues or concerns (e.g. administrative support, independent review teams). 
(c) Contracting officers shall identify the ombudsman in the initial announcement of the acquisition as well as in the draft and final RFP. 
(d) The ombudsman shall: 
(1) Act neutrally to facilitate resolution of issues or concerns raised by concerned parties; 
(2) Act in a manner that does not compromise the concerned party, and, if requested, maintain anonymity of the parties
(3) Avoid any appearance of usurping normal procurement authority (e.g., program manager, contracting officer, and source selection authority); 
(4) Ensure all affected or knowledgeable offices and officials are consulted as part of any resolution process;
(5) Inform the commander, as required, of issues raised and actions taken; for AFMC and AFSPC centers, report only to the Center Commander, Laboratory Commander, or PEO; and for other MAJCOM/DRUS, report only to the MAJCOM CC or PEO;
(6) Review complaints relative to multiple-award task and delivery order contracts awarded under 10 U.S.C. 2304a(d)(1)(B) or 2304b(e) to ensure that all contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered for task and delivery orders in excess of $2,500, consistent with the procedures in the contract; 
(7) Consistent with security requirements, have access to the appropriate offices and be allowed to collect all facts relevant to the resolution of issues raised by concerned parties. Ombudsmen are granted access to proprietary information. Source selection information must be obtained through the source selection authority.
(e) The Ombudsman Program does not replace the agency level protest, GAO bid protest or disputes processes. 
(f) The Air Force ombudsman is the Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), who may take action to assist in resolving issues, concerns, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, or those having Air Force wide implications. 
(g) Government personnel may use the Ombudsman Program as a way to express concerns about an acquisition.
5301.9103 Solicitation provision and contract clause.
Insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, in all solicitations (including draft solicitations) and contracts.
*****
5305.207 Preparation and Transmittal of Synopsis 

(20) In all synopsis announcing competitive or sole source acquisitions, the contracting officer shall indicate that the clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable.
*****
5316.505 Ordering. (Deleted)
*****
5352.201-9101 Ombudsman. 

As prescribed in 5301.9103, insert the following clause: 
OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, [Insert names, addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, and e-mail addresses]. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.
(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.
(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.
(End of clause)

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, on behalf of the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory(MCWL), intends to award a Sole Source contract to FATS Inc. for the following items:  1) 0001 Terrain Database Development of Irish Wash Training Area 2). Terrain Database Development of Blue Mountain Training Area. The rationale for other than full and open competition is that the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory is currently working with Fire Arms Training Systems Inc. on initiatives of simulation, namely the Indirect Fire Forward Air Controller Trainer (I-FACT).   24 months of experimentation has been conducted utilizing the I-FACT, and the need to acquire additional terrain databases depicting USMC training areas has arisen.  These data bases will be of training areas used by USMC in Yuma, Arizona so that realistic simulation can be done before units conduct live fire.  The development of data bases depicting USMC training areas will allow for units to rehearse operations on t!  he ground which live fire will be conducted.  The training areas to be developed for the I-FACT are probable venues for MCWLs TAC-CFF.  The terrains to be developed will be the Irish Wash and Blue Mountain training areas, with development software capable of interfacing both the new IFACT system and the previously procured IFACT system.  Through experimentation MCWL has proven that the use of a medium fidelity simulator is an integral piece of meeting the demands which will arise from the implementation of a Distributed Operations (DO) capability, MCWL has been using the Indirect Fire-Forward Air Controller Trainer (IFACT) for the past two years.  MCWL owns five (5) systems which are spread across the fleet for training and data-collection.  Currently, the only available terrain which depicts USMC training areas is the Delta Corridor Training Area at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC) Building 13373D Battalion 11th Marines Supply   29 Palms California.  The!   incorporation of USMC training areas for use in rehearsal type traini ng will better prepare units for training events, and greatly enhance the effectiveness of live fire events.  In order to continue experimentation using the laptop trainer, software capable of interfacing with the existing trainer is required, in order to continue the next upcoming experimentation. Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Purchase Request number for this acquisition is M67854-07-Q-9001. The North American Industry C!  lassification System (NAICS) code is 541512. Any inquiries about this announcement should be directed to Ms. Delzoria Hawkins via e-mail at  Delzoria.Hawkins@usmc.mil. Inquiries shall be made no later than 8 November 2006 before 4:00 EST .

The selection process will consist of a Best Value source selection based on organizational past performance, organizational experience, key personnel and price.  Under a Best Value source selection, non-price evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.  However, EOUSA will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.  In order to select the winning proposal, EOUSA will rank each offeror by making a series of paired comparisons between them, trading off the marginal differences in capability with the marginal difference in price.  

This procurement is a 100% Small Business Set Aside.  The NAICS code for this solicitation is 541611.  The Government?s estimate is $200,000.00. The actual period of performance will be determined at the time of award; however we anticipate awarding a one year contract with one option year.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate solely with Softbase Systems, Inc. of 1200 Ridgefield Blvd. Suite 290 Asheville NC USA 28806, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13.106-1 (b) (1) as the Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of the procurement deem only once source reasonably available.  This requirement will be to purchase maintenance on Government owned SOFTBASE SYSTEMS software currently installed on System 81 (LPAR only) in SSA?s National Computer Center (NCC).
<P>
Maintenance support for the DGF software must be renewed, effective November 30, 2006 through November 29, 2007.  Maintenance support provides the required software fixes, corrections and revisions necessary to ensure a stable processing environment.  Without maintenance support, the SSA software developers would experience degraded service, which would impact software development deadlines.  This software is a DB2 test and development support tool, used in the construction and maintenance of an application test environment.  SSA uses this software for the creation of realistic and representative test data essential to the integrity of SSA?s programs.  The DGF software helps to streamline and simplify SSA?s application development environment, while satisfying applicable security and privacy requirements.  The vendor (Softbase Systems, Inc.) owns all proprietary rights to the software's source code.  The vendor is the only responsible sole source for maintenance support, upgrades, update and fixes; no other source can maintain the software or provide the relevant software upgrades. 
<P>
The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed purchase order for the maintenance and software license upgrades. Other organizations possessing the requisite expertise and resources are invited to submit information concerning their capabilities, expertise, and other pertinent data. Pricing data may be submitted. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. This is not a request for quotation and the Government does not intend to pay for information received. If SSA does not identify other acceptable sources capable of providing the software maintenance, SSA shall issue a sole source award under FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures for the period of 11/30/06 through 11/29/07. Responses to this notice should be submitted by Noon on November 1, 2006. Request for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. Oral communications are not acceptable.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Automated Profiling/Screening Tool (Software)
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-9222-06-1020
<RESPDATE>120806

<CONTACT>Patrice Coleman, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-594-2016, Fax 410-965-9560, Email patrice.coleman@ssa.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to advise interested parties that the Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to release a Requests for Proposals (RFP) for the services of a contractor to develop an automated, Section 508 compliant, profiling/screening tool (software) for identifying Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) disability decisions to FedBizOpps and will upload the solicitation document when issued.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement for the services of a contractor to develop an automated, Section 508 compliant*, profiling/screening tool (software) for identifying Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) disability decisions that are likely to be appealed to federal district court and remanded or reversed by the court.  The contractor may also recommend the purchase and/or modification of an existing Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) software package for the profiling/screening tool if an existing product can be identified.

On March 31, 2006, SSA published the final rules establishing a new disability determination and administrative appeals process effective August 1, 2006.  Under the new rules SSA is gradually phasing out the Appeals Council?s review of disability claims and replacing it with a review by a Decision Review Board (DRB).  The DRB will focus on identifying decision-making errors as well as policies and procedures that will improve decision-making at all levels of the disability determination process. 

SSA intends to select ALJ decisions for review by the DRB in several different ways, including the use of computer-based predictive screening tools.  It is envisioned that a sophisticated computer-based profiling/screening tool could be developed to help identify unfavorable ALJ decisions that contain characteristics associated with federal district court appeals and remands or reversals.  The profiling model will be developed using data recorded at the time of the initial level determination, ALJ decision, Appeals Council review, and the court action.  This information includes the applicant?s age, education years, primary impairment, reason for the court remand, etc.  The methods for selecting cases for DRB review are expected to evolve over time as more data are available and SSA gains more experience and knowledge in the use of computer-based tools.  Any software will make use of current SSA databases and systems architecture already available, if applicable.

*Note:  Any products and/or services the Government intends to acquire must allow the Government to support its obligations under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  See http://www.ssa.gov/oag/acq/oagacq_508.htm for more information.

Detailed specifications will be provided in the solicitation document.

<DESC>This synopsis is for a Thousands-Blocks Pooling Administration requirement.  This synopsis is prepared in accordance with FAR Subparts 5.2 and 6.3.  The synopsis serves to give notice of the Government's intent to negotiate and issue a sole source bridge contract in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  This bridge contract is necessary to provide a continuation of critical services until the ongoing recompetition of the pooling administration services requirement is completed.  Pooling administration services are critical to preventing the exhaustion of numbering resources in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) and must therefore be provided without interruption.  Interruption of pooling administration services would result in a more rapid depletion of numbering resources nationwide and a return to the near-crisis state of the NANP that existed prior to implementation of pooling administration. The requirement obligates the contractor to serve as an independent designated entity responsible for administering Thousands-Block number pools by assigning, managing, forecasting, reporting and processing data that will allow service providers in rate areas designated for Thousands-Block number pooling to receive telephone numbers in blocks of 1,000.  Thousands-Block number pooling is a resource optimization strategy which enables carriers to receive telephone numbers in blocks of 1,000, rather than 10,000, thereby promoting a more efficient and effective use of numbering resources.  The Government intends to award a sole source bridge contract to NeuStar, Inc., the incumbent contractor.   NeuStar, Inc. has been providing the critical, highly specialized services described above to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) since 2001.  The existing contract is scheduled to expire on November 14, 2006.  The transition period from the incumbent to a new service provider is anticipated to last several months.  Due to the considerable transition period anticipated, the FCC has determined that only one contractor - NeuStar, Inc. - is capable of meeting the critical need for uninterrupted continuation of the pooling administration services for an interim period until completion of the ongoing recompetition.  Accordingly, award to any other source other than NeuStar, Inc. would result in an unacceptable interruption in fulfilling FCC mission requirements and could severely jeopardize the success of continuing to generate and implement the program as required by statute.  While it may be technically possible for other companies to provide the required services after a considerable transition period, the FCC believes that no contractor other than NeuStar, Inc. is capable of providing interim services beginning November 15, 2006 until the ongoing recompetition is completed.  Pooling Administration must continue to be provided without interruption.  Services are to cover a three-month period of performance with options for two, one-month periods of performance.  Award is anticipated prior to November 10, 2006.  Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by addressing how it would be able to perform the interim services from November 15, 2006 until the ongoing recompetition is completed.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   However, all capability statements received within 15 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the FCC.  A determination by the FCC not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the FCC.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A presolicitation announcement of the recompetition requirement was publicized on May 8, 2006.  Interested vendors must contact Tony Wimbush, Contract Specialist, FCC/Contracts & Purchasing Center, @ 202-418-0932 or via email @ anthony.wimbush@fcc.gov.

<DESC>Invitation to 10 Print Capture Industry Day

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of State (DOS), Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Defense (DoD), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), jointly defined an urgent, near-term demand for faster, smaller, more mobile, 10 fingerprint slap capture devices to meet critical national security needs.  These departments organized a unified User Group, developed standardized requirements, and co-sponsored a ?Challenge to Industry? as the first step towards meeting these common needs.  These requirements represented the consensus position of the participants of the User Group.

The purpose of this notice is to invite fingerprint scanner hardware and software vendors to a 10 Print Capture Industry Day, to be held at ?The Top of the Town?, 1400 North 14th Street, Arlington, VA  22209 on November 13, 2006 from 1:00PM to 5:00PM.

During the Industry Day, the User Group will provide more detailed information about the requirements, clarify business needs, and communicate plans from the government agencies.  Vendors with 10-Print capture devices meeting the attached requirements are invited to display their capture device.  If you are interested in displaying your 10-Print capture device you must pre-register.  Please plan on arriving an hour before the 1:00PM start time in order to set-up your device.  Note:  Display space is limited to a 6?X2? table and you must supply your own power sources (i.e. power strips, extension cords, etc.). 

Attached to this announcement are the User Group revised set of requirements and a vendor questionnaire.  Interested vendors are requested to pre-register and provide answers to the attached Vendor Questionnaire.  Also, vendors are encouraged to submit any questions with regards to the 10 print capture initiative to the User Group.  Please submit the answers to the questionnaire and your questions to the User Group by Friday, November 3rd, 2006 electronically Mr. Stanley Robinson at Stanley.Robinson@dhs.gov.

We are requesting that each vendor limit participation to no more than three persons.  Each attendee is requested to provide the following information electronically to Mr. Robinson not later than Friday, November 3rd, 2006.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: an ombudsman had been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.  The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g. agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsman, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil.  Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, fax number (703) 588-1067.  The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>This sources sought is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S Government.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) seeks to identify potential small business sources that could function as the prime contractor for an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) contract.  Interested parties are hereby requested to provide a Statement of Capabilities (SOC).
NAVAIR deployed its enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution, Sigma, in October 2002 and has been in the operations and support (O&S) phase of the program since that time.  PMA 203 provides functional O&S support for the Sigma ERP deployed solution at NAVAIR under the guidance of a Government/integrator team.  O&S tasks are typically accomplished through integrated product or project teams, comprised of Government and contractor personnel, supporting business areas such as financial, procurement, human resources, and other elements of the NAVAIR Sigma solution. Sigma is scheduled to transition to Navy ERP in October 2007 with full retirement in December 2007.  As Sigma is replaced by Navy ERP, NAVAIR will establish a Business Office that will be the primary location for NAVAIR Navy ERP expertise and provide a central point for resolution of NAVAIR Navy ERP matters. 

This contract will provide support for continued O&S performance of the Sigma system, NAVAIR Navy ERP implementation efforts, and the establishment of the NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office.  The Government views these primary tasks as a three-phased approach of distinct yet interrelated efforts resulting in an overlap of one task area within the next.  Support areas required for each effort is outlined below:
	
	1) Sigma Operations and Support
The goal of this phase is to provide continued sustainment levels of operational support through close-out of the Sigma ERP system.  In performance of this phase, the contractor shall support NAVAIR business processes as deployed in Sigma, maintain data integrity of the system, identify and resolve any issues, and complete requirements for external mandates.  O&S will continue to be fully operational up until one month after Navy ERP Go-Live with a final Annual Close for FY07 conducted within the operational period.  In this phase, the contractor shall perform services in areas such as testing, configuration management, requirements management, functional support, analysis, and role management under the guidance of the government/integrator team.  Mandated system changes and deficiencies will require analysis, requirements and solution development, testing and implementation.  The contractor shall also support the Customer Support Center (CSC) which provides services to NAVAIR by providing communications and liaison between Sigma ERP and internal and external customers and organizations and by disseminating information regarding Sigma ERP via multiple venues.   The CSC also supports resolution of customer issues through its Help Desk and Role Management activities, updating of ERP website information, and compiling metrics to gauge.

2) NAVAIR Navy ERP Implementation
The goal of this phase is to serve as the focal point for successful Navy ERP Implementation at NAVAIR.  To achieve this goal, support shall be required for the transition from the Sigma ERP System to the Navy ERP system in the areas of change management, data management, test support, and training support across all SAP modules including  FI, FM, CO, MM, PS, SD, HR, WF, IM, AM and BW.  Implementation support is currently on-going and will continue through complete Sigma phase out which is projected to be three months after Navy ERP Go-Live. 

3) NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office
	As Sigma is replaced by Navy ERP, the primary NAVAIR interaction with Navy ERP regarding their deployed NAVAIR solution will be through the NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office.  The goal of the Business Office will be to serve as the NAVAIR center of excellence for Navy ERP business operations and functional process sustainment.  Additionally, the Business Office will minimize impact of Navy ERP deployment and implementation on current and new users.  The Business Office will provide a central point for resolution of NAVAIR Navy ERP matters, ensure that business process and technical areas are in sync, and will be the primary location for NAVAIR Navy ERP expertise.  All NAVAIR requirements for Navy ERP, to include deficiencies, will be processed and prioritized through this organization to represent the NAVAIR Process Owner needs.  The Business Office will be responsible for key stakeholder coordination, business and functional process management, deficiency identification, data management and reporting, user and role management, sustainment training management, customer advocacy, and liaison with the Navy ERP Program Management Office (PMO).  In addition, the Business Office will provide strategic recommendations to the NAVAIR leadership on the health, business operations, and recommendations for improvement based on the data obtained from the Navy ERP system.  The NAVAIR Navy ERP Business Office will officially stand up at Navy ERP Go-Live which is projected for 1 October 2007 and remain in effect indefinitely.  The contractor shall support the following efforts: testing, quality assurance, training, data management, reporting, system deficiency recognition and resolution, requirements management, business Process Owner support and project management support.  The contractor shall also provide customer support for NAVAIR.
Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding upon the Government.  The Government will not be responsible for SOC preparation costs.   Submissions should be electronically in a MS Office compatible format to yarinee.tafur@navy.mil.  Note that submissions will not be returned.  Responses to this announcement must be received no later than 02 Nov 2006, 4:00PM EST.  Submit any questions electronically to yarinee.tafur@navy.mil, no phone calls will be accepted or returned.  Answers to the questions will be posted in this website.

<SOLNBR>R3063209
<CONTACT>Eileen Flanigan, Contract Specialist, Phone 215-446-5816, Fax 215-446-4212, Email eileen.flanigan@gsa.gov
<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Technology Service (FTS), Mid-Atlantic Region intends to solicit on a full and open competition basis using FAR Part 13.5 procedures twelve (12) Sybase ASE Enterprise Edition CPU Licenses (Platform- Sun Solaris SPARC 64 Bit, Manufacturer Catalog Number 13839) with Extended Support.	

The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 511210.  The size standard is $23.0 million.

The solicitation will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website on or about October 30, 2006.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be issued by GSA.  Prospective offerors are responsible for monitoring this website for any updates.

Questions regarding this posting shall be directed to Ms. Eileen Flanigan at Eileen.Flanigan@gsa.gov or Mr. Michael Shepherd at Michael.Shepherd@gsa.gov.

Modification 1 is issued to post a brand name justification for purchase of the required Sybase Licenses.

Brand Name Justification
Sybase ASE licenses  

The justification is to purchase Sybase ASE licenses for Defense Security Services (DSS). The DSS application Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) was developed with and is currently in production using Sybase ASE. JPAS supports the entire DoD for adjudication and management of personnel security clearances. JPAS is currently in production and is expected to provide increased functionality to the DoD, Federal, and DIB user communities. In order to provide the expected increase in functionality additional Sybase ASE license are required.  The use of the Sybase licenses reduces the amount of development time that would be needed if a different Relational Data Base Management system is procured, thus increasing overall productivity and best value to the government. 


As such, purchase of the brand name items is justified and will result in lower manpower costs to operate and maintain the platform. A common platform for JPAS will streamline maintenance and operational requirements, resulting in lower training and troubleshooting costs attributable to standard diagnostics, configuration and support; will simplify management of licenses and warranties, and maximize compatibility and reliability. These requested additional licenses are essential elements for DSS to minimize downtime, enhance efficient and effective operations. This is especially true of IT products where the risk of increased cost (at an exponential rate) is very high in the face of any downtime since the productivity of DSS?s work is vastly dependent on the reliability of its computer operations.

<RESPDATE>110106
<ARCHDATE>12012006
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   Amendment #1 TECHNICAL QUESTIONS Question #1:  Can the proposal be submitted electronically? Answer:  Yes, as stated in the Fed Biz Ops Announcement, "Offers shall submit 1 copy of their quotation that references RFQ-OH-07-00007, no later than October 27, 2006 at 3:00  PM (EST) to Scott A. Fogle, at fogle.scott@epa.gov or via fax at 513 487-2107".  The preferred method is email (electronically), but fax is also acceptable.   Question #2:  The announcement mentions a "quotation".  Is a budget break-down required?  Answer:  Yes, a price estimate shall include a  break-down of costs for each task, including the Optional Tasks and travel costs as identified in the SOW.    Question #3:  Are there limits to the format of the proposal - length, print size, etc.?  Answer:  The Technical Proposal shall be no more than 10 pages in length, with a 12 point font.   Question #4:  The project is titled "Toxicological Effects of Sulfur in Experimental Animals and In vitro Test Systems" but in several places in the Statement of Work, it indicates that expertise other than that of toxicologists is required.  For example, page 2 of the SOW indicates that:   "Under this order, the EPA seeks the professional services of an expert scientist(s) to accomplish the tasks described in the statement of work, with respect to assessing human health risks from SOx exposure."  Answer:  The above mentioned statement which is the concluding paragraph of the  introduction to the statement of work, is a generic one reflecting the over all expectations of the EPA for this scientific requirement.  The EPA would like to again state that, the statement of work is for the critical evaluation of toxicological evidence from laboratory animals and invitro test  systems only.  However, where ever there are parallels and possible extrapolations to exposure and health risk in humans, as the EPA PO sees pertinent to the critical evaluation or support to a particular toxicological study, the EPA would request that every effort be made, to address the  evaluation along those lines.  Question #5:  In Attachment 2, it describes several areas which the document is to address - "Air Quality and Atmospheric Chemistry, Exposure, and Health Effects".  The Attachment goes on to indicate that a number of questions will be considered.  Included are  questions such as: "What is the nature of health effects in individuals/animals exposed to multi-pollutant mixtures?..? (See answer below under question #6) Questions #6:  In "Uncertainties" on page 18 (Attachment 2), it mentions "uncertainties due to confounding by meteorological factors",  "uncertainties due to other confounding factors in epidemiologic studies (e.g., demographic and lifestyle attributes, genetic susceptibility factors, occupational exposure, and medical care)" Under "Susceptible Populations", there are questions regarding susceptible populations such as the elderly,  individuals with pre-existing cardiac or respiratory diseases, and children. Thus the question is, "Should the proposal describe expertise other than toxicology (e.g., chemists, epidemiologists)?  Answer:  To sum up the answers for all the questions listed here on attachment 2; --- Attachment 2  describes the EPA's overall goals and vision of how the science assessment document should be.  The EPA is looking at a global integration of information that will aid us understand the health risk from sulfur dioxide exposure from all spheres as pertinent to human health risk assessment.   Additionally, if optional task 7B is exercised by the EPA it would be reasonably expected that overall integration of toxicological evidence with relevant epidemiological data from the angles such as cofounders, mixtures, genetic variances, exposure as relevant, be thoroughly evaluated.  If the EPA  PO identifies there is a need for such integration of toxicology data with meteorological/atmospheric findings, the EPA may decide the expertise from those angles are needed for the satisfactory production of the Science Assessment (SA) document.  Finally, there are other SOx requirements which  have been awarded and are making a more thorough integration of meteorological data and exposures to human exposures.    Question #7:  What is the required level and type of documentation needed for the cost proposal?  See the answer to question #2.    Questions #8:  Please provide an example of  the SASD or SA, for the depth of analysis.  If there is no document that can be provided, is it reasonable to assume that the depth  of writing is comparable to that in Air Quality Criteria Documents (AQCD)?    Answer: The EPA requests you to view the recent AQCD on lead and ozone from the EPA  website for an estimate of the depth of analysis.  However, the EPA is trying to keep the present Science Assessment (SA) and support document much more concise and are expecting all the toxicology evidence to come in 75- 100 pages.  The SA is the new format that is being introduced and hence has  no template as such.  However, integrated synthesis chapters from the documents referred above should provide some basis and understanding of how the EPA will integrate the information from all sources of evidence. The EPA expects the SA documents will be around 150- 200 pages. The toxicology  aspect of the SA may be 30-40 pages. Question #9:  Is human data (epidemiology data, clinical studies) included in the SOW at all?   Answer:  Under this SOW, the EPA is only expecting the critical evaluation of toxicological evidence from laboratory animals and in vitro test systems.  However, in  the introduction where a summary of events from the past documents is given and also in the brief statements that are made in the beginning    of each section on the over all progress in the scientific work covering that area, brief statements on epidemiological and clinical evidence that is  relevant to  toxicology are normally covered.  In addition, all along the critique of the scientific evidence pertaining to the toxicology, where ever, relevant parallels and extrapolations to the human exposures, from both clinical and epidemiological work is found most appropriate, the EPA  expects that every effort shall be made to bring the discussion along those lines.   Question #10:  Is the document covered by the SOW intended to include the data addressed in earlier documents, or to be an update from those documents?  If the former, will an electronic copy of those earlier  documents be provided?       Answer:  A brief summary of the scientific eveidence at the begining of each section as an introduction to the toxicology chapter covering the scientific evidence as presented in the previous document (that includes the latest addendum) is required for this requirement.    Either electronic versions or the hard copies of the past SO2 document will be provided once the order is placed.  Question #11:  What is the time frame that the literature survey and study summary should cover?  The 1994 supplement to the Second Addendum, the 1986 Second Addendum, or from the  1982 SOx AQCD?  Answer:  Although, the main focus of attention would be a thorough critique of the pertinant literature from 1994 onwards, the introductory summary statements can build historic perspective from the 1986 addendum as well. Question #12:  The SOW states under item 10, that the  detailed critical analysis of all toxicological studies on SOx health effects is beyond the scope of this document.  However, it also states that of most importance for present purposes are those studies which provide useful qualitative or quantitative information on exposure-effect or  exposure-response relationships for health effects.  Is there any guidance on distinguishing these two types of studies?  Answer:  Note: Any toxicological evidence without serious methodological flaws from 1994 onwards is inclusive in this evaluation. Limitations in the methodologies, if any  perceived, would be discussed in the critique.  While, not excluding any relevant evidence, the EPA is expecting that studies reflective of ambient levels, exposure routes that are appropriate to human exposure scenarios, studies of animal disease models and clinical end points, shall be given  their due weightage.  Question #13:  Which of the scientific issues listed in Attachment 2 are covered by this SOW?  How do the issues listed in Attachment 2 relate to the proposed outline (Attachment 3).  For example, uncertainties, biological mechanisms of action, and susceptible populations are  not explicitly included in the outline, although issues related to them could be worked into the outline.  Are these topics covered in the SOW and chapter 5?    Answer:  Attachement #2 describes the EPA's overall goals and vision of how the SA shall be completed.  The EPA is looking at a global  integration of information that will aid in understanding the overall health effects from ambient sulfur dioxide exposure.   If, optional task 7B is exercised, the contractor shall include the overall integration of toxicological evidence with relevant epidemiological data from the angles such as  cofounders, mixtures, genetic variences, exposure as pertinant to be thoroughly evaluated and integrated.  To sum up, while, the statement of work as described, covers all the toxicological evidence from 1994, the SA document will focus on studies that are more relevant for integration of evidence  with human exposure, clinical, controlled and other human studies, that can be extrapolated to human exposure scenarios. The outline in attachment 3 strictly limits to toxicological evidence with the extrapolations to human studies at the most appropriate instances.    Question #14:   What are the  criteria for including a study in the main text under chapter 5 vs. including it in the Annex tables?  Answer:  Annex tables will have the details of every single original research study reported under the statement of work.  It shall cover the study details such as species/cell type ( in case of  invitro studies) dose, duration, type of compound, exposure route, and the salient study findings etc.  For the format please refer to the EPA's recent AQCD on lead.   Question #15:  Task 4 includes review of "the entire" Toxicology chapter.  Please provide information on the content of the  Toxicology chapter that is not being written under this SOW.  Answer:  All the areas of toxicology are covered under the present SOW.  Question #16:   How many people, from the author team for the work under this SOW, should attend the peer review meetings?   Answer:  Only the author(s) that  significantly contribute and act as an internal reviewer of the document in the team, should attend the meeting.     Question #17:  Task 7a is entitled preparation of the SA, but the text under the title refers to revising and finalizing the SA.  How many drafts will there be for the SA, and under  what task is the first draft written?  Answer:  Task 7a is an optional task for the preparation of the Science Assessment document and is an optional task.  An initial and revised draft will be needed under this task if exercised.  Additionally, the initial and revised draft will be written under  Optional Task 7a.   Question #18:  Based on the specified level of effort and the complexity of the database for this chemical, judgments will be needed regarding the data that are included.  Is it appropriate to caveat the proposal with clearly laid out assumptions to further define the scope of  work?  Answer:  Yes, provide all assumptions upfront with your quote. The detailing on technical direction of the SOW will be addressed during the 1st teleconference when the expanded outline is received, (Task 2) under the SOW.   NOTE:   Due to the delay in answering the technical questions  received, the due date for quotes has been extended to Wednesday, November 1, 2006 NLT 12:00PM (EST).   NCEA TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR SERVICES This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented  with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-07-00007.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-13.  A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.   The NAICS code is 541620.   STATEMENT OF WORK I.  Project Identification:  Consultation for Air Quality Science Assessment for Sulfur Oxides:  Toxicological Effects of Oxides of Sulfur in Experimental Animals and In vitro Test Systems II.  Period of Performance:   24 months from award date III.   Type of Purchase Order:  Firm Fixed Price (inclusive of all travel costs and fees) IV.  Estimated Level of Effort:   503 hours for Tasks 1-8 (162 hours for Optional Tasks (7a, 9, and 10) Background The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).   As part of this process, the National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) reviews and integrates new scientific information on the pollutant in a Science Assessment (SA), historically known as an Air  Quality Criteria Document (AQCD). The EPA is now in the process of reviewing the NAAQS for sulfur oxides (SOx).  On April 30, 1971, the EPA promulgated primary NAAQS for SO2 at 0.14 parts per million (ppm), averaged over a period of 24 hours and not to be exceeded more than once per year, and  0.030 ppm annual arithmetic mean based on the findings outlined in the original 1970 AQCD, Air Quality Criteria for Sulfur Oxides.  In 1982, EPA published the Air Quality Criteria for Particulate Matter and Sulfur Oxides along with an addendum of newly published controlled human exposure studies,  which updated the scientific criteria upon which the initial standards were based.  A second addendum presenting newly available evidence from epidemiologic and human controlled exposure studies was published in 1986 followed by a supplement to the second addendum in 1994.  On April 26, 1988, the  EPA announced its proposed decision not to revise the standards for SOx.  In that notice, the Administrator also solicited comment on an alternative of adding a 1- hour primary standard of 0.4 ppm.  On November 15, 1994, the EPA proposed not to revise the 24 hour and annual standard but solicited  comments on adding a new 5-minute standard of 0.60 ppm, with one expected exceedance. The final decision on May 22, 1996 stated that revisions of the NAAQS for SOx was not appropriate at that time.  The schedule for the current review of the NAAQS for SOx is the subject of ongoing litigation and  will eventually be established as a court-ordered schedule.  The EPA's proposed schedule includes a commitment for completion of the SOx SA by September 2008, in order to provide the scientific basis for re-evaluation of the SOx air quality standard.  The EPA's proposed schedule also includes a  number of target dates for interim steps in the development of the SOx SA, including completion of the first draft of the SOx SA by June 2007. The scientific information on SOx shall be reviewed and summarized in a Science Assessment Support Document (SASD) and the Science Assessment (SA).  The  first draft of the SASD will be reviewed at an authors review meeting sponsored by the EPA. This draft SASD will be revised to produce a peer review draft that shall be reviewed by peer reviewers at a public meeting.  Peer review comments will be incorporated in the draft final SASD.  After the  peer review comments are incorporated to the draft final SASD, the SA (a  focused integrative document) shall be prepared as an external review draft  for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) of the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB), and for  public comment.  The EPA  anticipates preparing two drafts of the SOx SA for public and CASAC review, before completion of the final SOx SA. EPA NCEA is seeking to retain the professional services of scientists to assist with the review, critical evaluation summary and integration of the available scientific database on  SOx physical and chemical properties, measurement methods, environmental sources, concentrations, and pathways to human exposure, environmental effects, toxicological and human effects, and an evaluation of health risks to include public health significance. Under this order, the EPA seeks the  professional services of an expert scientist(s) to accomplish the tasks described in the statement of work, with respect to assessing human health risks from SOx exposure. ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments 1-3, the EPA could not post the entire  information to the Fed Biz Ops website.  If a contractor or consultant is interested in this requirement, please submit a request in writing via email to Scott Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov requesting an electronic copy of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria and Attachments.

5. MARKET VALUE: $ 91,507 - $ 118,957 per annum (GS 15  equivalent) 
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: February 2006-February 2008
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo 
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 
A.	Basic Function of the Position

Based in Pristina, the Senior Energy Advisor will be assigned to the USAID/Kosovo Economic Growth Office and will be responsible for development and oversight of the Mission?s energy sector policies and activities.  The Senior Energy Advisor will serve as the Mission?s principal technical resource on energy sector development and as the Mission?s primary point of contact on matters relating to energy programming.  As a highly qualified professional, substantial reliance will be placed on the Senior Energy Advisor to independently plan and carry out the specific activities entailed in fulfilling major duties and responsibilities.  Energy is one of the Mission?s most challenging, high-profile and important sectors, requiring constant interaction with Kosovo?s highest-level officials.  As the Mission?s senior-level advisor on energy, the Senior Energy Advisor will exercise significant independent judgment on matters of policy and technical direction, and will be required to independently make decisions that ensure successful program implementation.  

The Senior Energy Advisor will also be the Mission?s principal day-to-day liaison with other U.S. Government agencies, in particular the US Office in Pristina, and international organizations and foreign donors engaged in providing assistance in Kosovo?s energy sector.  He/she will report frequently to senior Mission management and will advise senior-level USOP and other senior officials from Department of State, donor, and host government officials on energy policy and reform and USAID support strategy to the energy sector.  He/She will meet regularly with heads of offices, including UNMIK, the World Bank, IMF, the European Agency for Reconstruction and European liaison offices.

The Senior Energy Advisor will serve as the focal point for all USAID assistance relating to the energy sector.  He/She will be responsible for formulating strategies for energy sector reform and development and managing energy activities.  This will include ensuring that the design and implementation of all USAID energy activities are coordinated with the Kosovar government, international organizations, and bilateral and multilateral donors active in the energy sector in Kosovo.

Development of the energy sector is a key element of accomplishing USAID?s strategic objectives in Kosovo including the following:  SO 4.1 Social stabilization achieved through special applications (Commercial viability of KEK improved), SO 1.3 Accelerated growth of the private sector, and SO 1.2 Establishment of an institutional, legal and regulatory framework for economic growth.  

B.	Background

Kosovo has large reserves of high-quality lignite which, if properly managed, can be used to transform Kosovo into a major energy exporter in Europe.  However, 15 years of neglect, under-investment, and poor planning have resulted in a deteriorated energy infrastructure.  
KEK (Korporata Energjetike e Kosov?s) is Kosovo?s vertically integrated electric utility that includes coal mining, generation, transmission and dispatch, network and supply. It is a Publicly-Owned Enterprise administered by the Kosovo Trust Agency under the United Nation Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), EU Pillar IV. 

Despite almost seven years of efforts by both Kosovars and the international community, there remain serious deficiencies in KEK?s ability to deliver electricity.  A primary problem is that KEK does not collect approximately two-thirds of the value of electricity delivered (this includes technical and commercial losses and non-payment of bills).  While this situation has improved somewhat over the past year, the inability of KEK to collect for the electricity produced means that KEK lacks the financial ability to do required maintenance or make other capital investments.  Insufficient revenue generation is widely considered to be the primary cause of KEK?s inability to provide 24-hour electricity.  Additionally, public perception of KEK is very low, with a June 2006 survey revealing that 62% of Kosovars view KEK as having a high level of corruption. 
Thus, to this day, Kosovo experiences significant power outages and use of generators is common.  Because unreliable energy is frequently cited as the primary impediment to business expansion, improving the delivery of electricity is a critical part of USAID?s strategy for accelerating economic growth.  
The Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) is a new ministry, only established in November 2004.  MEM has produced the Energy Strategy for Kosovo 2005-2015 which  emphasizes the need to attract private capital in the development of new mines, construction of new generation capacity, and rehabilitation of existing power plants.   Accordingly, MEM, in partnership with the World Bank, is implementing the Lignite Power Technical Assistance Project (LPTAP) with an objective of attracting private sector investors to develop new mines and generation in Kosovo.  An estimated Euro 2 to 3 billion will be required to develop mines and new generation under LPTAP.  Thus, this will be Kosovo?s largest investment in the near future.  LPTAP will not be successful unless there is improved electricity distribution by KEK.  Thus, a strategy for improving electricity delivery, including a plan for private sector participation in KEK is needed.
The Energy Regulatory Office (ERO) is also a relatively new institution, established in 2004.  While ERO has drafted much of its secondary legislation and operating procedures, it is still nascent and struggling to become an effective regulator.  The Independent Commission for Mines and Minerals is likewise a new institution.

Previous USAID assistance for support of the energy sector has taken a number of forms, including assistance to KEK?s billing and collections department, drafting energy laws, and technical assistance to the new regulator.

During the past two years, the Mission has become increasingly involved in energy issues, to the point where energy issues require substantial time commitments from mission staff, including the Mission Director and the Director of Economic Growth Office.  Currently, USAID/Kosovo provides policy and legal advice to MEM, primarily in support of LPTAP.  In addition, USAID has plans for a new energy project, beginning January 2007, to provide technical assistance to KEK.  While USAID does not currently contemplate additional assistance to the energy sector, that possibility is not ruled out.  In any event, USAID assistance will require involvement with all relevant institutions.
C.	Major Duties and Responsibilities 
As an overarching requirement, the Senior Energy Advisor must understand and analyze all of the complex interdependent pre-conditions, requirements and approaches for development of the energy sector in Kosovo.  The complexity and difficulty of the preconditions and needs cannot be overstated.  The Senior Energy Advisor must possess a broad field of expertise as noted below.  While the potential for developing Kosovo?s lignite is great, the amount of work to be done and the complexity of this work equally large.  On the one hand, the Senior Energy Advisor will be involved in helping to further develop the requisite Kosovar institutions, as well as helping the government develop important national energy policies.  At the same time, the Senior Energy Advisor must also have a firm grasp of what the private sector will require, including a knowledge of such diverse subjects as project finance, law, energy regulatory regimes, technical aspects of electricity delivery (e.g., transmission), tariff issues, and regional as well as local politics affecting energy.  
It will be the task of the Senior Energy Advisor to ensure that USAID assistance is well-placed and well-implemented to support the LPTAP project in going forward as planned, bringing the Euro 2 to 3 billion of private sector investment into Kosovo.  At the same time, the Senior Energy Advisor must help reforms in the entire sector, including radical improvements to electricity distribution.  All of this must occur in an environment, including a regulatory environment, that is supportive of these reforms and the Senior Energy Advisor will be required to monitor and support this progress.  All these tasks will require constant attention and a high-level of expertise.
More specifically, the Senior Energy Advisor's major duties and responsibilities include:
Strategy Development
a)        Providing analysis, advice, and recommendations to senior Mission management and staff regarding the formulation of mission strategy for assistance for development of the energy sector and on the management and implementation of energy activities in the Mission?s portfolio.

b)        Maintaining close contact, providing technical advice, and engaging in policy dialogue as appropriate with staff and senior representatives of host government institutions, international organizations and missions (particularly UNMIK and OSCE), the Kosovar legal community, foreign donors active in the energy sector.
c)        Organizing and attending donor coordination meetings relating to the energy sector.

General Management
a)         Continuously keeping current on developments affecting the energy sector in Kosovo and reporting such developments to mission management and staff.

<RESPDATE>111406
<CONTACT>Marvin Walker  703-432-3317
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is hosting an Industry Day Briefing seeking a potential source as a Systems Integrator for the Marine Assault Climbers Kit (MACK).  The Industry Day briefing is designed to provide a detailed overview of current and future requirements for the MACK.  The briefing will be held at the Eldorado Hotel & Casino in Reno, Nevada from Monday and Tuesday, 20 - 21 November,  2006.  The two day briefings are open to all interested parties.  Registration for the briefing is free and all attendees must register.  Attendance for the briefing is limited to a max of four individuals per company.  A limited number of hotel rooms are blocked at the Eldorado Hotel & Casino hotel in Reno, NV under Group ID# NUSMC11 Marine Corps on a first come basis.  All incurred expenses are the responsibility of the individual attendee.  Individual rooms are listed under the MACK Briefings, Marine Corps.  The MACK is designed to provide Marine Infantry un!  its with the capability to respond to two elements of the National Defense Policy: Forward Presence and Crisis Response.  Additionally, the MACK must meet the National Military Strategy requirement to maximize the combat capability of each service and to provide forces that are capable of respond to crises involving the entire spectrum of conflict from urban to mountainous operations.  The MACK equipment will be lightweight, strong, technologically advanced, safe, provide minimum bulk, ease of use and recovery.  The MACK at a minimum will enable Marines to: 1. Cross a 300-foot vertical danger area, such as a cliff, with the objective of crossing a 400-foot danger area. 2. Support basic mountain operations. 3. Support basic urban operations. 4. Provide modularity to support several spectrums ranging from steep earth, alpine and ice.  After conducting limited Market Research, it has been determined that no one individual company manufactures all necessary equipment to complet!  e a typical MACK mission.  Additionally, real-world seniors, mission p rofile and requirements are continually changing.  As such, unit responsibility, improved technology, coupled with providing Marines with the ability to respond to a particular threat, has required that the MACK undergo numerous modularization and technology upgrades.  To meet such a need, it is the intent of Marine Corps Systems Command to seek a Systems Integrator/Supplier for future procurement and/or maintenance of the MACK.  Information concerning the history, background and the role of the MACK will be provided during the two day information brief and training session to be held at the Mountain Warfare Training Center on Monday, 20 November 2006 at 12:00pm.  The brief and training session are designed so that industry can gain a better understanding of how the Marine Corps operates and trains to meet this specified requirement.  In addition, the two day briefing will afford industry the opportunity to develop partnerships for the procurement of the MACK.  The Marine Co!  rps will procure a minimum 100 kits with a potential of procuring up to a maximum 500 kits.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) is not currently available.  Non attendance at this two day information brief does not preclude individual companies from bidding on any future procurement.  Additional information is posted on our web site at http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/pmice, and then click the Industry Information tab.  The government is not responsible for proprietary information released by companies during the open forum.  To register, contact Marvin Walker via email marvin.walker1@usmc.mil, not later than 2 p.m., 14 November 2006.   The following information shall be provided  for all attendees: Name, Company, Position, Email Address and Phone Number.  Any company representative scheduling more than the maximum allowable representatives will be rejected.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVER!  NMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR  THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

This is a sources sought synopsis.  This is not a Request for Proposals.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is conducting a market survey and analysis to determine the range of commercial and public entities available to provide the NRC with the services  described below and to assess their capabilities.  The purpose of this request for information is to provide potential sources the opportunity to submit information regarding their capabilities to perform work for the NRC free of conflict of interest (COI).  For information on NRC COI regulations, visit NRC Acquisition Regulation Subpart 2009.5 (www.nrc.gov/who-we-are/contracting/48cfr-ch20.html ).  All interested parties, including small business/small disadvantaged businesses and other Federal entities, are invited to submit a response to the market research questions below.  Submission of additional materials such as glossy brochures, CDs, or videos is discouraged.  Responses are due no later than September nn, 2006.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the requested information.  Telephone inquiries or responses are not acceptable.  Facsimile (301-415-nnnn) or email (amr2@nrc.gov with copy to acr@nrc.gov) responses are acceptable or responses may be mailed to: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Attn: Adelis Rodriquez, Division of Contracts, MS T-7 I-2, Washington, DC 20555.  

INTRODUCTION.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is an independent regulatory agency tasked with the mission to regulate and license the Nation=s civilian use of byproduct, source, and special nuclear materials to ensure adequate protection of public health and safety, promote the common defense and security, and protect the environment.  The NRC=s enacted budget authority for Fiscal Year (FY) 2006 was $742 million and 3,294 FTEs.  The NRC collects approximately 90% of its budget, less the portion funded from the Nuclear Waste Fund and other designated exceptions, in annual and service fees charged to NRC licensees.  Total estimated fee collections in FY 2006 are anticipated to be approximately $625 million.  The NRC budget and staffing levels are anticipated to grow in the next few years due to the expected growth in new reactor license applications.  The NRC=s Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) is responsible for the financial stewardship of the NRC including the management of financial systems used in the course of official financial business.  

BACKGROUND.  The NRC currently uses a Federal shared service provider (SSP) as the information technology (IT) host and provider of the NRC=s core financial system, the Federal Financial System (FFS).  This SSP has over 30 years experience successfully servicing administrative systems for over 150 Federal government agencies.  FFS is the centerpiece of the NRC financial systems architecture.  FFS is a mainframe-based legacy system that the NRC implemented in October 1992 to perform the core financial function for the NRC.  Although implemented by the NRC in 1992, FFS was developed more than 20 years ago and is now nearing the end of its extended life cycle.  In addition to FFS, the same Federal SSP currently hosts the NRC payroll and human resources system and the NRC e-Travel System.  Moreover, the supporting infrastructure including communications links, interfaces, continuity planning,  and security are well-established and shared by these applications. 

 
The Federal SSP notified all customer agencies in a March 30, 2006, letter, that the corporate owner of FFS, CGI-AMS, has advised the SSP that FFS is no longer compliant with Federal standards for financial management systems and that they have discontinued any upgrades or enhancements to this system.  Therefore, the SSP further advised that they will no longer provide services on FFS effective with the beginning of FY 2011, starting on October 1, 2010.  As a result, the NRC must replace its legacy core financial system, FFS, with a modern solution.  The NRC is planning to target an implementation date of October 1, 2009.  Thus, the NRC is conducting market research to survey the availability of capable hosts, from the commercial and public sectors, of financial systems applications and the specific core financial applications they offer.  We are also researching the capability of these same hosts to host Federal payroll, time and labor (T&L), human resources, eTravel, and acquisition/ procurement systems.
 
The chart in Exhibit A lists the current NRC inventory of financial systems.  The systems are operational unless otherwise noted as under development.  All of the systems listed in Exhibit A have a direct or indirect interface with the FFS and would be interfaced with a new core financial system or may be subsumed by the functionality of the new core.  

REQUIREMENTS.  The NRC is seeking information from entities on their capability to provide the following products: (a) core financial system software; (b) payroll system software for Federal payroll and benefits; ( c ) human resources software for Federal human resources processing; (d) eTravel software for Federal travel; and, for possible future implementation, (e) the NRC is seeking information on the entity=s capability to provide acquisition/ procurement system software fully integrated with the core financial system.  In addition, the NRC is seeking information from entities on their capability to provide the following services: (a) financial systems software implementation and integration services; (b) hosting services for all of the financial systems products listed above at the entity=s facility on appropriate hardware (the electronic hardware environment) that is operated, maintained and upgraded when necessary by the host entity (not NRC); and, ( c) hosting services for NRC-provided time and labor (T&L) software.  The NRC is seeking information from a single entity and single NRC contact that can provide all of the software and services listed above with a seamless, transparent interface for the NRC and its user community.

The NRC seeks a viable replacement of the FFS with a modern, web-based, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) core financial system.  The system must be certified by the Federal Systems Integration Office (FSIO) as compliant with all current Federal core financial system requirements and security standards.  The system must have proven years of full implementation in service at a Federal agency of at least the (budgetary/FTE) size of the NRC, or larger.  The NRC has determined that two core products currently meet this criteria and limits the request for information to those entities that can provide either: (1) CGI-AMS= Momentum and/or, (2) Oracle Federal Financials.

The NRC seeks information from providers of IT hosting services capable of hosting one or both of these core financial system products.  Initially, the NRC also seeks to have the same hosting entity for Federal payroll, human resources, and eTravel.  Subsequently, the NRC seeks to have the same hosting entity for acquisition/procurement system and, time and labor (T&L).  The NRC seeks to establish a seamless architecture across financial systems by keeping financial systems hosted under a single provider to the extent possible.  The NRC seeks to avoid duplicate infrastructure costs for multiple hosts and reduce cost by foregoing the need to build multiple, remote interfaces among separate providers.  It will also eliminate the need for NRC to manage multiple hosting entities.

 
The NRC seeks information on a host entity=s capabilities and experience to implement and integrate new financial systems, interface with other financial systems, and convert historical data.  NRC also anticipates the functionality contained in a modern core financial system product may subsume the functionality of some currently separate existing financial systems, thereby allowing the retirement of some as separate system(s).  The NRC seeks information on a host contractor=s capability to provide services to analyze agency business processes and provide recommendations where efficiencies can be achieved as they relate to implementation of a new core financial system. 

With financial systems, the NRC embraces the integrated architectural concept expressed by the Federal Financial Management System Requirements (FFMSR) Model in the Core Financial System Requirements publication.  From an architectural standpoint, the NRC wants to achieve a seamless and uniformly managed integration across all agency financial systems.  We also want seamless access and uninterrupted availability of financial data to our end users including managers.  We want to take advantage of an efficient architecture to improve our management of NRC resources by improving the delivery and timeliness of financial information to end users including managers.  Improvement of financial information to end users, along with expanding the types of financial system user (e.g., direct input by project managers, etc.) is a key goal.  We anticipate an expanded internal user base across all systems to be more than 3,000 users at various levels.

The NRC is seeking information on the security applicable to a host contractor=s facility and its compliance with all current Federal security standards and whether there is a well-designed, robust business continuity plan.   Additionally, the NRC seeks information from providers of IT hosting services of whether they have achieved full certification and accreditation (C&A) by a Federal agency and have authority to operate (ATO) a core financial and/or other financial system(s) for a Federal agency.  Finally, the NRC is seeking information concerning an independent auditor=s review of operating controls in place in your processing environment in accordance with Statement of Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 70 and the opinion expressed in the resultant report.

<DESC>The Bureau of Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Access Board, is assessing the market to gain information about the procurement of a telephone services system to include a voice-over-internet protocol for the Washington, DC office.  This notice is not a solicitation, but an inquiry regarding the capabilities of telephone systems providers and a request for information from offerors who are willing and capable of providing a presentation regarding telephone system capabilities.  We are seeking information from, and will invite, potential vendors for presentations to be conducted at the Access Board based upon the responses we receive from this Request for Information.

Access Board Background
The Access Board is an independent Federal agency devoted to accessibility for people with disabilities. Created in 1973 to ensure access to federally funded facilities, the Access Board is now a leading source of information on accessible design. The Access Board develops and maintains design criteria for the built environment, transit vehicles, telecommunications equipment, and for electronic and information technology. It also provides technical assistance and training on these requirements and on accessible design and continues to enforce accessibility standards that cover federally funded facilities.

The Board is structured to function as a coordinating body among Federal agencies and to directly represent the public, particularly people with disabilities. Half of its members are representatives from most of the Federal departments. The other half is comprised of members of the public appointed by the President, a majority of who must have a disability.  The Board has a staff of about 30 people, and offices in commercial space in downtown Washington, DC.  As part of its legislative mandate, the Board sets the requirements for which electronic and information technology purchased by the Federal government must meet under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Any new phone system must comply with all the applicable requirements Section 508.  These requirements can be located at www.access-board.gov/508.htm. 

Telephone System Requirements
The Access Board is investigating the purchase of a new state-of-the-art telephone system.  The Access Board believes that the new system should feature voice-over-the-internet-protocol, but is willing to consider other options.  The Board is seeking an integrated telephone system, which includes unified messaging, TTY capabilities, including support for Voice Carry Over(VCO)/Hearing Carry Over(HCO) users.  In addition, an accessible integrated telephone system would provide universal access to all telephone functions and information (e.g., caller ID, directory of extensions, ability to mark a message urgent, call status, number of calls in queue, do not disturb, call-forward and other configurations.) The Access Board requires a vendor that can provide managed life cycle support for the Access Board?s telephone system infrastructure.

Current Access Board System Infrastructure
The Board currently operates and maintains a Siemens HICOM 150 H Office PRO with Xpression Unified Messaging. The switch interface type is BRI with 4 ports. The Board estimates a maximum of 40 desktop systems will be maintained under the potential resultant contract.

Requirements for Request for Information Response
Vendors interested in providing the Access Board with information for an appropriate telephone system should plan to present their product(s), capabilities and potential solutions in a product demonstration to the Access Board staff.  The product demonstrations will be conducted as follows:
?	The demonstration will be made at the Access Board?s office at 1331 F St. NW, Suite 1000, Washington DC and will not exceed two hours in length. Demonstrations may be scheduled between November 27, 2006 and 
December 8, 2006.  No extensions of this time period will be accepted.
?	The vendor will bring all necessary equipment for its demonstration.  The Access Board will provide a projection screen.
?	There will be 7 to 8 Access Board staff members attending the demonstrations.  The vendor should not have more than 5 staff attending.
?	Vendors must demonstrate how their products comply with the appropriate parts of the Section 508 requirements. 

Vendors must submit a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) in advance of their appointment.  Appointments will be set only after a review of the responses to this RFI for only those most clearly capable of meeting the needs of the Access Board.  The VPAT can be posted on the vendor?s website with a link provided to the Access Board or the VPAT can be attached to an email sent in response to this RFI to ntprocurement@bpd.treas.gov. The VPAT will detail the specific Section 508 provisions applicable to the product and describe the product features, which evidence conformance with those requirements.  Further information on VPATs can be found at www.buyaccessible.gov.

For the requirements of this RFI please also submit the following information: 

1.	A narrative statement no longer than three (3) pages, which highlights successful experience with operating environments of similar size and scope as the required services.
2.	A statement of your business type, including size, GSA schedule number information (if applicable), and references (at least three including agency name, point of contact and phone number).

Your response should be sent to ntprocurement@bpd.treas.gov no later than close of business on November 14, 2006.  In your response, please reference RFI-ABA-07-0001 in the subject line.  Please notice that this information is being requested for information and planning purposes only.  This notice is not a solicitation.

<SUBJECT>--Request for Information for Next Generation Diagnostics (Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System Block III) Roadmap Study Investigation 2006
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI).  The Chemical Biological Medical Systems (CBMS) Joint Project Management Office, under the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD), is issuing a request for information (R FI) to survey available and/or emerging technologies that may be incorporated into a military pathogen identification and diagnostic system to meet the needs of all U.S. DoD military services.  This RFI is specifically seeking information on technologies t hat will support delivery of the Next Generation Diagnostics Joint Biological Agent Identification and Diagnostic System (JBAIDS), previously referred as JBAIDS Block III.  Information gathered in response to this RFI will be used to support the Medical Identification and Treatment Systems (MITS)-JBAIDS program office in strategic planning for development of a Next Generation Diagnostics JBAIDS acquisition strategy.  The Block I JBAIDS has successfully been developed to meet Joint Service requirements wit h fielding initiated in 2005.  Block I is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based system that includes assays for 16 targets representing 14 different biological warfare (BW) pathogens; JBAIDS assays have demonstrated greater than 95% sensitivity at the 90 % confidence level in a variety of both environmental and clinical matrices with specificity greater than 90% against genetic near neighbors.  The Next Generation Diagnostics JBAIDS is envisioned to employ, in a system-of-systems design approach, a combina tion of nucleic acid detection and non-nucleic acid detection (not limited to conventional methods), supplemented by an automated (or semi-automated) sample preparation component.  This next generation system will be modular in design and will likely depen d on a fusion of protein (or other molecular target) and nucleic acid detection results; ideas or technologies addressing this approach are solicited.  This RFI seeks submissions that will provide contributions to any or all of the following components of the next generation system: nucleic acid detection, non-nucleic acid detection (proteins/other molecular targets), automated sample preparation, data-fusion, and a communication subsystem module to allow system connectivity to DoD medical/ information repo rting systems and into the DoD Global Information Grid (GIG).  Responders are encouraged to clearly specify which modular subsystem component(s) will be addressed in their technology submissions.  A detailed system specification is beyond the scope of this  RFI and only the fundamental technology needs will be highlighted within this document.  The desired system-of-systems will perform simultaneous orthogonal identification of multiple pathogens and toxins in both clinical and environmental samples with spe cificity of greater than or equal to 95% and achieve levels of threat agent identification (sensitivity) with high fidelity and statistically supported confidence.  Capability is desired to test both clinical specimens and environmental samples for a broad  spectrum (e.g. up to 50) of agents and pathogens.  An evolutionary development and fielding approach is envisioned with the initial fielded  Next Generation Diagnostics JBAIDS being capable of meeting or exceeding the capabilities of the JBAIDS Block I sy stem described above and adding capability to identify a minimum of 5 toxins in both environmental and clinical samples.  The envisioned next generation system will require little or no ancillary sample prep support equipment.  Manufacturing of this system  and associated assay kits, if required, must be cGMP compliant as the Next Generation Diagnostics JBAIDS will be required to obtain FDA approval as a clinical diagnostic device.  After initial fielding, the Next Generation Diagnostics JBAIDS capability wi ll be incrementally increased by adding additional BW agents and toxin identification capabilities.  Minimal logistics and personnel support is desired for oper ation of the Next Generation Diagnostics JBAIDS.  Capability of the system to operate using reagent-less systems, or minimal or no fluidics, is highly desirable.  Sample preparation, if required, must be automated and integrated within the system.  The sys tem must be able to be successfully operated by personnel with limited training and technical skill sets. The final design must be small (objective: 20 lbs or less, briefcase size or smaller), easily transportable, and ruggedized).  The Next Generation Dia gnostics JBAIDS must have onboard software that is capable of device operation, output analysis, and information transfer using conventional methods (such as ethernet or serial communication) which can interface with existing DoD medical/information report ing systems and the DoD GIG.  The envisioned operational use is far forward in the battle space.  In contrast to prior RFIs and solicitations from the MITS-JBAIDS program office, this RFI is not necessarily targeted at commercial off-the-shelf systems.  Co mpanies with technologies/systems/subsystems under development in the prototype/brassboard stage are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  Early developmental efforts will be considered.  Additionally, companies that have developed technologies/subsystems th at can serve as partial solutions to an integrated JBAIDS next generation platform are also encouraged to respond to this RFI.  The desired development time frame would be for the subsystem to achieve a technology readiness level (TRL) of 4-5 or higher to support a Government acquisition concept refinement effort (Milestone A) into a functional brassboard device in 2 years (2008).  However, information on the level of development achievable at both the 2-year and 5-year time frame is desired.  JPEO-CBD defi nitions for TRLs are available upon request by contacting the MITS-JBAIDS program office as noted below.  The following information is requested from prospective companies electing to respond to this RFI: 1) Notification in writing to the Government  comp any POC and  address; 2) a written statement (3-5 pages maximum) describing the company's ability to provide a Next Generation Diagnostics JBAIDS subsystem or subsystems (nucleic acid detection, protein detection, sample preparation, data-fusion, and commu nication module).  Companies interested in this RFI are also asked to use a quad chart (available upon request) as a summary template for initial responses back to the Government.  Companies are encouraged to additionally provide brief technology developme ntal plans for how their proposed Next Generation Diagnostics JBAIDS subsystem will be matured over the next 2-4 years to include making their proposed subsystems smaller in physical size.  Also, the Government is interested in any companys strategic part nerships or cooperative research and developmental areas the candidate technology may leverage in the developmental process.  The Government may request meetings with the candidates to provide more in-depth technical briefings as necessary to complete the survey.  Responses to this RFI will be accepted for review if received by 30 November 2006 by 4:00PM EST.  Responding companies also need to state that their company is eligible to receive a DoD Secret-Level Clearance.  Companies desiring to participate in  this RFI notice effort should contact Dr. James Karaszkiewicz for a copy of the JPEO-CBD Assigning Technology Readiness Levels reference document and the summary quad chart.  Dr. Karaszkiewiczs e-mail address is James.Karaszkiewicz@det.amedd.army.mil in Frederick MD, phone: 301-619-8430; and mailing address: JPM CBMS, Attn: SFAE-CBD-CBMS-MITS/Dr. James Karaszkiewicz, 64 Thomas Johnson Dr., Frederick MD 21702.  The CBMS-MITS-JBAIDS referenced material will be e-mailed to requesting companies.  This notice is being released by the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Attn: Susan Dell (Susan.Dell@det.amedd.army.mil), Contract Specialist, 64 Thomas Johnson Dri ve, Frederick MD 21702.  Written responses to this RFI notice must be forwarded to Ms. Dell and Dr. Karaszkiewicz via e-mail and hardcopy to the above mentioned mailing addresses.  The Government makes no future guarantees of a request for proposal release  on a Next Generation Diagnostics JBAIDS (Block III) development effort.  The above technical material responses from companies will be used in developing a DoD BW medical diagnostic equipment roadmap for future DoD investment strategies.  This RFI is issu ed solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or issuance thereof.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to this RFI will not be re turned.  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared under the authority of Part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The Executive Office for United States of Attorney?s (EOUSA) invites contractors to submit a proposal for Acquisition Support Services. This Request for Proposal (RFP) in no way obligates the U.S. Government to award a contract, nor does it commit the U.S. Government to pay any cost incurred in preparing and submitting your proposal. The selection process will consist of a Best Value source selection based on organizational past performance, organizational experience, key personnel and price.  Under a Best Value source selection, non-price evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.  However, EOUSA will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.  In order to select the winning proposal, EOUSA will rank each offeror by making a series of paired comparisons between them, trading off the marginal differences in capability with the marginal difference in price. The actual period of performance will be determined at the time of award; however we anticipate awarding a one year contract with one option year. 
THIS SOLICITATION IS SET ASSIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS and the NAICS code is 541611.

STATEMENT OF WORK
DARPA 50th Anniversary Display
October 20th, 2007

1.0  SUMMARY 

The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) seeks to obtain a contractor to develop and produce a display that showcases DARPA?s 50th Anniversary. This exhibit will be displayed at the DARPATech Conference at the Anaheim Marriott in Anaheim, CA August 6- 9, 2007. DARPATech is conducted approximately every 18 months to inform the private industry, the academic community, and the military services of the DARPA mission. The last DARPATech was held in August 2005 and is described at http://www.darpa.mil/DARPATech2005/index.html . 

The 50th Anniversary display will occupy approximately 10ft(width) x 60ft (length) x 15ft(height) of exhibit hall space (See attached floor plan). There may also be separate pedestals or stand alone items that will need to be developed and set up for additional content/displays throughout the lobby and exhibit halls of the Marriott.  The objective is to create a standalone display that will provide a centerpiece to the DARPATech 07 exhibits and communicate DARPA's technical achievements since 1958.  

As an option, the contractor may be asked to recreate the display at the 50th Anniversary Conference and Dinner at the Washington DC Hilton on 10 April 2008.

For the performance of the requirements specified in this Statement of Work, DARPA will identify as a minimum a 50th Anniversary Display Coordinator and planning staff.   These personnel will perform the following duties:

Provide a comprehensive list of content elements and assist the contractor in understanding the nature and context of specific content in DARPA's history.
Obtain public release approval for all content.  (Department of Defense regulations require material scheduled for public release undergo a security review.  DARPA has processes in place to conduct such a review).  Provide government recommendations/approvals to the contractor promptly in all cases where the contract calls for technical approval.

2.0  TASKS

applicable; and the period for acceptance of the offer (minimum of 30 days required).

"late" and will be handled by the Government as indicated by FAR 52.212-1.

7. Communications. The Government intends to evaluate all offers received and award without discussions. However, in order to support evaluations and selection, the Government may choose to obtain proposal clarifications and / or hold discussions, with one or more of the offerors.

(E) SUBCONTRACTING & TEAMING ARRANGEMENTS - Subcontracting and
Contractor Team arrangements are permissible in response to the RFQ. The following guidance applies regardless of any arrangements made between the prime and subcontractors:
?	All proposal submissions must come under the Prime Contractor
?	The Prime Contractor will, at all times, be solely responsible for performance and
	adherence to the standards in the task order
?	The Prime Contractor is responsible for compliance with DARPA?s operating
	procedures, including ODC qualifications, travel approval and submission of 	backup
?	materials, and adherence to quality standards; and
?	Only the Prime Contractor will have any privity of contractual arrangement (e.g., access to DARPA staff).
Proposed arrangements with subcontractors must be clearly identified in proposals to the Government. Identification must include the scope of the work to be performed as well as the method of inclusion (i.e. labor category and rates or other direct cost (ODC)). If a task order is awarded to a contractor who proposed a non-schedule subcontractor as an ODC, that subcontracting arrangement is not subject to the GSA Industrial Funding Fee (IFF). Typically, ODC labor is capped at five percent (5%) of total task order labor value unless other, specific conditions are met and called out in the RFQ language. While there are many variations of team arrangements, DARPA adheres to the traditional "prime contractor-subcontractor" interpretation. At all times, the Prime Contractor is responsible for performance and management, regardless of team size, makeup, or flow-down subcontracting agreements.

(F) RFQ EVALUATION CRITERIA - The government will make a single award
resulting from this RFQ to the responsible Offeror whose conforming business and technical offer is considered most advantageous to the government. In order to support evaluations and selection, the Government may choose to obtain proposal clarifications and/or hold discussions, at its discretion, with one or more of the offerors. The Government will evaluate offers based on the following criteria listed below:

1.  The overall approach in supporting the development and production of an exhibit showcasing DARPA's 50th Anniversary.  

2.  Past performance that shows experience in developing and producing conference displays and exhibits (evidenced by samples of prior work) and an ability to manage time and cost sensitive tasks.

3.  The quality and availability of the Contractor's Key Personnel as evidenced by prior corporate experience related to the proposed tasks.  

4.  Cost realism and Reasonableness.  

Relative order of importance for the evaluation factors is as follows:
a and b-Equal and more important than c
c -More important than d

As a competitive "best value" solicitation, the Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest bidder, at its discretion.

(G) AWARD ? Contractors will be notified by email regarding the disposition of their proposals. These notifications will be issued at the time the CO issues the contract to the selected Contractor.

(H) QUESTIONS - Questions regarding this RFQ and requests for Layout of the Marquis Ballroom shall be directed only to
50thDisplayFabrication@darpa.mil.

<DESC>Question 1: The solicitation states that you would like this to be installed on/over wood frame posts; we can only provide metal frame structure. Do you think we can still bid this with a metal frame or are you specifically seeking the wood frames? Answer: We do understand there could be metals rods used to create the canopy frame, but anything from the ground to canopy should be wood, as this is being installed on a wood deck.
