<ARCHDATE>11302002
<CONTACT>Charles S. (Steve) Brown, 202-267-7651 or 7817
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Integrated Product Team (IPT) for En Route Surveillance is investigating procurement alternatives for up to three (3) follow-on Non-Developmental Item(s) (NDIs), which allow simultaneous, independent Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) approaches at airports with closely spaced parallel runways less than 4,300ft apart.  This technology would provide high update surveillance for approaching aircraft on closely spaced parallel runways. Similar systems exist at five operational sites/airports.  A sixth system is currently in production. <P> Follow-on systems will support standardization of the Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) program in terms of configuration, maintenance and training concept capabilities more practical for support of fielded, in-production and future systems.  This high update surveillance technology “PRM-like” is intended for use in terminal air traffic control environments during Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) weather to mitigate reduced airport approach operations.   <P> The technology/follow-on system(s) must be National Airspace System (NAS) certified and available for system commissioning planned for FY05.  The intention of this survey is to assess the current/near term availability of NDI/PRM-like high update surveillance technologies.  Manufacturers producing “PRM-like” technology/systems that are interested in assisting the Product Team in this effort are invited to provide detailed information regarding their existing system(s).  As a minimum, this information should be specific as to how your system(s) shall satisfy all of the operational requirements discussed below. Please note, however, that participants should refrain from providing any information that is considered proprietary.   <P> If more than one NDI/PRM-like high update surveillance technology is available from a company, please submit separate responses for each. <P> Responses to this survey can be submitted to: DOT/Federal Aviation Administration 800 Independence Avenue, SW Washington, D. C. 20591 Attention: Steve Brown, Contracting Officer, ASU-320, Room 508 C/O: Gavin Byrne, ASU-320 Support, Room 508 <P> Responses should be submitted as to be received by this office by October 31, 2002.  The FAA will not pay for any cost relating to the response to this survey						 OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS 		 OPERATIONAL CONCEPT <P> The high update surveillance system shall generate and display aircraft track data to assist in the monitoring of aircraft making independent landing approaches in instrumented meteorological conditions to parallel runway configurations.  The system will detect aircraft throughout its 360-degree coverage area and provide automatic tracking of the aircraft in operator selected regions, nominally the parallel runway landing sector and missed approach sector.  During the landing phase, the system will acquire the aircraft as they enter the monitored airspace and turn onto the Instrument Landing System (ILS) final approach course.  The system will then automatically track the aircraft until the aircraft lands or conducts a missed approach procedure.  If during the entire landing sequence, one or more aircraft deviates ("blunders") towards the adjacent approach course, the system will automatically detect this deviation and issue an alert to the controller so that the controller ! may take appropriate action.

<DESC>NA There are several questions yet to be answered that Industry has asked.  During this week as I get them they will be posted.  Below is the Question and Answer to a question posed by Industry. Question: The draft RFP for the solicitation above indicates on page 97 that the DBMS software must be Oracle 9i Release 2, Informix Dynamic Server 9.3, or MS Access.  Would the Government entertain a proposal that would include the Sybase ASE v12.5 enterprise class data base?  ASE can coexist AND work closely with the other major database servers on the market. Answer: The CHS-3 concept is to provide CHS-3 system configurations, which are defined as integrated combinations of CHS-3 items needed to satisfy specific operational and maintenance requirements of the Battlefield Functional Areas(BFAs). As of this time, no BFA system developer currently using CHS-2 has identified their need to us to acquire and utilize the Sybase DBMS as part of the CHS-3 system.  Until an appropriate BFA developer identifies and justifies this need to us, we do not inten d to include the requirement for the Sybase DBMS as part of this procurement.

<DESC>NA The Propulsion Technology Function, Propulsion and Structures Directorate (P&SD), U. S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is requesting proposals for the development and demonstration of multiple diesel and hy brid diesel electric propulsion systems for Small Unit Air Vehicle (SUAV) systems in support of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Tactical Technology Office.  SUAVs include Organic Air Vehicle (OAV) and Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) systems.  For the purpose of this solicitation, SUAVs are defined as low cost, small, robust, autonomous, ducted fan air vehicle systems capable of vertical takeoff, hover, transition to high speed cruise flight, and vertical landing.  Program Scope and Funding: Mu ltiple awards are anticipated during the first quarter FY 03 and may be staggered.  The Basic program is structured with two parallel (one for each development effort) 9-month propulsion system development efforts, followed by an Option not to exceed 12 ad ditional months beyond the basic period.  Each offeror may submit a proposal for one or both of the desired propulsion system development efforts; however each development effort (cycle type) must be priced both separately and in combination.  Both the Bas ic and the Option programs must be priced separately for each effort proposed.  All resulting awards under this BAA will contain a requirement for a design review to be held at Propulsion and Structures Directorate, Redstone Arsenal, AL four months after i nitial award which may result in contract modifications.  Following completion of the Basic program, the contractor shall deliver to the P&SD a mathematical model of their propulsion system in source and executable code (cycle deck) along with their final report.  Following completion of the option, the contractor shall deliver to the P&SD (1) an updated mathematical model of their propulsion system in source and executable code (cycle deck) along with their final report and (2) at least one (two desired) i ntegrated propulsion systems along with any Special Test Equipment (STE), control systems, and spare parts required for Government conducted evaluation/qualification testing.  Propulsion systems shall be accepted for product improvement testing during the Basic program if available.  All propulsion systems delivered under the Basic effort may be returned as-is post testing.  With respect to data related to the propulsion mathematical model (both source and executable) and documentation needed for users to b e able to perform trade studies, make modifications as needed and incorporate into Air Vehicle Prediction Codes, the Government shall receive Unlimited Rights.  Information on the propulsion model and format required can be obtained by contacting the contr act specialist, Marcia Tully by phone:  (256) 842-7406 or e-mail:  marcia.tully@redstone.army.mil.  P&SD estimates approximately $0.3M to $0.4M for each Basic propulsion system effort and $2.1M - $2.2M for each Option effort.  Note that the propulsion mode l will be a CDRL item and we will ensure it is in their SOW.  Program Objectives: P&SD is soliciting proposals for the development and demonstration of two propulsion systems of interest.  1. The first system is a 2.7 hp, 2 stroke, 2 cylinder diesel engine  with a built in starter generator system.  2. The second system is an approximately 7.8 hp, 2 stroke, 6 cylinder diesel engine with a built in starter generator system.  Proposals should consider the complete propulsion system, including remote start capa bility and Thermal Electric Generators (TEG), which were developed and funded under the DARPA MAV technology program.  Information on the TEG program can be obtained by contacting the contract specialist, Marcia Tully by phone:  (256) 842-7406 or e-mail: marcia.tully@redstone.army.mil.  Technical Requirements ? Key Terms.  Definitions of key terms are as follows:  Measured Horsepower: uninstalled sustainable hor sepower at the drive shaft as measured on a suitable test bench (e.g. dynamometer). Rated Power: maximum power that can be sustained for 5 minutes at Sea Level (SL) Standard Day (SD) conditions.  Maximum Continuous Power (MCP): maximum power that can be sustained for one hour or more, at SL SD.  Cruise Power: the power setting that yields  the best Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) @ SL SD.  Engine Weight: the weight of all the components necessary for a starting and self-sustaining engine, capable of maintaining demonstrated horsepower, ready for installation into an airframe, not including prop, and ground support equipment.  Mission Cycle: is comprised of an engine start, run for 60 minutes without engine failure, engine stop, and cooling to ambient temperature.  Engine Start: the process of transitioning the engine from a state of no movem ent at ambient temperature to running under its own power, including spinning, and/or turning the engine over (heating is excluded).  Non-starters: those engines where engine start takes longer than 45 seconds, once the engine starter has been engaged.  En gine Failure: the inability to maintain 90% demonstrated horsepower.  Power to Weight Ratio: the ratio of measured maximum continuous horsepower to engine weight.  Engine Life: the number of mission cycles that can be accomplished before engine failure.  Fuel Efficiency: the efficiency of the engine as represented by specifi c fuel consumption (lbm/hp_hr).  Thrust-to-Weight Ratio: the ratio of total measured thrust available for flight propulsion from the engine and the electric motor, to the weight of the flight ready power pack.  This includes the complete engine, motor/gene rator, power electronics, propeller, controls and any weight penalty for noise control.  The weight of batteries and fuel tank shall not be included.  Desired thrust-to-weight ratio of 2:1 or greater.  Generator Power: the maximum continuous electrical out put of the generator, rated at the speed corresponding to the engine's maximum continuous power rating.  Motor Power: the maximum continuous power rating of the propulsion motor at the system voltage.  Engine Life: the number of mission cycles that can be accomplished before engine failure.  Design life shall be specified at the population's 10% failure rate.  Inability to produce 90% of the maximum continuous power rating will constitute engine failure.  Engine Specific Fuel Consumption: the fuel usage of the engine when operating at a MCP, specified in units of lbm/HP-hr.  Generator Efficiency: the ratio of generator electrical output to mechanical power input at a specified speed.  Power System Efficiency: electrical output power vs. fuel usage of at a gi ven output power rating.  Engine Non-Starts: the percentage of engines that are non-starters. (i.e. power plant is not started by remote control in SD conditions with 45 seconds of starter engagement.).Submission Process - Potential offerors are invited to  submit proposals on this BAA to the Contracting Officer no later than 45 days from the date of this notice, 11:00 A.M.

Cost sharing is encouraged and any cost share must be separately identified in the proposal.  Proposals must: (1) Provide a description of the proposed technology/concept, the technical challenges that must be me t in order to achieve the projected performance and the underlying theory/principles supporting the expected level of performance;  (2) Define the development process that is proposed to advance the technology and to transition the technology into a flight  worthy component that provides the required level of performance; (3) Provide a statement of work, schedule, list of deliverables and costs for the proposed program; (4) Specify tests that should be used to benchmark overall performance of the components;  (5) Identify offerors and team members' facilities and equipment that will support the effort; (6) Identify any government-furnished facilities, equipment and/or information that are needed to support the effort; (8) Describe the team members and their qu alifications for the proposed effort and their demonstrated record of achievement.  Other Information - The provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 9.5 (Organizational Conflict of Interest) apply in an award under this BAA.  Accordingly, a potential offeror is cautioned to review it?s contract and subcontract history, and before incurring s ubstantial proposal preparation expense, to determine whether or not in its judgment a real or potential conflict of interest does or might exist that will prevent the contracting officer from considering its proposal, or making an award under this BAA.  Q uestionable circumstances or situations should be addre ssed to the contracting officer for BAA DAAH01-02-R-RB03 by e-mail for resolution and decision as soon as possible. Offerors are also cautioned that (1) the absence of any communication between offerors and the contracting officer on these matters (real or  potential conflict of interest) shall not preclude the contracting officer from conducting his or her own research and analysis, and arriving at his or her own determination relative to the existence of real or potential conflicts of interest, and (2) in the event of a determination of a conflict of interest, the government shall not be liable for the cost of proposal preparation and submission.  The Government anticipates making multiple awards.  Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the government to pa y any proposal preparation costs.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the Army.  Offerors should recommend acquisition streamlining where appropriate.  Teaming is encourage d, e.g., industry and U.S. Universities.  Participation by Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) is strongly encouraged as either a contractor or subcontractor although, due to the impracticality of reserving di screte or severable tasks, no portion of this BAA will be set aside. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement as authorized by 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) which provides for competitive selection of basic research pr oposals. There will be no further solicitations regarding this announcement, however potential offerors should monitor the FedBiz for potential changes to this announcement.  The government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Participation in this procurement by foreign vendors is allowed and encouraged, however foreign vendors must understand that access to some data, either furnished by the government or generated thro ugh contract performance may require a U. S. issued facility clearance, therefore teaming with a U. S.  company holding U. S. Facility clearance may be required.  These efforts are designated as unclassified.  Evaluation and Award - Proposals will not be e valuated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.  The evaluation criteria consist of two areas:  technical/management and cost.  The technical/management is significantly more important than cost.  The te chnical/ management evaluation criteria consists of four elements.  Elements (1) and (2) are weighted equally and each, individually, is slightly more important than elements (3) and (4), individually, which are also weighted equally.  Specific criteria in clude:    1) overall scientific merit in relationship to the soundness and innovativeness of the technical approach; 2) offeror's ability to implement the proposed program as demonstrated by availability of qualified personnel, equipment and facilities, an d expertise relevant to the proposed propulsion technologies; 3) potential utility, effectiveness, and exit level of maturity of the proposed technology for SUAVs, 4) the offeror's commitment to transfer the technology to OAV system integrator and/or the M AV ACTD developer, and the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed contract are to be delivered to P&SD and DARPA with unrestricted rights; and 5) proposed cost and cost realism.  Evaluation and selection of pro posal(s) for award will be made on the basis of initial offers received, the criteria listed above, and on overall balance considered most advantageous to the DARPA MAV Program. Awards are subject to availability of Government funds.  Not all proposals dee med selectable will be funded. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  Awards made under this BAA a re subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest.  All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through  an active contract or subcontract.  All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmation should be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or pote ntial existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in the FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  The disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate suc h conflict.  It is the policy of P&SD and DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information, and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation. P&SD and DARPA reserve the right to use technical expertise from both Government and non-G overnment sources to provide advice during the evaluation process. Program SETA support will be used in an advisory role due to their extensive knowledge and expertise with the program.  Selections under this BAA will be made only by Government evaluators.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-PRDA-01-07-IFKPA

<DESC>William Baldygo, Laboratory Program Manager, 315-330-4049,  (William.Baldygo@afrl.af.mil) and Joetta A. Bernhard, Contracting Officer, 315-330-2308; (Joetta.Bernhard@rl.af.mil).   The AFRL Sensors Directorate at the Rome Research Site, as DARPA/SPO's technical and program execution agent, is soliciting white papers for innovative knowledge-aided sensor signal processing approaches to improve the performance of current and future Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors.  This is a four-year open-ended Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) to solicit research and development white papers for the DARPA/AFRL Knowledge-Aided Sensor Signal Processing and Expert Reasoning (KASSPER) program. 
When operating in complex clutter environments potentially encountered in modern military applications, current Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor performance may fall significantly short of expectations based on typical benign test environments. These operational environs typically contain one of more of the following effects: 
(1) Complex heterogeneous clutter; (2) Dense target backgrounds (military and/or civilian); (3) Urban and littoral clutter plus other large clutter discretes; (4) Nonstationary clutter loci arising from bistatic, multistatic and other advanced applications and concepts.  Current and planned ISR architectures characterize interference from the same data used to detect targets. While sufficient in benign environments and less-stressing applications, this circa 1950's signal processing framework is inadequate when confronted with complex surface target engagement applications. The instability of the statistical signal processing methodology increases with higher adaptive sensor-dimensionality and needs to be avoided to maintain the United States' combat advantage in surface target engagement. Over the past 20+ years, the US has gathered a large quantity of information on the physical and electrical characteristics of the operational environment but was not able to adequately apply this information in the radar front-end signal processing to address the complex clutter problem. Recent breakthroughs in high performance embedded computing (HPEC) and real-time database technologies are now enabling the KASSPER concept - radically altering the fundamental 'front-end' signal processing architectures through intelligent, real-time integration of environmental knowledge (DTED/DFAD, SAR Imagery, and other onboard/offboard sources), high performance embedded computing (HPEC), electromagnetic codes, and real-time database query and retrieval technologies.  DARPA/SPO and AFRL/SNRT are soliciting white papers for radically altering the fundamental signal processing architectures of the ISR radar discipline. White papers should present revolutionary concepts for improved sensor signal processing performance in complex interference environments through the exploitation of environmental knowledge sources within the high-speed front-end processing environment. Specific areas of interest include: (1) knowledge-aided adaptive signal processing techniques for interference mitigation and constant false alarm (CFAR) detection processing.  Specific examples include, but are not limited to: (1.1) knowledge-aided intelligent 'training' methods for optimum space-time weight vectors; and (1.2) knowledge-aided pre-whitening of the space-time multichannel received signals to reduce the number of adaptive degrees-of-freedom required; and (2) real-time KASSPER processing architectures.  Hence, compatibility of the adaptive filtering process (STAP) with the (CFAR) detection process and the utilized knowledge sources is essential in this effort. 
Demonstrations utilizing the AFRL Surveillance Facility at the Rome Research Site, Rome, NY are permitted and encouraged under this PRDA.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION.  DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. 
Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a three (3) to four (4) page white paper with a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, woman-owned, small  disadvantaged, veteran-owned small, or HUBZone small business, or a Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution.  Small business only should send one (1) copy of the cover letter only (1st Class Mail, Unclassified Only) to ATTN:  Ms Janis Norelli, Director of Small Business, AFRL/IFB, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514.  The white paper will be formatted as follows:  Section A:  Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B:  Task Objective; Section C:  Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). All white papers submitted in responses to this PRDA must be addressed to ATTN: William Baldygo, Reference PRDA-01-07-IFKPA, AFRL/SNRT, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514. 
Multiple white papers may be submitted in different areas of technology.  White papers will be accepted until June 30, 2004.  The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this PRDA.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent award. 
White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Individual white paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other white papers submitted under the announcement.  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:  FY02 - 30Jun01; FY03 - 30Jun02; FY04 - 30Jun03; FY05 - 30 Jun04.  White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each Fiscal Year after the dates cited. Evaluation of white papers will be performed using the following criteria:  a) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, b) The innovativeness of the proposed approach and /or techniques, c) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, and d) consideration of other factors, such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity and capability to perform the requirements of the effort.  The criteria used to evaluate white papers will also be used to determine whether white papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this PRDA and of interest to the Government.  Only (a), (b), and (c) above will apply to proposals.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals. 
Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Principal funding of this PRDA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY02.  Individual awards will normally range from 6 months to 36 months with dollar amounts ranging from $25,000 to $250,000 per year. Total funding for this PRDA is approximately $12.0M.  Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submissions.  Responders are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission as well as a fax number, and an e-mail address. 
Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, Joetta A. Bernhard, for information if they contemplate responding.  Export-controlled technical data may be involved; only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed to access such data.  For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistic Information Service at 1-888-352-9333, or on the web at Http://www.dlis.dla.mil/ccal.  Selected offerors may be required to review classified material up to the Secret level, therefore personnel identified for assignment to the proposed effort must be cleared for access to Secret information.  The cost of preparing white papers and proposals in response this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Routine questions are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the contracting officer, Joetta A. Bernhard, 315-330-2308. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer or program manager, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Reid S. Lerum, LtCol, Chief, Contracting Division, at 315-330-7746.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the selection process. 
This PRDA is open and effective until September 30, 2005. 
A copy of the publication "BAA & PRDA: A Guide for Industry" may be accessed here: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.  All responsible organizations may submit a white paper, which shall be considered. Proposers are warned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Jackson, Mississippi, New Construction, Design Phase, United States District Courthouse, Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session.

On Wednesday, August 7, 2002, the United States General Services Administration (GSA), will conduct a Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session for prospective Small Business Subcontractors/Consultants for the design phase of a new United States District Courthouse.  The Networking Session will be conducted from 6 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. in Room 501B of The McCoy Federal Building, 100 West Capitol Street, Jackson, Mississippi.

The facility to be constructed will be occupied by the U.S. District Court, U. S. Court of Appeals, U.S. Magistrate Court, U.S.Bankruptcy Court, U.S. Attorney, U.S. Marshal Service, Circuit Library, U.S. Probation Service, U.S. Trustee, Congressional Offices, and GSA.  The Estimated Total Project Cost (ETPC) is between $68,000,000 and $78,000,000 and most design disciplines are expected to be represented.

The Subcontracting Networking Session is intended to affirm GSA?s recognition of the talent that exists in the Small Business Community and its commitment to opening a dialogue between that community and the firms that have been Short-Listed as the prospective Architect/Engineer for this project.

Prospective Small Business Subcontractors/Consultants will be given an opportunity to network with the Short-Listed Architect/Engineer firms and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors/consultants.  Because GSA is not permitted by law to be a party to contractual relationships between Primes and Subcontractor/Consultants, any contracts that may develop between potential Primes and Subcontractors/Consultants as a result of the Networking Session will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.

Questions about the Networking Session may be directed to either David Gibson, GSA?s Small Business Outreach Specialist, Telephone (404) 331-2366, E-Mail DavidA.Gibson@GSA.GOV; or Pat Geisinger, GSA?s Small Business Technical Advisor, Telephone (404) 331-3031, E-Mail Pat.Geisinger@GSA.GOV.

This information will be used to assist in development of a Request for Proposal. Below VA has provided information regarding the purpose, scope, and background of the project; and specific questions that we would like industry to respond to regarding commercial practices for medical records coding. =20 Purpose The purpose of the project is to improve medical records coding for veteran=92s health care encounters. =20 Scope=20 This project includes all VA Medical Centers, their affiliated clinics and other VA authorized health care services. Background:  =20 1.  =09The Under Secretary for Health directed that as of October 1, 1996, VHA facilities were to begin collecting and reporting coded diagnostic, procedural and practitioner data for all ambulatory care encounters.  While VHA facilities had been electronically reporting information about each outpatient visit to the national Outpatient Clinic System (OPC), the new requirement forced a major shift in the way VHA medical centers collected and stored ambulatory care information.  Outpatient information is entered through the Veterans Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Patient Care Encounter (PCE) or Appointment Manager (AM).  Due to increased coding demands, shortage of qualified coding specialists and change in reimbursement structure, VHA is experiencing a coding backlog and requires additional coding services. 2.    Facilities now report patient identity, date and time of service, practitioners Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (formerly HCFA) Individual Provider Taxonomy type code, place of service, active problems(s) (ICD-9-CM codes) and service(s) (CPT codes) for every inpatient and ambulatory encounter, professional inpatient service and/or ancillary service. 3.  The value of PCE data to managers and researchers depends on how accurately it portrays the actual clinical events that take place in the medical center.  Data validity begins with practitioners accurately recording diagnoses and procedures.  That information must be accurately entered into the facility=92s computer system (VistA). 4.  Beginning September 1, 1999, CPT-4 procedure coding is used as a basis for facility and professional charges for bills submitted to third party carriers.  Coders are held responsible for the accuracy of codes and compliance with federal legislation and VHA guidelines. Questions:=20 Please respond in writing to the following questions:=20 Background information: Name of firm Address, phone number and point of contact Size of the firm (both number of employees and receipts) Brief description of relevant experience in this field, including the number of years providing coding services to health care organizations. Questions: =B7=09Would vendor be interested in participating in a coding contract where contract award would go to multiple vendors? =20 =B7=09What, in your experience, would be the best pricing structure for VA and why? i.e. price per hour, price per encounter, discharge, ambulatory surgery,=20 etc.? =20 =B7=09Please provide pricing estimates for: =091) Outpatient Professional Services Coding =092) Outpatient Facility Coding =093) Outpatient Coding with PCE Data Entry - PCE is a VA specific term for patient care encounter. The private sector would have a repository for recording coded data in conjunction with a patient encounter =094) Inpatient Professional Services coding =095) Inpatient Professional Services coding with Data Entry =096) Inpatient Facility Coding =097) Inpatient Coding with PTF Data Entry =09=09- PTF is a VA specific term for patient treatment file. The private sector may use a similar repository or abstracting system for inpatient hospitalizations used to capture and store ICD or DRG information. =097) E/M Documentation Training =098)=20 Ambulatory surgery professional services coding =099) Laboratory coding =0910) Radiology coding =0911) Coding/billing process improvement consulting =B7=09What is a reasonable "turn around" time from the time the encounter is identified for an encounter or discharge to be coded and uploaded? =B7=09What is a reasonable number of encounters that a coder can produce in an 8-hour day? =B7=09Would the requirement of credentialed coders preclude you from participating? =B7=09What kind of credentials does your company accept for coders? =B7=09Would a "3-year coding experience" requirement preclude you from participating? =B7=09Would an alternative requirement that coders be placed "on-site" at a VHA facility preclude you from participating? =B7=09Would an alternative requirement that coders code remotely either on line or on paper preclude you from participating? =B7=09VHA has stringent security requirements, including not being able to transmit individually identified information across the Internet.   What is your experience with your current customers as far a security is concerned? =09 =B7=09Would adhering to VHA's security requirements, including our HIPAA business associate agreement, preclude you from participating?  =20 =B7=09Would use of an encoder product required for each coder, for each encounter, preclude you from participating? =B7=09What would you recommend as successful quality control measures? =B7=09What is your definition of accuracy for: =B7=09 An inpatient facility encounter =B7=09Patient professional services for one inpatient stay =B7=09An outpatient professional service encounter? =B7=09What would you recommend for successful productivity measures? =B7=09What kind of management and statistical reports to the VA facility do you recommend?  How often do you recommend providing them?

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) contemplates awarding a sole source contract to The Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning (AECLP) to compile a comprehensive, detailed national summary of the status of lead poisoning primary prevention activities.  This information will be compiled into a book, disseminated to grantees and other external partners, and used to influence policy and funding decisions at the state and local levels.  The Alliance To End Childhood Lead Poisoning (AECLP) is the only national public interest organization dedicated to protecting children from lead poisoning.  Since its formation in 1990, the Alliance has been the preeminent policy and educational organization advocating for workable primary prevention solutions to lead poisoning.  The AECLP is uniquely qualified to develop Building Blocks for Primary Prevention in Public Health because it is the only organization with the skills, experience, and interdisciplinary reach across the policy, program, technical, and regulatory aspects of the health, housing, and environmental dimensions of lead poisoning prevention.  The AECLP championed the national shift to prevention by helping craft Title X, the landmark 1992 federal lead poisoning prevention law.  Its staff and board members chaired the Title X Task Force and its three major committees, which crafted the original vision for making the housing stock lead-safe.  With the help of the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), the AECLP developed a model state law for lead poisoning prevention to translate the vision of the Task Force into legislative language.  Since that time, the AECLP has closely followed and influenced the development of every federal program, standard, regulation, and guideline related to lead poisoning prevention.  Among other things, the AECLP has helped lead the national approach towards mainstreaming the knowledge, tools, and strategies of lead poisoning prevention, including building capacity for lead-safe work practices among painters and remodelers and expanding capacity for clearance dust testing.  Over the past decade, the AECLP has established excellent working relationships with directors and staff of scores of state and local health departments, who frequently call on the AECLP for assistance and advice.  These relationships are mandatory for the identification of promising and innovative strategies.  In addition, the Alliance anchors the national network of more than 300 grassroots organizations committed to lead poisoning prevention and it maintains close working relationships with many of these groups.  The AECLP, with Vanguard Communications, directed the Campaign for Lead-Safe America, the national education campaign that helped raise awareness and delivered targeted information about lead safety strategies to parents, trades people, and landlords.  The AECLP keeps the larger lead poisoning prevention community apprised of important developments through its bi-monthly Alliance Alert newsletter and maintains the two most widely used listservs, L-S America and LeadNet, through which practitioners can compare notes across the country.  The AECLP web site, www.aeclp.org, provides a source of accurate and relevant information to parents, practitioners, and policy makers on many aspects of lead poisoning prevention, with an average of 8,000 visitors each month.  Each of these electronic communications networks are important to identifying innovative strategies and spreading the word about Building Blocks for Primary Prevention in Public Health.  Over the past decade, AECLP staff have done cutting-edge work and published resource documents on the constellation of issues and strategies that impact on lead poisoning prevention.  As the only organization with conversance in and command of all these strategies, the Alliance is uniquely qualified to tackle the assignment of crafting Building Blocks for Primary Prevention in Public Health.  The contract period of performance will two years from the contract award date.  The intended contract is for services for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41 U.S.C.  253 (c)(1).  AECLP is believed to be the only entity with ready access to the best technical advice available about the effectiveness of a range of strategies for evaluating and controlling lead hazards in housing through the National Center for Healthy Housing.  The Government knows of only one qualified source capable of providing the required services.  This is not a request for proposals.  Interested parties shall submit in writing; their name, address, point of contact, and telephone number.  Interested parties shall also submit a brief capability statement indicating their capabilities to perform this service.  This information shall be submitted in writing, or faxed to (770) 488-2671, or E-Mailed to BAS4@CDC.GOV.  Attn: Barry E. Smith.  Interested parties that fail to provide the required information within 15 calendar days from date of the publication of this announcement will be considered not responsive to this announcement and no information will be provided.  All responsible sources that meet the above requirements may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  See numbered note 26.

<DESC>RFI 786-45-03 TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT PROJECT NATIONAL CEMETERY ADMINISTRATION This is a Request for Information (RFI) for an anticipated procurement project to automate the transportation procurement process for the National Cemetery Administration at Quantico, Virginia.  The acquisition team for this project is presently conducting market research into possible alternative information systems. Contractors interested in participating by providing feedback, recommendations, questions, solutions etc. concerning this project should send their comments, name, address, phone number, fax number and email address to the attention of Diane Campbell, Contracting Officer at the following address: =20 Department of Veterans Affairs National Cemetery Administration Centralized Contracting Division (402D31) 5105 Russell Road Quantico, VA 22134-3903.=20 The NCA envisions the proposed system as concurrently supporting the following two prospective business processes in the manner describe below:=20 The first prospective business process involves shipment requests that flow from machine generated production orders.  The NCA sends production orders for grave markers to marker manufacturers.  When the manufacturer (who is also the shipper)  has completed the production of the markers on an order, he will log into the proposed system through a web interface. The system will present him with a list of his open/unshipped production orders. When he clicks on a production order, he is then presented with a list of line items on that production order. Each line item may contain several markers that will be shipped together and considered as a single shipment. He will then select with a checkbox each line item that he has finished producing and is ready to ship or he may select the entire order. He will also provide a date that he wants the shipment(s) to be picked up.  When he submits his selections, the proposed system will generate a shipment request record for each line item based on the data in the production order. That record is then sent through a pricing process to find shipment prices from several different transportation companies.  The proposed system will compare the prices and award the shipment to the best value carrier.=20 The proposed system will then format the priced  and awarded shipment record as both a paper bill of lading to be printed at the users web-browser and also as a X12 EDI bill of lading (211 or 858 transaction sets) to be transmitted electronically to the carrier. Concurrently, the system will also transmit a X12 EDI pickup notification (216 transaction set) to inform the carrier of the requested pickup date. This process will be fully automated except for the act of the shipper/manufacturer triggering the process when he is ready to ship the goods.=20 In addition to the automated process above for machine created shipments, the system should have a web-based interface to allow a user to create a shipment request record via manual input and then submit the request for pricing.  The system would then try to price the shipment request and return a list of carriers to the user. Shipments that are unable to be priced will be put in a hold queue for intervention by the transportation supervisor who may manually price the shipment. Once the shipment is priced, the shipment is returned to the requestor. The requesting user may then select a carrier and award the shipment to the carrier. The awarded shipment will then be printed as a paper bill of lading at the user=92s web-browser and will also be sent electronically via EDI to the carrier, along with an EDI pickup notification.=20 The following is a brief description of the objectives of this project:=20 a.=09Be able to process two types of shipments: i.=09Machine created shipments triggered by user request =96 Accept a list of manufacturer production orders and several elements of shipping data such as destination address, piece count, and item types via automated input from an Oracle database. The proposed system will take this order data and combine it with data from its own relational database tables containing information on item properties (such as item dimensions and weights) and tables of addresses  to create a complete shipment record.  The system will this present this list of shipment records in a web interface to allow a user to trigger further processing after an order has finished production and is ready to be shipped.=20 ii.=09User created shipments -=20 Accept data from a user via an interface such as a web browser. User will input most shipping data with some being retrieved from relational database tables.=20 b.=09Accept rate tender/tariff submissions from carriers via X.12 EDI (602 transaction set) and also allow for manual creation and update of rates from a user interface such as a web browser.=20 c.=09Calculate and compare freight rates from several carriers for each shipment according to the rating scheme found in VA  Baseline Rate Publication VA-1000. This is also the same rating process used by GSA.=20 d.=09Allow for both automated assigning of shipment to best value carrier for machine created shipments and for manual assignments through a user interface for user created shipments.=20 e.=09Produce and print a paper Bill of Lading and produce and transmit an X.12 EDI Bill of Lading (or a file capable of being translated into X.12 format (both 211 and 858 transaction sets)) . f.=09Assign each Bill of Lading a unique bill of lading number.=20 g.=09Allow a user to request an EDI shipment status report (214 transaction set) for all shipments (both machine created and user created). The proposed system will receive the status report response from the carrier, update the shipment record to reflect the new information,  and present it back to the requesting user in a user interface such as a web browser. =20 h.=09Allow the system=92s administrator to assign discrete levels of privileges to users.  There must be at least 5 levels of privileges: System Administrator, Transportation Supervisor (may create, view, and edit all shipments in his group), Transportation Specialist  (may manually create, edit and process his own shipments), Limited User (may only view and trigger machine created shipments), View-Only user who may view shipments records and reports, request status reports, and print documents but may not create or edit shipment records.=20 i.=09Contain an interface for free-style SQL queries for privileged users.=20 j.=09Allow records to be corrected and for corrected bills of lading to be printed and transmitted.=20 The VA owns a Sterling Gentrans EDI translator at our Austin Automation Center in Texas.  That translator will be available to NCA to accept our input that will then be translated into X12 documents. The translator will then transmit the X12 document to the vendor or the vendor's VAN.  The translator will also be available to receive documents from the vendors (such as X12 status reports), decode them, and forward that output back to NCA. The proposed system may incorporate its own EDI translator or it may use the VA=92s translator in Austin.=20

<DESC>A continuing demand exists for improved aeropropulsion and power systems to power a wide range of advanced aerospace vehicles in subsonic and supersonic speed ranges.  Types of applications range from small “personal airvehicles” to supersonic global access vehicles.	This synopsis is to announce NASA’s continuing interest for Research and Development in the area of Revolutionary Aeropropulsion and Power Concepts and Technology. Interested parties are required to express their intentions with regard to the submittal of a proposal in writing by email to both points of contact below, on or before 10/15/02 – to obtain detailed proposal submission instructions and requirements. The technologies, described herein, should contribute to the advancement of science and engineering in the areas within atmosphere air vehicle propulsion and power systems.  Participation is open to all categories of organizations: industry, educational institutions, other non-profit organizations, and other government agencies. Under the auspices of NASA’s Revolutionary Aeropropulsion Concepts (RAC), Green Efficient Aircraft Propulsion (GEAP) and Quiet Aircraft Technology (QAT) Projects, Phase I proposals have previously been solicited, selected, and are now near conclusion, for study/feasibility research in the area of revolutionary and innovative aeropropulsion and power concepts. The goal is to aggressively pursue revolutionary aeropropulsion and power concepts capable of 2x payload-range increase above current state-of-the-art for commercial and military aircraft, with near zero emissions capability, leading to new and high performance aircraft systems. The key objectives are to: •    Push technology barriers, enable breakthroughs, investigate unconventional systems •    Develop sustained, long-term relationship with university community and innovative commercial partnerships with industry to foster and stimulate technology innovations and exploit advanced technology breakthroughs  •	Apply integrated propulsion system analyses, supported by risk/safety/performance analyses to assess high payoff concepts, and to identify technology barriers, research needs, and steps toward technology maturation   •      Identify further technology maturation opportunities for future aviation systems. •     Provide technologies for lowering engine noise while maintaining high performance for future aircraft propulsion systems. •     Develop technologies to reduce fan, jet and core noise sources, as well as analytical tools to predict engine noise. •  Explore innovative aeropropulsion/power concepts or technologies that will enable radical advancements in capability, reliability, safety, affordability and environmental compatibility. •	  Explore unique propulsion/airframe configurations and will enable here-to-fore unachievable aero mobility options. •    Use multidisciplinary technology approaches to provide progress toward the goal. The areas of research interest are generally divided into two major categories:  1)	  Concepts – aeropropulsion or power systems, configurations or major subsystems {e.g., engines, power generation units, integration of propulsion and airframe, noise reduction, etc.} 2)	  Technologies – science, art, physical phenomena {e.g., materials, combustion, electrochemical processes, emissions and noise, etc.} This NRA synopsis is to publicize the second phase (Phase II) of a two phased effort.  Phase I consisted of a 9-month effort concentrated on establishing the scientific or technical merit, feasibility, benefits and challenges of the proposed innovation, and on providing a basis for continued research in Phase II. Any Offeror proposing for this Phase II effort is required to be at the equivalent technology maturation level as the current Contractor’s who are performing the Phase I Study/Feasibility effort.   Phase II projects will be selected via competitive down-selection of proposals from Phase I Contractors and qualify candidates. The objective of Phase II is to continue and build on results of the R/R&D effort from Phase I.  Phase II will consist of up to a 24-month effort with selected contracts being funded up to $250,000/year. Phase II deliverables resulting from the effort will include a final report and may include but not be limited to a new technology report; preliminary design study; and/or prototype hardware. The Government expects that only the initial Phase I Contractors will be capable of successfully competing for the subsequent phase. However, proposals from all responsible sources submitted by the specified due date will be considered. To contend for Phase II awards, such prospective Offerors must demonstrate or provide proof of design maturity equivalent to that of the Phase I Contractors.  Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render the proposal unacceptable, with no further consideration for Contract award. (Reference NFS 1817.7301-5) The Government's award of Phase II contracts is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for award purposes can be made.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) in support of the Department of Defense (DoD) is seeking commercial vendors whose products are designed, configured and fully ready to support a privatized (fully-Government owned, operated, and supported), secure (at least Triple-DES [Data Encryption Standard]), portable (able to be operated in both fixed and deployed locations world-wide) messaging system upgrade/replacement.  DISA desires to interact with vendors, obtain loaned products for evaluation, and conduct independent tests to determine if the products should be incorporated into a future portable messaging system architecture.

THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) OR REIMBURSE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS RFI.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Information provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process for a privatized, secure, portable messaging system upgrade/replacement and may lead to the development of a specification for the messaging system, to include the potential for multiple contracts to cover the messaging needs in various regions of the CONUS and OCONUS.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

The Government invites comments and interested parties to provide written responses to describe their resources and capabilities to fulfill the requirements for a privatized, secure, portable messaging system and provide a rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost to the government.  Additional information in the written response should include but is not limited to:  documentation addressing the technical specifications of the product; a point of contact for technical questions about the product; any proprietary/non-disclosure data requirements and availability for testing in a proof of concept demonstration.

The products submitted will be evaluated to determine if the messaging system incorporates design attributes to allow privatized use, Triple-DES encryption, and worldwide deployablity/use.  Other design attributes are also desirable and will be considered, including ease of set-up and use, small footprint, light weight, ability to prioritize and tailor message distribution, non-proprietary based, scalability and interoperability with IP or cellular-based systems.  DISA may invite selected vendors to demonstrate the capabilities of their products, or to demonstrate the ability of their portable messaging system within a selected DoD application environment.  There is no implied promise that all products submitted in response to this RFI will be invited to demonstrate capabilities.  DISA will determine which products are selected according to the needs of the DoD.  The results of the testing will be made available to all vendors chosen to demonstrate their products.

All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable Government regulations.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  If there is a GSA or other contract vehicle already available for potential procurement of the technology being proposed, please include this information in the response.  Firms who wish to respond to this should contact Major Bob Thoens at Defense Information Systems Agency, J5, 2743 Defense Blvd. SW, Anacostia Annex, DC 20373-5815, Telephone (202) 757-5211, email bfthoens@whmo.mil

<SUBJECT>--GUIDED MULTIPLE LAUNCH ROCKET SYSTEM UNITARY COMPONENT ADVANCED DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command is seeking comments from interested parties concerning a draft statement of work for Component Advanced Development (CAD) Risk Reduction Activities for development of a unitary warhead variant of the Guided Multip le Launch Rocket System (GMLRS).  It is anticipated that any future acquisition for this effort will be conducted on a sole source basis to Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control Dallas, since they are the designer, developer, and producer of the basic and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS/GMLRS) and associated product improvements.  It is anticipated that the CAD phase would identify, define, and develop the system level technical requirements and interfaces for the GMLRS Unitary Rocket.  The d raft statement of work for this effort is provided as follows.  The objectives of the GMLRS Unitary CAD Program are to define the system architecture, to reduce the risk of component and subsystem development through engineering studies and demonstrations in a relevant environment, and to determine the optimal set of subsystems to be integrated into the full system.  Efforts in support of the above objectives include system engineering studies and analyses to define and allocate system performance requireme nts to the subsystem level, to define subsystem interfaces, and to develop the subsystems to be integrated into the system.  This effort will also generate acquisition information necessary for a Milestone B decision.  System Design shall include:  perform ing systems engineering analyses of system performance requirements; allocating system level requirements to the subsystem level; deriving subsystem requirements and designing subsystem interfaces; as well as, conducting subsystem and system level design v erification tests.  Specific areas to be studied include, but are not limited to:  navigation algorithm design; warhead structure design trades; warhead mechanical design and interface design; DVT ground testing including bending/stiffness, modal survey, r ocket pod handling, warhead subsystem testing, and warhead interface testing; as well as compatibility with GMLRS telemetry system.  The effort shall also cover the design and development of an ESAF, to include: performing subsystem development and qualifi cation tests, as well as conducting a preliminary design review (PDR) and critical design review (CDR) for the ESAF design.  Subject effort shall also include the following:  designing and development of a unitary warhead; conducting a PDR; fabricating pro totype warheads for test and evaluation; conducting a warhead CDR; conducting design, procurement, and planning as required to support subsequent rocket and pod fabrication and testing; as well as, supporting the Government in preparation for Milestone B, by providing information (i.e., MANPRINT assessment, etc…).  The applicable NAICS Code is 336414, with a size standard of 1,000 employees.  It is anticipated that any future RFP for this effort will be issued on a sole source basis, to Lockheed Martin Miss iles and Fire Control Dallas, as previously set forth herein.  Parties interested in providing comments or other information concerning capabilities, technical requirements, or estimated pricing/delivery should submit the information to the Contracting Off icer by 15 October 2002, addressed as follows:  U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command, Attn: AMSAM-AC-TM-C / MAJ Dolloff, Building 5303, Martin Road, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5280; telephone (256) 876-4588; facsimile (256) 876-3452; e-mail scott.dolloff @redstone.army.mil.  This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  This notice is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or announcement of solicitation.  Responses to this announcement are on a voluntary basis.
