<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with the Institute for Defense and Government Advancement (IDGA), 535 Fifth Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10017 for the purchase of an Exhibit at the 5th Annual Sensor and Shooter Conference.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 561591.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION: 

AFRL/RIGC required the services of IDGA for providing exhibit space for the IDGA's 5th Annual Sensor to Shooter Conference on 31 March 2008 through 2 April 2008 at the Hilton Hotel in Arlington, VA. The conference will highlight the SmartCapture Advanced Video Coding technology developed in part by AFRL Dual Use program and other AFRL programs. IDGA is the sponsor of this event; therefore, no other source of supply exists.  A search was conducted for other available conferences to reach the intended audience; however, the Sensor to Shooter Conference is the most effective for the presentation of the Dual Use program.

Normal travel time between the hotel and the airport, during any time of the day (including rush hour) must not be longer than 60 minutes.

This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services. An offer/quotation that requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable.

Quotations are being requested via the relating solicitation that has been uploaded at this website, RFQ HSBP1008Q1654. This is an RFQ issued in accordance with FAR Part 13.

All future information about this acquisition including amendments to this procurement requirement will also be distributed through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.

The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this RFQ to the responsible vendor whose quotation conforming to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors  considered. Responses will be evaluated on the basis of best value. CBP expects to acquire the accommodation services at nightly rates not exceeding the current GSA per diem level of $159.00 for Nassau County.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for dSpace computing systems and components to upgrade the capabilities of the SAFTI Lab.    NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from dSpace Incorporated, as the only known source who can meet the Agency's need.	dSpace can provide these systems to expand the capabilities of the SAFTI Lab to include the ability to implement health monitoring schemes on dedicated hardware as well as the development and implementation of novel fault tolerent architecture.  dSpace is highly specialized in offering the capability of seamlessly integrating SIMULINK models into a real-time environment which has a user friendly graphical interface as well as various required input/output capabilities  such as AIRINC 429, Ethernet, and analog/digital ports. Using dSpace's computer systems are cost effective because it reduces the need for software developers, expert software engineer, graphics developer, and input/output designers. It would take substantial duplication of time and effort for another company to provide a comparable system and those costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. dSpace is proprietary hardware and software and these upgrades are only available from dSpace.

<DESC>Introduction

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, has a requirement to support genomic sequencing activities, which include high throughput sequencing, comparative genomic sequencing and genotyping.

Description 

This contract provides for the continuation of the Microbial Genome Sequencing Centers program. The current contracts are due to expire on February 28, 2009. Through this contract, up to two large-scale Genomic Sequencing Centers for Infectious Diseases (hereinafter also referred to as ''Centers'') will be established that support a diverse set of genome sequencing activities. For purposes of this contract, genomic sequencing activities include high throughput sequencing, comparative genomic sequencing and genotyping. High throughput sequencing capacity is defined as the capability to produce high quality sequencing data in a highly efficient manner with continuous increase in efficiency and decrease in costs; generate a diverse variety of genome sequence products; develop and implement new technologies; and maintain an automated production pipeline with a throughput of 20 million successful sequence reads per year. Comparative genomics and genotyping are defined as using high throughput platforms to examine the whole genome for genetic variation. 

Genomes that will be sequenced through these Centers include microorganisms considered agents of bioterrorism (NIAID Category A-C priority pathogens http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/default.htm), clinical isolates, closely related species and strains, invertebrate vectors of diseases, and microorganisms responsible for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/topics/emerging/list.htm).  

Emphasis will be placed on sequencing multiple strains and isolates of specific microbial species and communities than on sequencing individual microorganisms.

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following technical evaluation criteria: 

1) adequacy, appropriateness, and feasibility of the scientific and technical approaches to providing proposed sequencing and genotyping activities; 2) adequacy, appropriateness, and feasibility of plans to provide genomic sequencing and genotyping services and resources to the scientific community; 3) appropriateness and relevance of the documented training, education, experience, expertise and availability of proposed scientific and technical personnel in relation to their specific duties and responsibilities; 4) adequacy, appropriateness and availability of facilities and other resources including equipment, computation facilities, and software tools; 5) adequacy and appropriateness of plans for compliance with all safety guidelines and regulations; and 6) adequacy, appropriateness, and feasibility of proposed organizational and staffing plans, communications, project management and database management. 

It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about February 6, 2009. It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately 29.9.

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about March 5, 2008, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/). This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<SOLNBR>RFQ-DC-08-00098
<RESPDATE>030708
<ARCHDATE>04072008
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Paul Dawson, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-4473
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620 EPA intends to issue a purchase order to Professor Jay Shimshack, Assistant Professor of Economics, Tufts University, on a sole source basis using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The required services are set forth in the attached statement of work.  Prof. Shimshack  is considered the only person who can most effectively and expeditiously provide these services to EPA for the following multiple reasons: 1.	Prof. Shimshack was contracted to fulfill Tasks 1 and 2 of this SOW by December 31, 2007. This included research and preparation of the Whitepaper on  Measurement of General and Specific Deterrent Impacts of Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement. Prof. Shimshack was selected over the other offerors because he demonstrated a clear understanding of Task 1, submitted a creative and extremely focused bid, and was able to provide the contractual  services to EPA at the best value and price. Prof. Shimshack was exceptionally responsive to ORD and OECA in the post-award period.  All of his work and communication was timely and responsive.  The final product was extremely satisfying to all reviewers in ORD and OECA because it answered all of  the critical research questions in the SOW substantively and completely.  This is critical to the government now because Tasks 3-5, which describe new work to be initiated and completed in calendar year 2008, directly follows up and builds on the work that has already been performed to accomplish  Tasks 1 and 2.  In our experience, 100% ultimate satisfaction with all aspects of any Contractor's work on thorny measurement and policy issues such as those addressed in Tasks 1 and 2 of the SOW is a rare occurrence.  Yet such were the reactions in the two offices to Prof. Shimshack's work on  Tasks 1 and 2.  It is therefore strongly in the government's interests that ORD and OECA continue the follow-up work on Tasks 3-5, work that is a direct outcome of the initial Tasks, with the same Contractor. 2.	Task 2, under the original SOW, was to participate in an invitation-only, two-day  workshop with participants from ORD, OECA, OIG and OMB, to present the Contractor's research results, findings, and recommendations, on optimal methods to determine the effects of specific and general deterrence.  At the Workshop, Prof. Shimshack presented his findings in an informative,  transparent, responsive, and persuasive manner, demonstrating a full understanding of OECA's complex performance measurement needs.  In all instances, Prof. Shimshack's professional demeanor was clear, helpful, and essential to realizing successful workshop outcomes.  He was also very responsive to  workshop participants' questions and concerns.  In this vein, Prof. Shimshack personally developed and successfully proposed to workshop participants an approach to determine more generalizable specific and general deterrence measures that have become new Tasks 3-5 in the Amended SOW.  Prof.  Shimshack thus possesses a set of unique knowledge and skills, including communication skills, viewed by ORD and OECA as essential to completing new Tasks 3-5 successfully and efficiently.  3.	As described in paragraph 2 above, Prof. Shimshack argued convincingly, in performing the first stage of  this project, for a series of statistical analyses to determine the broader applicability of the two published econometric models that measure general and specific deterrence to additional industry sectors, media, and regulations.  The general deterrence model in question was developed personally  by Prof. Shimshack, who published it following formal peer review.  The specific deterrence model, also published following formal peer review, was developed by Prof. Wayne Gray of Tufts University.  Prof. Gray also attended the workshop described in paragraph 2.  These factors are relevant sole  source considerations because the crux of the new Tasks is to take the two, preexisting models and simplify them.  Accomplishing this requires access to the underlying data used to develop the models and results in the peer reviewed formal studies published by the two Professors.  To do so  effectively and expeditiously, it is strongly in the government's interest, if not a practical imperative, to contract with Prof. Shimshack to do so because he has in-depth knowledge of both models, actual and sole physical possession and sole proprietorship of the quantitative data for the  published general deterrence model results.  Furthermore, it is in EPA's interests for a single contractor to be responsible for performing all of the tasks in this project because the issues raised by specific and general deterrence measurement are interrelated. More specifically, the same EPA  interventions produce both effects, and therefore consistent modeling approaches are required.  These factors indicate that an alternative approach of splitting analysis of specific and deterrence measurement into two separate contracts would not yield optimum results for EPA in a timely manner.   Prof. Shimshack has already collaborated professionally with Prof. Gray with whom he enjoys a collegial working relationship.  No other offeror would be able to complete Tasks 3-5 at the same level of quality in as timely a manner and for an equivalently reasonable cost.   4.	The Project Officer  and Deputy Project Officer for the Amended SOW have significant professional experience with deterrence research.  They understand, based on extensive, hands-on, actual experience with such research projects in connection with the ORD National Center for Environmental Research's Science to Achieve  Results grants program, that when a researcher is starting essentially from scratch, these types of analyses can take literally years, and hundreds of thousands of dollars, to complete.  Indeed, at least one year is commonly spent by such researchers just on their study-specific data assembly work.   Such a time frame is not acceptable to EPA, however, as OECA formally committed to OMB, in July 2006, to formulate a research approach to measuring the impact of deterrence in a timely fashion.  Prof. Shimshack, in ORD's and OECA's professional judgment, will be uniquely able to focus immediately  on the key new objectives of calibrating the preexisting general and specific deterrence models and apply a simplified form of them to other sectors and media.   Therefore, Prof. Shimshack is in a uniquely optimal position to complete Tasks 3 through 5 within 5 months, as required by OECA and ORD.   Specifically, OECA and ORD need Tasks 3 and 4 to be fulfilled within 3.5 months of the contract effective date, and the training of OECA staff to take place shortly thereafter, depending on scheduling and availability factors. 5.	Task 5 will require the Contractor to travel to Washington to train  OECA staff on the measurement approaches developed under Tasks 3 and 4. Prior exchanges between Prof. Shimshack and relevant OECA staff have left OECA with an exceptionally high level of confidence in Prof. Shimshack's ability to develop and present the required training in a productive and  cost-effective manner.  This is important because doing so will require developing and presenting straightforward methodologies that can be readily replicated by OECA staff without requiring excessive resource and staff time. In summary, based on these factors, it is ORD's and OECA's considered  opinion that only Prof. Jay Shimshack is capable of fulfilling new Tasks 3-5 in the Amended SOW at a high level of quality, and as expeditiously and efficiently as necessary, to meet the government's needs in connection with this project.  Prof. Shimshack should therefore be selected as EPA's sole  source supplier for the Amended SOW. NO SOLICIATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding the above, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capabilities statement, which if received by the response date of this  announcement will be considered. Responses to posting must be in writing and submitted to Mr. Paul M. Dawson, Contracting Officer, via the e-mail link below. A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the  Government. AMENDED STATEMENT OF WORK COMPLIANCE AND DETERRENCE RESEARCH AND WORKSHOP PROJECT: MEASUREMENT OF GENERAL AND SPECIFIC DETERRENT  IMPACTS OF COMPLIANCE MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND: EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) conducts a range of activities,  including implementing an Economics and Decision Sciences (EDS) Science to Achieve Results (STAR) research program. Within this research program the Corporate Environmental Behavior and the Effects of Government Interventions and Voluntary Programs Request for Assistance (RFA) funds scientific  research aimed at increasing our understanding of the motivations influencing environmental compliance and behavior. An important client for this thread of compliance research is the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA). OECA is responsible, along with State environmental  agencies, for enforcing and assuring compliance with the nation's environmental laws.  Beginning with its National Performance Measures Strategy report completed in Fiscal Year (FY) 1998, OECA has implemented an active and conscientious effort to identify, develop, and use performance indicators to  manage the national compliance and enforcement program and enhance accountability to the public.  In particular, OECA has focused on measuring not just outputs or activities (e.g., the number of enforcement actions) but the intermediate and end outcomes or results of those activities (e.g., pounds  of pollutants reduced through enforcement actions).  In addition, OECA has expanded its measures to encompass all of its principal program activities, including assistance and incentives rather than only monitoring and enforcement. Increasingly, OECA is being asked to improve the results that are  achieved and how to measure and evaluate the effectiveness of its activities.  For example, in preparing the 2007 President's Budget, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed OECA to, among other things, "look at using metrics that are statistically valid, including compliance rates,  reductions in pollution characterized as to risk, recidivism, contamination incidents, and other tools."  OECA is therefore increasing its efforts to identify successful techniques and strategies for promoting, achieving, evaluating, and measuring environmental compliance.   At this point in the  evolution of OECA performance measurement, two of the biggest challenges are: (1) measuring the deterrent effect of inspections and enforcement; (2) measuring outcomes from compliance assistance, including attitudinal and behavioral changes, capital improvements, improved environmental management,  and reductions in pollution discharges and emissions. Specifically, this statement of work is focused on: Measuring the Deterrent Effect of Monitoring and Enforcement Law enforcement agencies have long believed that their actions have an impact beyond the person or entity that is the subject of  an enforcement action.  The conventional wisdom is that the effectiveness of a legal threat depends on the likelihood that a lawbreaker will be caught, the nature and severity of the punishments, and the speed of apprehension and punishment with increases in each dimension correlating with  increased deterrence and compliance.  Beyond specific deterrence that identifies individual violators, returns them to compliance, and motivates (deters) continuing behavior, there is the strongly-held view among law enforcers that individual enforcement actions also bring about general deterrence  of violations among other entities subject to the same or similar laws or requirements.  There is a significant body of literature about deterrence theory which examines the forces that seem to influence compliant and non-compliant behavior, and there are now a number of studies documenting and  analyzing the deterrent, motivational, and performance-related effects of compliance monitoring, enforcement, technical assistance, incentives, and other government interventions. Additional forces include market and community pressures, and corporate policy, organization, and compensation.  OECA  would benefit greatly from better understanding relationships among these factors and how to measure resultant deterrent impacts.  Knowing more about the interplay of these factors could lead to subtle-to-significant changes in how assistance, incentives, monitoring, and enforcement are targeted to  address specific environmental risks and noncompliance patterns.   This Amended Statement of Work lists 5 Tasks.  Tasks 1 and 2 were completed in calendar year 2007 by EPA's Contractor, Professor Jay Shimshack of Tufts University.  Tasks 3-5 describe new work to be initiated and completed in  calendar year 2008.  The new work is in follow-up to, and builds on, the work performed previously to accomplish Tasks 1 and 2. OBJECTIVE: The National Center for Environmental Research (NCER) of the Office of Research and Development (ORD) wishes to obtain a White Paper prepared on the  indicated topic.  A considerable body of research and an intellectual infrastructure has been focused on this topic, due in no small part to STAR funding.  The intent of this requirement shall be to summarize information currently available on the subject and present it in the form of a draft  report and full report.  The principal audiences for the paper are OECA and ORD.  NCER may also use the paper to consider future research initiatives in this and related subjects.  A secondary audience will be other EPA program offices currently engaged in developing performance measures. To  stimulate the identification, discussion, and implementation of new ideas and insights to measure the deterrent effect of monitoring and enforcement and compliance assistance outcomes, ORD, in collaboration with OECA, is initiating the Compliance and Deterrence Research and Workshop Project.    Through this Project, ORD and OECA seek to improve the quality and effectiveness of EPA's compliance and enforcement efforts by improving how the Agency measures the deterrent effect of monitoring and enforcement and compliance assistance outcomes. NEW TASKS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2008  Tasks 1 and 2  were completed in calendar year 2007.  The Contractor shall perform the following three new Tasks in calendar year 2008:  Task 3:  Identify two new, simplified, quantitative database analyses capable of capturing specific deterrence and general deterrence effects, respectively, in a scientifically  rigorous yet efficient manner. Task 4:  For 4-6 additional industry sectors identified by OECA in consultation with the Contractor, undertake necessary dataset preparation needed to run the models and determine parameters of general and specific deterrence based upon the simplified models  developed under Task 3. Task 5: Train OECA's personnel on how to use the models, in-house, to conduct future specific and general deterrence measurement in multiple settings.

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) PMA-275 intends to award a Task Order modification on a Sole-Source basis under BOA N00019-05-G-0008 to Raytheon Technical Services Corporation (RTSC) to provide services and products in the areas of V-22 Mission Planning System (VMPS), and Cabin Situational Awareness Upgrade (CSAU). This effort requires intricate knowledge of avionics systems, V-22 avionics simulation software, V-22 avionics laboratories, and related products used by the V-22 platform, which is poised for three key program milestones - Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for MV-22 occurring in FY08, Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) for CV-22, also occurring in FY08, and CV-22 IOC in FY09.  RTSC is the only known source that has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise required to execute the following efforts without significantly impacting schedule and cost constraints of the program: 

(A) V-22 Mission Planning System (VMPS).  RTSC will perform the VMPS aspects of correcting V-22 Problem Reports (VPR) 1570, (VPR) 1573, and (VPR) 954, as described in Work Package 219. VMPS will be changed to enable definition of and mission planning using up to 999 waypoints vs. the current 255. This includes increasing the number of characters in the waypoint tag from 5 to 8. This also includes providing the capability to checksum verify the integrity of the upload data files being loaded on a mission data cartridge. This work will be performed in conjunction with the aircraft software suite development and test for Fleet delivery in 2009.
 
(B)  Cabin Situational Awareness Upgrade (CSAU).  RTSC will provide engineering and technical analyses to evaluate the results of the Shielded Hangar tests.  RTSC will develop a solution to the anomalies found during Shielded Hangar tests and verify through testing the CSAD upgrade.  RTSC will produce and deliver up to an additional twelve (12) mission kits that include the Aircraft Wiring mission kit and CSAU/GPS Repeater mission kit.  The additional twelve (12) mission kits shall incorporate the CSAD Upgrade in paragraph 3.1.9.  RTSC will update and submit Acceptance Test Procedures, document number 794hnd0000-5700 (IAW CDRL 521) if required.  Mission kits will be tested with results included in the Acceptance Test Report (IAW CDRL A522). RTSC will produce and deliver one (1) part number 794HN420 assembly and ship to NAS Patuxent River, MD for PAX test aircraft.

The Navy intends to award a Sole-Source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee and Firm Fixed Price Task Order modification for this requirement.  The estimated period of performance is from 01 April 2008 through 31 December 2008.  The estimated issue date for this modification is 01 April 2008.  This synopsis is for information purposes only.*****

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a sole source Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)/Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to Alaska Aerospace Development Corporation (AADC), Anchorage, AK, for spaceport facilities, range services, communications and/or equipment as required to support Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) vehicle launches at the Kodiak Launch Complex in Kodiak, Alaska.  



The proposed contract is a follow-on award to MDA Contract HQ0006-03-D-0043 with AADC for BMDS support at the KLC.  The current contract's period of performance expires on August 31, 2008.  The anticipated award date for the proposed contract is August 31, 2008 to ensure no break in service.  The estimated period of performance is five years: one two-year base and three one-year options.  The estimated contract value is $100M.

 

The service is being considered for sole source on the basis of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), which states that 'When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source ... and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.'  The KLC's unique combination of geography and capability is unavailable at any other land-based location in the Northern Region of the BMDS Pacific Test Bed.  There are no other options currently available for long-range target launches from Northern Pacific for specific engagement scenarios.  AADC has management authority of the KLC per Alaska Statute, and removal of AADC as KLC operator would require a change to the Alaskan Legislation.  Award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirement.



Numbered Note 22 Applies.

<DESC>PLEASE NOTE: SSA will issue a revised solicitation on or about February 22, 2008.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to issue a solicitation, set-aside for small business participation only, to obtain the services of one to five experienced, licensed Rheumatologists, who are board certified and/or have SSA disability program experience at the State and/or Federal level, or in the absence of board certification, have SSA disability program experience combined with specialized training, to serve as Medical Experts to analyze and provide expert advice related to their specialized field, as needed, so that adjudicators can render accurate determinations and decisions.  

BACKGROUND:  SSA is responsible for two national disability programs, Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).  SSA uses a five-step sequential process for evaluating the disability claim submitted by an individual who alleges an inability to perform substantial gainful activity (SGA).  The program defines disability as an inability to engage in SGA by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death, or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.  A medical basis for the disability claim is required, and the State disability determination services (DDS) collect and evaluate the medical information, making a determination about the severity of the medical and/or rheumatic impairment as it relates to the claimant?s ability to perform SGA.  

While many disability impairments may be properly evaluated by medical generalist, claims that involve difficult or complex issues require medical and/or rheumatology specialist and sub-specialist expertise. 
SSA anticipates the award of one or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts, with provisions for the issuance of Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) task orders as needed.  The IDIQ period of performance will be for a 12-month base period, with four 12-month option periods.   SSA?s estimated date for release of the solicitation is on/about February 22, 2008, of which proposals will be due approximately 20 days from the date of release.   Any amendments or other information relative to the solicitation will be posted to this website (www.fedbizopps.gov).  As such, interested sources are encouraged to REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION.  Hard copies of the solicitation and any related information will NOT be provided.  NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  All questions must be submitted via email to s.kyle.roberts@ssa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<ARCHDATE>05092008
<CONTACT>Carol A. Williams, 503-808-4634
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has developed and demonstrated a juvenile salmon acoustic telemetry system (JSATS) consisting of acoustic micro-transmitters (tags) and autonomous, cabled, and portable/mobile acoustic receivers that meet its needs for evaluating the survival of juvenile salmonids migrating through the Columbia River Federal Hydropower System (FCRPS).   These receivers have been deployed at large hydro-electric dams, free flowing sections of the FCRPS as well as the estuary of the Columbia River.  The JSATS receivers utilize either omni-directional or user defined directional hydrophones that consist of a piezoelectric element, shielded amplifier, non-conductive case, and underwater connector; the assembly is able to withstand a nd function at static pressure up to 600K Pa absolute.  This acoustic system has a center frequency at 416.7 KHz.    Specifications for hydrophone directivity and receive sensitivity at 416.7 KHz TBD. Present estimate of minimum acceptable (on axis) receiv e sensitivity at the indicated frequency is -180 dBV//?Pa ? 2 dBV.  To meet the future requirements of juvenile salmon research study plans beginning in 2009 the USACE intends to award a 1 year (with 4 option years) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity fixed-price contract for the procurement of omni- and directional hydrophone assemblies that meet its specification requirements.  The solicitation (RFQ) outlining these specifications will be posted on/or about 14 March 2008.

<DESC>This is a revised sources sought only seeking responses from Small Businesses?.

This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of the sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified Small Businesses and their size classifications (i.e., HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned, Veteran-Owned, and Small Disadvantaged Business) relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code.  Teaming is encouraged.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only.   If you already responded to the Sources Sought dated 1/25/08 you do not need to submit another response.

Project Title has changed:  From  -- National and Regional System for the Application of Prevention Technologies (NR-SAPT) To ? Center for the Application of Prevention Technologies (CAPT)

Project Description:
The goal of this project is to implement and manage the Center for the Application of Prevention Technologies (CAPT) to provide targeted training and technical assistance (T/TA) for grantees of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP), to implement all five steps and two cross-cutting principles of SAMHSA?s Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) and accountability systems for performance measurement and management.  SAMHSA/CSAP grantees include:  States, Jurisdictions and Federally-recognized Tribal entities supported under SAMHSA?s Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant Program and  CSAP?s Programs of Regional and National Significance (PRNS) including, but not limited to:  42 Strategic Prevention Framework State Incentive Grant (SPF SIG) Program grantees; approximately 150  Minority/AIDS/HIV Prevention Initiative grantees; approximately 12  Methamphetamine Prevention Initiative grantees; and, 23 epidemiological work groups supported by SAMHSA in non-SPF SIG States.

The focus of this procurement will be to develop, implement and manage a T/TA delivery system that balances core coordination and analytic capacity at the national level with service delivery capacity in each of the five designated regions of the National Prevention Network (NPN). 

The purpose of the national core of this system is to provide centralized direction, monitoring of service quality and responsiveness to clients, evaluation of service impacts, coordination and analytic capabilities. The national core will connect to five separate Regionally-based Expert Teams to establish a coordinated training and technical assistance system aimed at building the capacity of SAMHSA/CSAP grantees and the capabilities of the prevention workforce.    The purpose of the Regionally-based Expert Teams is to conduct ongoing assessment of the T/TA needs of the SAMHSA/CSAP grantees located within each respective Region and deliver targeted and timely T/TA services to assist grantees in achieving their specific program objectives and benchmarks.  Regionally-based expert teams will consist of staff, associates, and consultants who are currently established in their respective Regions and have existing professional T/TA relationships with those States, Jurisdictions, Tribal organizations and other relevant entities within the Region. 

Your responses to the questions provided below will assist the Government in selecting the appropriate acquisition method. Page limit: Maximum 11 pages (font size 10 or larger). A copy of the company capability statement will also be accepted.

The DMX400 magnet was manufactured by Magnex Scientific; the 7T/30 magnet is from Bruker Biospin and the ABX magnet is from Oxford Instruments.


1.2 Description of the New Facility and Location 

The NIH Biomedical Research Center (BRC) is a replacement facility for a portion of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  The NIA?s Intramural Research program (IRP) is located primarily on the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center campus in Baltimore, MD in various buildings.  The magnets involved will be relocated to the Basement level (level 0) of the BRC.

An air shaft has been constructed on the outside of the new building leading to the Basement level. Due to the size and weight of the 7T/30 magnet, the delivery of the magnet can only be done through this shaft.  Both the DMX and the ABX 1.9T magnets should fit in the freight elevator once crated.
     
  The following table shows approximate elevator dimensions and capacities in the BRC:

	Passenger Elevators	Freight Elevators
Door Dimensions	3?-6? x 7?-0?	4?-6? x 7?-0?
Inside Dimensions of Cab	Need to verify	Need to verify
Weight Capacity	3,500 lbs.	6,500 lbs.
Site measurements will need to be taken by the Contractor.

1.3 Service Requirement Overview

?	Due to the sensitivity of the equipment, a knowledgeable contractor and means of effective communication shall be required to ensure the requirements are met.  The Contract support teams must be skilled and precise in relocating large, sensitive MRI and NMR magnets.  All NIH contracts shall be treated with the highest levels of professionalism especially when directly interacting with the Move Coordinator and NIH staff in the workplace as well as with researchers in the laboratories.

?	Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, vehicles, equipment, licenses, permits, insurances, subcontracts, management, expertise and other resources necessary to transport government owned property between the two locations.

The contractor must be able to schedule up to a month before the actual move and respond in a timely manner.  The sequence of this move is dependent on several time sensitive factors that will be coordinated by the Move Coordinator and NIH.

1.4	Schedule Overview

Rigging services will commence once the Faraday cages for the ABX 1.9T/30 and 7T/30 instruments are in place and have been tested. 

Unlike at the GRC, all three magnets will be relocated to an open floor plan and will all be housed in one room. A floor plan of the new layout will be provided. 

Due to the existing location of the 7T/30 in the GRC building, a large crane will probably need to park on a Johns Hopkins emergency route on Nathan Shock Drive. To minimize disturbance to activities on the hospital campus, work will need to be performed early in the morning on a weekend. NIH will make the appropriate arrangements with Johns Hopkins security concerning road closures/detours. Johns Hopkins does not provide flaggers; this shall be provided by the contractor.

An up-to-date underground utilities plan for the roadway separating the BRC from the GRC and the roadway in front of ARC and NIDA will be provided to the Contractor in order to plan the location of heavy equipment so as not to endanger buried utilities.




					








    SECTION 2
SCOPE OF WORK

2.1	Pre-Move:

?	In cooperation with the Move coordinator and Lab Manager, the Contractor shall develop and submit a relocation plan. 
?	The Move Coordinator shall provide the confirmed schedule to the Contractor two weeks prior to the move.
?	The Contractor shall verify all site conditions prior to the move. If any concerns arise, the Contractor must notify the Move Coordinator and Lab Manager two weeks prior to the move.
?	The magnets will be completely de-energized, secured and crated under separate contracts with their respective manufacturers or third-party contractors, as appropriate for each magnet.    

2.2      Move:

?	The Contractor shall provide all materials and supplies required for packaging/crating the 1.9T magnet.  Bruker will prepare and pack the 7T/30 and DMX 400.
?	The DMX 400 and 1.9T magnets can be crated and removed from their current locations via the GRC?s hallways, freight elevators and loading dock.
?	The 7T/30 magnet will need to be lifted out of an existing roof hatch located on the outside of the GRC building on the patio separating the GRC and ARC buildings.
?	During transportation, as recommended by Bruker, the magnet is lifted by the packing crate, using either a fork lift or crane. The Contractor shall provide forklift trucks capable of lifting more than 7000 Kg.  Any crane and equipment used to move the magnet must have a safe working load equal to, or greater than, 7000 kg minimum. Lifting and lowering must be carried out slowly, smoothly and in a controlled fashion.  Driving also must be at a slow speed. 
?	The Contractor shall move the system on air pads, but if unavailable, skates may be used. If skates are used, the surface must be leveled, which may mean laying plates on the floor before moving the magnet.  The system must be supported on the pads under the feet of the cryostat.  This must be carried out by experienced personnel. The system must not be allowed to fall off the pad or skate, but must be gently lowered to the floor.
Bending of support constructions and inclines by more than 2 mm must be avoided.
 In the new location the Faraday cages will be built with removable panels to allow the magnet to be moved in horizontally. Per specifications, the 7T/30 magnet cannot be tilted more than 3 degrees during movement. 

2.4 	PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND OVERALL SUPERVISION

After award, an orientation/kick-off meeting with the Contractor(s) will be scheduled with the Move Coordinator and the Lab Manager.  The agenda for the orientation meeting is to include but is not limited to: communication and coordination responsibilities and procedures, finalizing master move plan, proposed project schedule and scheduling required for future meetings.

Qualifications

Qualified personnel shall be provided by the Contractor to accomplish the tasks listed herein.  All contractor personnel involved in handling and the transporting the magnets must be familiar with Bruker magnets or similar equipment and have experience moving cold (cryogen-filled) superconducting NMR or MRI magnets of similar weight and size.

2.5 GENERAL DUTIES AND REQUIREMENTS

 General Handling and Lifting Procedures:
  
(7T/30) per Bruker
The Bruker USR magnets are designed to be sufficiently strong and to be shipped without disassembly and in cold condition, thus the strength is optimized so as not to affect the cryogenic performance.  However, care must be exercised when handing the magnet since abnormal forces due to faulty careless handling practices may damage the system.
All lifting and moving of the magnet containing cryogenic gases (liquid cryogens) must be carried out by trained personnel and under no circumstances may the system be dropped or skidded along the floor because these actions may damage the magnet system.
The magnet must be moved in an upright position by using appropriate transportation means.  When moving the magnet it shall not be tilted more than 3 degrees.
With any type of movement the resulting acceleration forces must be smaller than 2.0g.  When movement occurs in the vertical direction alone, forces up to 3.0g can be tolerated.  However, in such cases no acceleration whatsoever may be experienced simultaneously in another direction.

The system must not impact other objects when traversing. The transport lugs should not experience any lateral forces.

Road Transportation

?	The magnet must be transported on air ride trucks only
?	The magnet must be completely de-energized
?	The magnet system must be secured by the transport rod which is screwed into the helium neck
?	Each He-exhaust-port must be sealed with a 20 mbar non return (one-way safety exhaust) valve
?	2g- and 5g- shock indicators must be rigidly attached to the cryostat.
?	The magnet system must be placed on the motor vehicle.  MUST NOT BE PLACED ON THE TRAILER
?	The axis of the magnet bore must be perpendicular to the direction of travel of the truck
?	The cryomagnet system must be safely secured against slippage
?	The cryomagnet system must be safely secured against tilting
?	The cryomagnet system must be safely protected against accidental collision with any other part of the load on the truck

Due to the sensitivity of the 7T/30 and the supporting equipment, the contractor shall specify in the proposal how to overcome four potential pitfalls: 
?	The magnet will need to be transported over an 8? threshold at the entry doors of the BRC, located at the bottom of the access shaft.
?	The magnet will need to be moved horizontally through the delivery panel of the new Faraday cage, which has a 1.5? step up from the floor slab to the cage floor.  Note any special design features (e.g. overhead beams, lifting points, etc.) that may need be built into the new Faraday cage to allow access for magnet delivery.
?	Relocating the APC UPS associated with the 7T/30 without taking down any walls in the GRC.
?	Removing the HX-300 chiller out of the GRC basement
(ABX)	
Specific Handling instructions will be provided 

(DMX)
Specific Handling instructions will be provided
Security Requirements

The Contractor shall take precautions to ensure that the security of all NIH personnel, research programs, facilities, property, data, record and materials are not jeopardized by contract operations.

Johns Hopkins Security requirements will be provided to the contractor

Insurance  (see Attachment 1)


2.6  Site
Site access requirements and restrictions are as follows: 
?	While on NIH installations, the Contractor vehicles shall be parked only in areas designated for such vehicles by the NIA IRP Security Officers and Johns Hopkins campus police.               
?	Drivers shall not drink, eat or smoke while operating vehicles on NIH installations nor drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

The Contractor crew shall only use designated elevators for the movement of shipping containers between building floors.

<SOLNBR>HSBP1008R1590
<RESPDATE>030608
<ARCHDATE>03062008
<CONTACT>Stephanie Alexander, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-344-2327, Fax 202-344-3322, Email Stephanie.Alexander@dhs.gov - Susan Baptist, Contracting Officer, Phone 202/344-1223, Fax 202/344-1254, Email Susan.Baptist@dhs.gov
<DESC>This acquisition will be in support of Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Office of CBP Air and Marine.  CBP intends to procure Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Predator B aircraft, aircraft equipment, engineering and logistics, and operational and maintenance support services on a sole source basis to General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI), 16761 Via Del Campo Court, San Diego, CA  92127.  This requirement further consist of procuring air vehicle operators and mission payload operators, systems airframe and equipment repairs/modification, system upgrades or engineering changes, software support services, air vehicle and mission equipment systems integration, training, material and equipment support issues resolution and technical support services, maintaining support of ground station facilities, material and equipment procurement services, and data development and documentation.  

General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI) provides unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) aircraft, equipment and services to CBP under HSBP1005D00994.  GA-ASI is the only manufacturer of the MQ-9 Predator B, the UAS currently deployed by CBP.  Because the MQ-9 Predator B is proprietary to GA-ASI, no other company can produce this particular aircraft nor can any other company support, operate, and maintain the CBP program at the anticipated levels that are forecasted for the future.  The Predator B cannot be procured from any other source, and the attempt to transition the support services for the Predator B to a company other than GA-ASI would be impractical.  No other company has the capacity like GA-ASI nor the knowledge to support the UAS program that CBP has developed.  GA-ASI knowledge of the operation and maintenance of the Predator B is unique as well as their knowledge of CBP UAS program.  The acquisition of any other system and services irreparably impact the CBP UAS program, cause a decrease in security at the Nations borders and cause costly delays in the CBP UAS deployment schedule.  Based on these reasons, and combined with unchanged CBP UAS operational requirements as well as CBP A&Ms own ongoing research of the UAS market, GA-ASI is the one responsible source for the UAS aircraft equipment and support services required by CBP and no other supplies or services will satisfy these requirements.

In August 2005, CBP awarded GA-ASI a contract for four (4) Predator B UASs.  The award was based on a competitive procurement process during which the GA-ASI Predator B, with its long duration, high altitude, and persistent surveillance capability, as well as expanded payload capabilities and an agile transportability feature, emerged as the one system that met all of CBPs operational requirements.  Due to the lack of a government infrastructure to support a UAS system, GA-ASI installed, integrated, operated, and continues to operate and maintain the Predator B for CBP.

The Predator B provides the following Level I requirements:
- Remotely piloted vehicle that meets FAA control restrictions
- Capable of long range surveillance and intelligence gathering, endurance
       o Flexible C3ISR
       o 2200 lb payload capacity
       o 30 hour flight time
       o Pilot in the loop
- Capable of providing direct support for ground interdiction
- Meets stringent FAA requirements for a COA; acceptable level of safety
       o FAA review of requirements for a COA; acceptable level of safety
       o Only UAS to receive FAA approval of Air Worthiness Statement (November 2006)
       o Extensive Ground and Flight Testing
- Only UAS proven in the NAS 
- Payload capacity makes it capable of supporting growth in sensor technology
- U.S. military applications of the Predator B enable CBP to leverage inter-agency technology, training, logistics and maintenance support
- GA-ASI integrated, and currently operates and maintains the Predator B for CBP

GA-ASI UAS aircraft and equipment have had to meet CBP UAS performance measures (e.g., system availability rates) and its support services have had to meet service contract requirements. GA-ASI continues to meet or exceed CBP requirements in performance and reliability.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grants CBP A&M a Certificate of Authorization (COA) for Predator B operations to fly in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS), in part because of its safety record operating within the NAS.  In fact, the Predator B has more hours within the NAS than any other airframe.

GA-ASI successfully and satisfactorily supports CBP UAS operations.  A service provider other than GA-ASI would lack commonality with the currently deployed CBP UAS and cause a lengthy operation downtime during testing, selection, and transition phases, as well as a reinvestment for integration and training.  The unavoidable grounding of Predator B operations during transition would mean a significant interruption in support to CBP agents in the southwest border region, a decrease in CBPs ability to support its in homeland security, and a costly in CBPs northern border expansion efforts,

Since taking delivery of CBP 104 in September 2006, the GA-ASI Predator B has been a force multiplier for CBP.  During 2006 and 2007, Predator Bs flew approximately 2,000 hours in support of CBP southwest border security missions.  This flexible and responsive system will also allow CBP to coordinate with organizations that share similar missions, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of Defense (DoD).  CBP A&M works with the DoD to gain efficiencies in acquisition, testing, training and deployment of the Predator B.

GA-ASI Predator Bs provide unique and specialized intelligence gathering, surveillance and tactical support to CBP agents on the ground in the southwest border region and will add much needed support to northern border operations.  CBP UAS operations must continue uninterrupted; this is only possible with the UAS aircraft equipment and ongoing support services of GA-ASI.

GA-ASI is the sole capable prime contractor for the UAS Predator B Program.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact GA-ASI directly.  See Numbered Note 22.

CROSS REFERENCE MARKET RESEARCH HSFLGL08R00006.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, THERE WILL BE NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE FOR DOWNLOAD FOR THIS ACTION.  FIRMS MUST RESPOND BY SUBMISSION OF COMPLETED STANDARD FORM 330, ARCHITECT ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS NO LATER THAN 4:00 P.M., 30 DAYS FROM DATE OF THIS NOTICE, AS OUTLINED HEREIN:  

Architectural-Engineering Services are required to provide Engineering, Planning, Design and Post Construction Award Services for Department of Homeland Security, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) projects.  Projects will be executed in the FLETC locations of Glynco, Georgia (adjacent to Brunswick, Georgia); Artesia, New Mexico; Cheltenham, Maryland; and Charleston, South Carolina.   The requirement will also encompass future Federal Law Enforcement Training Center locations, which may be established within the 50 United States.

Services shall be secured by issuing individual delivery orders against a minimum of three multiple-award, multi-discipline contracts at each of the FLETC locations: 1) Artesia, NM; 2) Cheltenham, MD; and 3) Glynco, GA/Charleston, SC (considered a single location for this acquisition).  Scopes of work require a multi-discipline approach including, but not limited to, architectural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection, structural, civil, environmental, and other disciplines as required to conduct/execute field surveys, site and subsurface soil investigations, charrettes and concept/pre-design studies, program development, building and utility system investigations and evaluations, provide design/construction documents and construction cost estimates, post construction award review and management services, quality assurance, value engineering reviews, and other related services of the listed project types.

The FLETC provides the requisite support and service facilities to establish and maintain a state-of-the-art law enforcement training facility.  Such facilities may include, but are not limited to, indoor firing ranges, automobile driver training ranges, student dormitories, office buildings, classroom buildings, physical techniques training facilities, conference facilities (including auditorium and food service), parking structures, campus utility systems and roadway infrastructure, storm drainage structures, hazardous material storage facilities, and central utility plants.  Projects may include, but are not limited to, new construction and/or major renovation and modernization of:  (1) Classroom Buildings (All locations, ranging in size from 50,000 to 270,000 gross sq.ft.), (2) Driver Training Ranges and associated facilities (All locations), (3) Indoor Firearms Ranges (All locations), (4) Steam&/or Chilled Water Distribution System Improvements (Glynco), (5) Physical Techniques Facility (All locations), (6) Practical Exercise Facilities (All locations), (7) Dormitory/Student Housing (Glynco/Charleston & Artesia), (8) Utilities Upgrades to include  power, water, and/or sanitary sewer distribution systems (All locations), (9) Office Buildings (All locations)  (10) Roadway networks (All locations) and, (11) Cafeteria Renovation (All locations).  

It is anticipated that there will be a minimum of three basic contracts awarded for each of the three FLETC locations outlined herein, for a minimum of nine awards.  However, the Government reserves the right to award as many contracts as deemed appropriate per location based on the responses to this announcement.  The Government will utilize the procedures outlined in FAR Part 36, as supplemented, to competitively secure services of the most highly qualified firms, as determined by the A-E Evaluation board using the selection criteria outlined herein.    Initial selection and award will not be project specific.   Each contract will be a multi-discipline, indefinite delivery-indec.   Each contract will be a multi-discipline, indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity type contract.  After the basic contracts have been awarded, delivery orders will be placed on an intermittent, ?as required,? basis to the most highly qualified firm as determined by review of SF330s on file of the basic contract A-E firms, which will be updated, at a minimum, annually.   However, firms are not restricted from submitting revised SF330s as firm conditions change.

Should a subsequent delivery order require special services or disciplines that are not included in the basic award, the Government reserves the right to request each basic contract awarded A-E firm, within the applicable regional contract pool, to advise if the firm is interested in being considered for the specific project.  The request will be accompanied by a copy of the scope of services, an estimated construction cost, and evaluation and award factors for the specific project, if different from that used in the initial selection process.  Typically, the time frame for this response will be 7 to 14 calendar days. The firms will be required to submit a revised SF 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications, Part I, if interested, and outline the disciplines required to accomplish the specific requirement.  Upon receipt of responses, the submissions will be reviewed and the firm deemed the most highly qualified firm as determined by the Government will be solicited for a price proposal for the project. 

As of this date, each basic contract will include a base contract period of one (1) year or $1,000,000.00 in fees, with the possibility of four (4) one-year option periods, or $1,000,000.00 in fees per option period, whichever occurs first.  The options will be exercised only if found to be in the Government?s best interest (subject to workload and/or satisfaction of A-E performance).   The total contract value for each contract will not exceed $5,000,000.00 for the contract life.  The minimum and maximum design service fee for each subsequent delivery order will range between $5,000.00 and $500,000.00.  There will be a guaranteed minimum of $10,000.00 for the life of each basic contract awarded.  Some relatively small projects, with quick turnaround times, should be anticipated by successful firms.

Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms may be required to work with a Construction Manager (at risk) (CMc) firm at the completion of the Schematic Design Phase stage.  A-E firms must agree to accept a relationship of trust and confidence and covenants with the Government to furnish the A-E?s reasonable skill and judgment and to cooperate with the Construction Manager Contractor in furthering the interests of the Government.  Use of CMc approach will be identified in each follow-on delivery order, if required.

The purpose of this procurement is to select firms highly qualified to provide these A-E services.  Due to the variety of projects anticipated, the selected firms must possess a wide range of professional services in-house for matters of expediency and quality with considerable experience in architecture and engineering for the law enforcement training facilities and the general types of facilities listed above.  Design teams will be required to demonstrate considerable experience in designing firing ranges, driver training ranges, gymnasiums, classroom buildings, dormitories, food service facilities, roadways and various utility distribution systems.  Experience must include an in-depth knowledge of related complex small arms ranges to include targetry and ballistic materials and classrooms with audiovisual systems.

This is a voluntary program, however the Government shall consider the extent to which an offeror demonstrates current, or recently initiated, enrollment and current, or planned participation in the E-Verify program, or any other successor program managed by DHS, during the evaluation of proposals.  Firms will not be evaluated on an absolute standard, but rather the Government shall attribute more significance to offeror participation for an entire workforce versus participation only for single, or multiple, discrete workforce segments.  Contractors not currently or planning participation will be given a neutral rating of this sub-factor in the evaluation of their response to this solicitation.  Firms may register for the E-Verify Program on-line at:  https://www.vis-dhs.com/employerregistration/. This site provides instructions for completing the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for official registration in the Program. Offerors may obtain additional information about E-Verify by visiting the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS) website at: http://www.DHS.GOV/E-VERIFY or calling the USCIS at 1 (888) 464-4218.

The Government anticipates awarding at least fifty percent of the basic contracts to highly qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms, i.e., if five contracts are awarded, at least three firms are expected to be SDVOSB concerns, or if six contracts are awarded, at least three firms are expected to be SDVOSB concerns.   It is anticipated that the remaining fifty percent of the awards will be issued on an unrestricted basis.   The final composition will be based on the quality and number of responses received from the SDVOSB concerns.  However, should insufficient response be received from qualified SDVOSB Concerns, 100% of the action will proceed on an unrestricted basis.  However, the Government will reserve the right to set-aside one award to an 8(a) firm, dependent on results from synopsis for slate/select.

Firms are advised that as required by FAR 52.219-9, a large business successful offeror will be required to submit for approval, a subcontracting plan outlining which portions of the work subcontracted are to be awarded to Small Businesses; Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Historically Underutilized Zone Small Business (HUBZone), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), and Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB).  This plan is not required with the submission of the SF330, but an acceptable subcontracting plan must be agreed upon prior to contract award to any large business.  However, firms must address small business subcontracting criteria in the SF330, Block 30.  Failure to submit and negotiate the subcontracting plan shall make the offeror ineligible for award of a contract.  

The Department of Homeland Security has assigned goals expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars for utilization of small businesses of 40.0%.  Included in the SB goals are targets for:  SDB (including Historically Black College/Universities/Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI)) - 5.0%; WOSB ? 5%; HUBZone - 3.0%; and SDVOSB -3.0%.  

The selected A-E firm will be required to provide overhead, profit, and discipline hourly rates to the Contracting Officer within seven (7) days after receiving notice of selection.

Contractors not currently or planning participation will be given a neutral rating of this sub-factor in the evaluation of their response to this solicitation.  Firms may register for the E-Verify Program on-line at:  https://www.vis-dhs.com/employerregistration/. This site provides instructions for completing the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for official registration in the Program. Offerors may obtain additional information about E-Verify by visiting the U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS) website at: http://www.DHS.GOV/E-VERIFY or calling the USCIS at 1 (888) 464-4218.

The Government anticipates awarding at least fifty percent of the basic contracts to highly qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms, i.e., if five contracts are awarded, at least three firms are expected to be SDVOSB concerns, or if six contracts are awarded, at least three firms are expected to be SDVOSB concerns.   It is anticipated that the remaining fifty percent of the awards will be issued on an unrestricted basis.   The final composition will be based on the quality and number of responses received from the SDVOSB concerns.  However, should insufficient response be received from qualified SDVOSB Concerns, 100% of the action will proceed on an unrestricted basis.  However, the Government will reserve the right to set-aside one award to an 8(a) firm, dependant on results from synopsis for slate/select.

Firms are advised that as required by FAR 52.219-9, a large business successful offeror will be required to submit for approval, a subcontracting plan outlining which portions of the work subcontracted is to be awarded to Small Businesses; Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Historically Underutilized Zone Small Business (HUBZone), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), and Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB).  This plan is not required with the submission of the SF330, but an acceptable subcontracting plan must be agreed upon prior to contract award to any large business.  However, firms must address small business subcontracting criteria in the SF330, Block 30.  Failure to submit and negotiate the subcontracting plan shall make the offeror ineligible for award of a contract.  

The Department of Homeland Security has assigned goals expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars for utilization of small businesses of 40.0%.  Included in the SB goals are targets for:  SDB (including Historically Black College/Universities/Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI)) - 5.0%; WOSB ? 5%; HUBZone - 3.0%; and SDVOSB -3.0%.  

The selected A-E firm will be required to provide overhead, profit, and discipline hourly rates to the Contracting Officer within seven (7) days after receiving notice of selection.

Primary NAICS Codes 541330 and 541310, Size Standard $4.5 million.  However, other NAICS in the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services may be applicable for a specific project.  All responses are to be sent in hard copy within 30 calendar days of the date of this notice to Department of Homeland Security; Federal Law Enforcement Training Center; 1131 Chapel Crossing Road; Glynco, GA 31524; Attn:  JoDeen Cuffe; Procurement Division, Bldg 93.  Additional information relative to the above specific projects is not available and requests for same will not be considered.  Site visit will not be conducted during the submittal period.

<DESC>*****THIS REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN CANCELLED*****
Contract N00019-05-C-0051 is currently in place with Diagnostics Solutions, Jacksonville, NC, logistics, technical and data management services in support of the CH-46E helicopter Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System (AIMS).  The current AIMS accumulates vibration and performance data during ground and flight operations which then checked for exceedences that will drive corrective actiction maintenance actions.  Due to the high utilization rates for the CH-46E helicopter operating in support of the Global War on terrorism, the data is accumulating much faster than expected.  As such, two additional man-years are required under the existing contract to keep up with demand.  Diagnostics Solutions is the only company to possess the epertise and knowledge of the CH-46 AIMS that is required to continue this effort without unacceptable delays and dupliation of costs.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price modicification to contract N00019-05-C-0051 to increase the current level of effort.  The period of performance for this additional work will be a three (3) month base period with one 12 month option.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to enter into negotiations on a non-competitive basis with DME Corporation located in Orlando, FL. The Government intends to procure Interim Spare and Repair Parts required to support initial fielding of H-60 Hybrid Test Station (HTS) Lot II Offload to Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) Operational Test Program Sets (OTPS) 02 ON677/USM636(V) and H60 OTPS 03 ON672/USM636(V) in December 2008, under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The HTS spare parts are required to support the CASS OTPSs, which are being designed and developed by DME Corporation. Although a complete technical data package for these OTPSs is a part of the design phase, the Government will not take delivery of this technical data package early enough to support competitive procurement of these interim spare and repair parts. Initial fielding of the CASS OTPSs is scheduled for December 2008; therefore, spares to accommodate the fielding of the initial OTPSs will be required in September 2008.

<DESC>The following are vendor questions and the Government's responses: QUESTION:  What is involved with this contract and what geographic areas are involved? We are interested in contracting but need more information. ANSWER:  Please see page 6, B.2 Schedule of Items/Costs, for geographic locations, and page 9, B.32 Statement of Work. QUESTION:  I have a few questions regarding the  solicitation which are as follows:  Page 28  C.9.52-222-42 STATEMENT OF EQUIVALENT RATES FOR FEDERAL HIRES -Question:  Am I correct in my understanding that although the clause indicates that it is not providing a wage determination it is stating that the contracting agency is expected to pay the wage and fringe benefits that are not less than what is indicated here?  I am trying to determine how best to use the information provided in the clause because it says these are the wages and benefits expected to be paid but also states it is not a wage determination.  ANSWER:  Please see page 31 of the solicitation for DOL Wage Determination No. 2005-2401 (REV. 4), dated August 7, 2007.   QUESTION:  How many hours constitute a visit? ANSWER:  A visit is minimally one hour and maximum of 6 - 8 hours. QUESTION:  Regarding Solicitation Number VA-246-08-RP-0011, we are not accredited or Medicare certified.  It states in the bid that you must have at least Medicare/State Certification.  However, we have North Carolina Home Care Agency "Licensure", not certification.  Will a North Carolina Home Care Agency License suffice?  Please clarify. ANSWER:  Amendment 1 to the solicitation will be issued stating the following: Paragraph 15(b), on page 18 of the solicitation, is DELETED in its entirety.

Proposals with new and inno vati ve technologies are needed which could enhance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge for the following areas:     Proposals should address one of the technical areas listed:     A:     INTERCEPTOR TECHNOLOGIES, 1. Interceptor Systems, 2. Threa t Negation Sys tems, 3. Simulation and Modeling Systems, 4. Command, Control & Communications Systems, 5. Networks, 6. System Interoperability, 7. System Requirements, 8. Other Applicable Interceptor Applied Technology Systems, and B:       DEFENSE INFRAST RUCTURE TECHNOLOGIE S (AIR, CRUISE MISSILE, ARMOR, FORCE PROTECTION AND OTHER), 1. Interceptor Systems, 2. Integrated Missile Systems, 3. Simulation and Modeling,     4. Target Systems, 5. Transportation Systems, 6. System Operational Analysis, 7. Battle M anagement Systems, 8. F ire Control Systems, 9. Directed Energy Systems, 10. Other Applicable Defense Infrastructure Applied Technologies.     All development activities related to this BAA are subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).    Performance will require ac cess to and/or generation of technical data the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, Executive Order 12470, and/or DOD Directive 5230.25.     This acquisition is not open to foreign firms.     Any con tractor or subcontractor considering this BAA can not have foreign nationals working on the effort. Foreign Nationals (also known as foreign persons) means any person who is NOT a citizen or national of the US; or a lawful permanent resident; or a protecte d individual as defined by 8 U.S.C 13 24b(a)(3). In order to streamline the proposal process and to assist offerors in determining whether to incur the cost of generating a formal BAA proposal, it is requested that the offerors first submit a summary conce pt paper for evaluation. From this sum mary concept paper the Government will indicate whether the subject matter technology described is of interest to the Government and whether a formal proposal would be likely to succeed.     The Government, at its opt ion, may provide comments that might be of     assistance to the submitter in determining how or whether to submit a BAA proposal.       Concept papers will be evaluated as soon as they are received.     Acknowledgement of receipt of concept papers will no t be made, and concept papers will not be returned. The Contracting Office will ask only those offerors with promising concept papers to submit full technical and cost proposals.     The Contracting Office will notify offerors within 90 days of receipt of concept paper if a full proposal is requested.     Concept     papers not selected for full proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner that protects proprietary data.     All proprietary material should be clearly marked. The summary concept paper  should state the proposed technical concept including the ration ale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and its contribution to the USA AMRDEC.     In addition, the summary concept paper should include a period of performance, anticipated cost  and offerors past performance on Government contracts. The concept p aper shall be limited to 5 pages (8 1/2 x 11 single-spaced), of English text with one additional page for technical drawing if necessary, and shall be in MS Word for Windows format. All concept papers, proposals, written communications or documentation co ncerning this BAA shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer,     Ms. Debra Scruggs , via e-mail debra.scruggs@us.army.mil, with a copy to Ms. Camille Jones, via     e-mail camille.jones@us.army.mil.     Facsimile proposal submission is not authorized under this announcement.     No classified data shall be included in the concept paper o r proposal. A review of concept papers by the Government will determine which efforts a re of sufficient interest to merit a formal proposal.     Concept papers will be evaluated based on technical merit and offerors past performance. Technical merit will rank significantly higher than past performance. If there is sufficient interest, a formal proposal will be requested.     Contractors are not authorized to submit formal proposals unless invited to do so by the Contracting Office.     This announcement is  an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make any award or to pay fo r any response preparation costs. The cost of proposal preparation or response to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract  or any other contract and interested parties should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be p ublished. Proposals may range from theoretical studies to a proof-of-concept that includes fabrication, delivery and test of prototypes. USA AMRDEC is intere sted in receiving proposals for the research efforts described under this BAA. USA AMRDEC contracts     with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for research in those technical areas listed above.     Awards as a result of this announcement will take the form of a contract. Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee completion and/or level of effo rt type contracts are expected to be awarded.     For planning purposes, awards are anticipated in the $100K to $30M range for the basic contract wit h a period of performance not to exceed 36 months.     In addition to the basic contract, up to four options can be proposed.     However, the total contract value (of each individual contract) for the basic and options cannot exceed $75M and the total per iod of performance for the basic and options cannot exceed 60 months.     This includes time for preparation, approval,     and distribution of the final report.     The following reports may be required (specific reporting requirements will be specified b y the Government in the event a contractor is requested to submit a formal proposal):     1. FUNDS AND MAN-HOUR EXPENDITURE REPOR T, DI-FNCL-80331/M, monthly; 2. TECHNICAL REPORT, DI-MISC-80508, as required and a one time Final report; 3. STATUS REPORTS, D I-MGMT-80368, monthly; 4.

The financial portion of the proposal should contain a cost estimate that is sufficiently detailed by ele ment of cost for meaningful evaluation and must include suffici ent detail to support and explain all costs proposed, giving figures and narrative explanation.     Cost proposals must contain certifiable cost or pricing data, and shall be in sufficient detail to allow direct and indirect rate verification.     The budg et must include the total estimated cost of the project.     The estimated project costs must be broken down for each year of the program to show the following: (1)     A list of participants, not necessar ily by name, showing the time and number of direct  productive person hours (DPPHs) to be charged by principal investigator(s), research associates, and assistants, and the total amount per year to be paid to each from the project.     For proposals from unive rsities, the time and amounts to be charged sh ould be identified by academic year and summer effort. (2)     An itemized list of permanent equipment showing the cost of each item. Permanent equipment is any article of non-expendable tangible personal property     having a useful life of more than two years, and an acquisition cost of $500 or more per unit. (3)     A general description and total estimated cost of expendable equipment and supplies. (4)     Contemplated expenditures for travel with brief explanation.     Tra vel budgets that exceed $1,50 0 per principal investigator per year or that include foreign travel or travel by other than principal investigators will require special investigation. (5) Other direct costs. (6)     Cost for consulting services, if any, showing     number of days, daily  rates, and estimated travel/per diem costs.     The need for consulting services must be fully justified. (7)     Indirect costs indicating whether rates used are fixed or provisional, and the time frames to which they are applicable (e.g. , a fixed rate may apply until a specified date, after which the rate becomes provisional). (8)     The fee, if any, which the organization proposes to assess the research project. (9)     Subcontracts and material costs proposed must be fully supported and docu mented ( written quotes, engineering estimates, etc).     Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), it is the policy of the Government to enable small business concerns to be considered fairly as subcontractors to contractors perfo rmin g work or rendering services as prime contractors or subcontractors under Government contracts, and to assure that prime contractors and subcontractors carry ou t this policy. Subcontracting goals for small business are 40%, for veteran owned small busi ness 3%, for service disabled veteran owned small business 3%, Hubzone small business 3%, small disadvantaged business (includes HBCUs/MIs) 5%, and women-owned sma ll business 5%. These goals are to be considered when proposals are submitted.     The Government anticipates that any contract resulting from this BAA will be funded on an incremental basis as provided by FAR 52.232-22 Limitation of Funds.     Proposals  wi ll be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement.     The primary basis for selecting proposals for acceptance shall be technical merit, importance to agency programs, and funds availability.     Ma nagement, cost realism and reasonableness, and past performance shall also be considered.     The following factors will be considered in the evaluation of proposals received under this BAA. General: The government selection of the proposal(s) for award wi ll be based o n an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the government considering technical and management in accordance with the evaluation criteria, cost, best value considerations, availability of funds, and program balance, using the area s and factors set forth below. The Government anticipates multiple awards under this announcement, though no minimum or maximum number of awards can be guaranteed.     THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPON SES RECEIVED. Evaluation Factors for Technical Area: a. Overall Scientific/Technical Quality: The offeror will be evaluated on the overall scientific/technical merits of the proposed research and development.     The scientific/technical  merits may include po tential for state-of-the-art improvement, with special emphasis on innovation, originality and uniqueness. b. Qualifications: Capabilities and qualifications of the key research personnel relevant offeror experience and adequacy of f acilities and instrumen tation as required. The offeror shall also be evaluated on past technical performance of current similar R&D contracts. c. Research and Development Contribution: Potential contribution of the proposed research to USA AMRDEC in the a bove technology areas. E valuation Factors Management Area: a. Overall Scheduling and Planning: The offeror's approach will be evaluated based on the overall scheduling and planning for performance of the effort. b. Expenditure Control: The approach for co ntrolling expenditures an d labor hours. c. Past Performance: The offeror's past performance for similar work will be considered. Evaluation Factors Cost Area: a. Cost Realism: The proposal will be evaluated to assess the likelihood that the technical and management approaches prop osed could be accomplished at the cost proposed. b. Total Evaluated Probable Cost: The proposal will be evaluated to develop the government's estimate of the most probable cost to the government of successfully completing the con tract using the technical a nd management approaches proposed.     Relative Importance of Evaluation Criteria: 1. Technical:     The technical area is significantly more important than the management area.     The factors under the technical area are of eq ual importance. 2. Management:     The m anagement area is significantly less important than the technical area.     The factors under the management area are of equal importance. 3. Cost: Although the technical and management areas are more important than  the cost area, cost is still considered a s ignificant evaluation factor. Proposed costs must be fully detailed and have a complete justification. The total proposed cost must be within the total contract value as specified in the Introduction of this BAA . Selection of proposal(s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the government considering technical an d management in accordance with the evaluation criteria, cost, best value considerations, availability of funds, and program balance.     In som e cases the merits of a particular proposal in a technical discipline may lead to a decision with respect to fu nds availability relevant to the Applied Technolo gy Initiatives Directorate customer goals.     This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the comp etitive selection of research proposals.     Contract(s)     based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. Th is BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit     the Government to make any award or to pay for any response preparation costs.     This BAA shall remain in effect for a period of one-year from date of synopsis.<BR><BR>Point of Contact<BR>L isa Starbuck, (256) 876-3080<BR>Email your questions to US Army Aviation and Missile Command (Missile) at lisa.starbuck@us.army.mil

4. POSITION TITLE: Infrastructure Program Manager ? USAID/Kosovo
5. MARKET VALUE: $ 81,093.00 - $ 105,420.00  per annum (GS 14 ? equivalent) 
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  May 2008 ? May 2010
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo 
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 

Background:

Kosovo formally declared independence on February 17, and was immediately recognized by the US and most of the EU. While the rest of the world, for the most part, recognizes Kosovo as an independent country, some - led by Serbia and Russia - are opposed to this move, stating that this sets a dangerous precedent for other separatist movements. 

In November 2005, former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari was appointed the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the future status process for Kosovo.  After 14 months of negotiations concluded in March 2007, Mr. Ahtisaari submitted his report to the Security Council, which indicated that the irreconcilable positions of the parties had made the goal of a negotiated settlement unattainable.  Mr. Ahtisaari recommended independence for Kosovo, supervised initially by the international community.  His settlement proposal, upon which such independence is to be based, builds upon the positions of the parties in the negotiating process and offers compromises on many issues to achieve a durable solution.    

Following the stalemate on Ahtisaari?s proposal for a phased process of independence for Kosovo, the Troika was established by the so-called Contact Group of countries -- the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany , Italy and Russia.  The Troika, consisting of European Union, United States and Russian, issued its report in December 2007 after 120 days of unsuccessful talks between the Serbian authorities and the representatives of the Kosovo Albanians.  

Recognition of Kosovo?s independence by other countries will be conditioned upon adherence to the principles outlined in the Ahtisaari plan, which offers Kosovo Serbs exclusive rights, security and privileged relations with Serbia.  Meanwhile the transition from an UNMIK-administered Kosovo to one in which the Government of Kosovo takes full responsibility for managing Kosovo?s affairs, will accelerate as new European structures are established to monitor and ensure adherence to Ahtisaari provisions.  A new consitution and Ahtisaari-compliant laws will be put in place within 120 days after independence is declared.

Parliamentary elections in November and December 2007 resulted in a change in the ruling coalition.  Whereas previously the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) was in a ruling coalition with the Alliance for Kosovo?s Future (AAK), the 2007 elections resulted in a win for the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK).  Subsequently, the PDK joined in a governing coalition with the LDK.

It is in the midst of these historic and significant transitions ? from an UNMIK-administered government to a Kosovar-administered government with European oversight; from a province of Serbia to an independent country with a new constitution and legal framework; and a change in the ruling coalition ? that USAID is currently providing assistance to Kosovo.  USAID has been substatialy involved is supporing rehabilitaion and development in Kosovo since 1999.  In the summer of 2008, it is expected that there will be a donor?s conference, where the USG and the EU together with the multilateral donors will pledge assistance to Kosovo.  The infrastructure program will be linked to pledges made here, and to the Government?s Medium Term Expenditure Fremwwork. 





POSITION DESCRIPTION: 

A. Basic Function of the position: 

The USAID/Kosovo Infrastructure Program Manager will serve as the mission?s leader and cognizant technical officer (CTO) for the infrastructure and rehabilitation programs (excluding energy).  This program will focus on construction, rehabilitation of water and sanitation systems, school buildings, and other possible structures that will provide visible, tangible benefits to the people of newly independent Kosovo.  Activities under this program will dove-tail with the government of Kosovo?s priorities under their Medium Term Expenditure Framework and relate to USG pledges at the donor conference to be held in late spring or summer of 2008.  In addition, these programs will follow guidelines adhering to USAID earmarks in water and other specific areas.  The Infrastructure Program Manager will be responsible for identifying, designing and managing programs that meet USAID/Kosovo objectives of helping the fledgling government of Kosovo be able to provide basic services to its majority ethnic Albanian and minority Serb (and others) population, in a equitable, transparent manner that fosters social harmonization. 

Overall Objective: Based in Pristina, the PSC Infrastructure Program Manager will be assigned to the USAID Economic Growth Office (EGO) and will be responsible for oversight of infrastructure projects in Kosovo (programs relating to the Energy sector will be overseen by a different manager).  He/She will report to the Director of the EGO on technical and policy matters related to infrastructure rehabilitation, and program coordination and implementation.

The Program Manager will supervise one or more Pristina-based Foreign Service National (FSN) local engineers, and will be responsible for oversight of activities and processes related to the planning, design, sub-contracting and execution of water and sanitation, building of schools and other infrastructure projects. This will include: (a) USAID oversight of the U.S. contractor?s activities to insure compliance with contract terms and objectives; (b) monitoring the progress of infrastructure rehabilitation and institutional strengthening activities, including identifying and addressing problems; and (c) certifying for USAID that activities are completed in a timely and effective manner.  

Specific Duties and Responsibilities: The incumbent will have the following specific duties and responsibilities:

* Lead the process of identification and selection of infrastructure rehabilitation projects, through a process involving close liaison with the central government of Kosovo, communities, local governments, utility companies, NGO and donor institutions, the interim administration for the province (UNMIK), the joint allied military force in Kosovo (KFOR), USAID management, and the US Office in Pristina (USOP).  

* Assist in the preparation and review of procurement documentation and review of technical proposals, solicitations, award recommendations, and contracts regarding engineering accuracy and adequacy. 

* Ensure that criteria for rehabilitation project selection are met.  These include: conformity with project eligibility and cost guidelines, engineering feasibility, conformity with local interests, potential for rapid economic and service recovery, potential for operational sustainability and environmental soundness, among others.
 
* Ensure that each project includes an appropriate level of planning for sustainable operations after the completion of physical infrastructure rehabilitation.  This planning will include management and performance objectives of the infrastructure operator/owner, an outline of operational tasks and responsibilities, detailed budget and revenue planning, and performance indicators. Ensure that performance enhancement measures are included in memoranda of agreement between USAID, the beneficiaries, and other relevant parties.  

* Maintain all liaison and direct communications with the U.S. general contractor. Supervise and monitor all planning, design, construction, institutional strengthening, and post-implementation work done by the U.S. general contractor, including work done by sub-contractors.
  
* Report on the Contractor's performance progress and notify the Contractor in writing of deficiencies observed during surveillance, and direct appropriate action to effect correction. Record and report to the Contracting Officer incidents of faulty or nonconforming work, delays or problems.

* Review, on random basis, contract costs submitted by the contractor and sub-contractors.

* Based upon notification by the U.S. general contractor, USAID FSN engineer recommendations, and own inspection, certify that projects are complete and meet all applicable standards. Administratively approve vouchers for reimbursement or advances.

* Supervise and mentor FSN engineer, project development, and clerical staff at USAID/Kosovo and in the field, who will monitor project implementation in the field.  Advise on additional clerical and technical staffing requirements, prepare scopes of work and selection criteria for such staff, and assume supervisory responsibility for the same.
  
* Prepare or oversee the preparation of progress reports and other reports and documents as required by the Mission.  Oversee the development and maintenance of a management and results information system for the program.  Conduct field inspections and site visits.  Accompany visiting USG representatives on field visits, and prepare briefing and informational documentation for official purposes.
   
* Supervise the review, on a quarterly basis, of standard unit costs prepared by the U.S. contractor for materials and construction work and those used to evaluate sub-contract costs.

* Participate in project planning meetings and other technical and policy meetings as required.  Maintain regular and frequent contact with other donors, the interim administration (UNMIK), KFOR, community councils, local governments, NGOs, and private sector representatives regarding infrastructural rehabilitation programs in Kosovo. 
 
* Advise the USAID/Kosovo Mission director, program and technical offices, and other staff regarding issues affecting policy, strategic planning, technical direction, programming, activity design, budgeting, implementation, monitoring, managing for results, and other USAID program management matters.

* Provide the full range of engineering analysis and support services involving the planning and implementation of programs and proposed activities, including preparing portions of key USAID documents such as the Operational Plan, Congressional Budget Justifications, and other strategic reports. 
  
* As member of the Economic Growth Office team perform other advisory, managerial, and reporting tasks.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.001 (a) (2) (ii) to conduct a Market Research before soliciting offers for an acquisition with an estimated value in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold and FAR Part 10.002 (b) (2)(iii) Publishing formal requests for information in appropriate technical or scientific journals or business publications.  The Government?s intent, based on the information received from this RFI is to make a determination to issue Solicitation as a 100% small business set-aside or full and open competition.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential small business sources that are interested in and capable of satisfying the Agency?s requirements described herein.  Please note that this requirement is subject to the availability of funds.  The result of this RFI notice will help determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency?s requirements exist. Additionally, it is not the Government?s intention to enter into a contract based on this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Minerals Management Service (MMS).  The primary purpose of this notice is to improve small business access to acquisition information, to enhance competition and identify potential small businesses (for contracting and subcontracting opportunities) that are interested and capable of performing the work described below.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541720, ?Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities?. Firms responding to this RFI should state whether they are a small business concern, as defined by Small Business Association Size Standard for the NAICS 541720 is $6.5M.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the evaluation of the information received.  MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to the subject of this RFI. BACKGROUND:	The Minerals Management Service (MMS), an agency of the U.S. Department of the Interior, is charged with the responsibility of considering the effects of its actions on significant cultural resources on the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States, from State Waters to the limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone.  This responsibility to ensure proper management and protection of the nation?s cultural heritage is derived from several pieces of legislation including: the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 (as amended), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) of 1978.   Historic shipwrecks have, to date, been discovered through oil industry sonar surveys in water depths of up to 6,500 feet.  Many of these wrecks previously were not known to exist in these areas from the historic record.  Taking these discoveries into account, MMS now includes some deepwater areas, primarily on the approach to the Mississippi River, in our requirement for pre-disturbance archaeological surveys.                                     Recent research  also has shed light on the routes used for shipping during the 16th through the 19th centuries.  This research suggests that there may be a higher potential for earlier shipwrecks (ca.16th-18th century) in Ultra-Deep Water  (UDW) of the Gulf of Mexico (particularly in the Sigsbee Escarpment, Keathley Canyon, DeSoto Canyon, Mississippi Canyon, Green Canyon, and Walker Ridge areas).  MMS studies to date have largely discounted the presence of Exploration or Colonial Period shipwrecks in significant numbers in the GOMR because of the paucity of reported shipwrecks from those periods in the secondary literature, most of which stranded along the coast.  What has not been explored thoroughly are losses far from land associated with other causes (such as fire, structural failure of the hull, foundering during a storm, or armed attack).  Since the likelihood of anyone surviving such a catastrophe at sea also diminishes considerably, the likelihood of its location being accurately reported is almost nil.  Generally, such ships would have been reported as simply ?lost at sea.?    Colonial Period shipwrecks in the UDW almost exclusively would be associated with the Spanish fleets leaving annually from Veracruz in Mexico bound for Havana, Cuba, and eventually for Spain.  Hundreds of ships, laden with goods from Mexico, made the passage to Cuba.  Prevailing winds and currents in the Gulf dictated that fleets sailed north northwest from Vera Cruz to about 26? North Latitude before turning east for Florida.  Losses of ships on this route are poorly understood and are the focus of this research. The MMS has an interest in amassing and assessing this body of research as part of our mission to protect submerged cultural resources from potential effects of oil and gas activity.  Understanding the likelihood of the presence of this type of submerged cultural resource located in the ultra deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico will enable MMS to anticipate and protect these sites.  This knowledge will also enhance the MMS? ability to employ adaptive management strategies in our regulation of OCS oil and gas activities to minimize impacts to significant cultural resources to employ adaptive management of the oil and gas industry to prevent anthropogenic impacts. PURPOSE:  This study shall have a maximum two-year (24 months) period of performance following the date of contract award.  Repositories where archival resources will be evaluated must be identified and visited.  Both a transcription and translation into English of each relevant document will be provided by a professional paleographer in .pdf format.  In addition, digital copies of all relevant documents will be provided to MMS in a .pdf format.  Historical data and imagery acquired under this Contract must be analyzed in such a way as to identify each vessel casualty and establish, in as much as possible, its type and date of construction, nationality, ownership (past and present), use history, mission and cargo (if any) at time of loss, and factors contributing toward its loss.  A goal of the analysis is to determine each vessel?s likely location and potential present condition.  The Contractor shall produce one Report of Findings that presents the assessments of the body of data collected in the archival investigations, including descriptions of methods and analyses, interpretations of the analyzed information, and results and discussions of the findings. STUDY PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS:  Research personnel must possess extensive expertise in maritime history, knowledge of historic research, archival research, translation of archaic Spanish, and paleography.  This expertise must be demonstrated through successful completion of projects comparable to this one or authorship in peer-reviewed publications.  The contractor should also have extensive knowledge of Adobe Acrobat and ESRI ArchGIS.   SOURCES SOUGHT:  Interested organizations should submit a response with approximately 20-page or less that provides information about the small business firm?s ability to perform all aspects of the effort described above.  Emphasis should be placed on prior experience conducting projects of similar scope and complexity, and publications recorded in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  All proprietary information should be marked accordingly.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner. RESPONSES:  Your response must be delivered as: one (1) original plus three (3) hard copies and two (2) electronic/diskette copies (CD MS/Word/PDF), total of four (4) hard copies and two (2) CDs.  Response due date: not later than close of business (COB), 5 P.M.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.   THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE.  The Solicitation Number for this announcement is N62467-07-R-0566.  Southern Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, solicits for:

1.  Response from all large and small business firms interested in proposing on the contract, 

2.  Capability Statements from all qualified and interested parties with a priority on: 8(a) firms, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, and HubZone Small Business firms - first priority, to participate in Public-Private competition using the Standard Competition process, as outlined in the OMB Circular No. A-76, OPNAV Instruction 4860.7D, and FAR Part 15 for Facilities Sustainment performed at the NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic, Hampton Roads, VA.

The Facilities Sustainment (FS) scope of work includes maintenance, repairs and minor construction for buildings, structures, and equipment. The FS services include: performance of maintenance service calls, preventive maintenance (PM) and repair of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, miscellaneous buildings and structures equipment, vertical transportation equipment (VTE), and fire protection systems; interior and exterior maintenance, repair, and minor construction of buildings and structures; overhaul, maintenance and repair of waterfront structures, service craft and equipment with a total of 485 positions. 

The team will evaluate the feasibility and cost effectiveness of converting the existing Government functions to contractor-operated functions.  A contract will not be awarded unless the costs of contracting are lower than the costs of continued Government performance by the minimum cost differential and a determination has been made that no competitive advantage is gained by (a) not making an employer-sponsored health insurance plan available to the workers to be employed under the contract; (b) offering to such workers an employer-sponsored health benefits plan that requires the employer to contribute less towards the premium or subscription share than the amount that is paid by the Department of Defense (DoD) for health  benefits for its civilian employees; or (c) by offering workers a retirement benefit that, in any year, costs less than the annual retirement cost factor applicable to civilian employees of the DoD under chapter 84 of title 5.  Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have the Right of First Refusal.   

The successful service provider will be selected on the basis of Low Priced, Technically Acceptable (LPTA) evaluation criteria under a negotiated, Source Selection process.  The competition will result in either a Letter of Obligation, if awarded to the MEO, or a contract, if awarded to a private firm.  A contract, if awarded, will be firm-fixed price.  The performance term will include a Phase-In Period (3-months), a Base Period (9 Months) and 4 Option Periods (12 Months each), for a total of 5 years in duration.  

The 2002 NAICS Code for the proposed acquisition is 236220, Comercial and Institutional Building Construction , and the small business size standard is $31.0 Million.  The Federal Supply Code is Z119, Maintenance, Repair or Alteration of Real Property Other Administrative and Services Buildings.  

Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 20 percent of the contract work with its own employees.  The Government will use responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT market survey to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  A decision will be made to issue this solicitation as a competitive set-aside for 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned,  HubZone Small Business contractors or to issue an Unrestricted solicitation, inviting full and open competition.  The estimated cost of this acquisition is between $100,000,000 and $250,000,000.  The Government invites contractors with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements to submit Capability Statements consisting of appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references anticipated to be five to ten pages, following the set format.  Respondents must include references and a capability statement for at least two completed projects within the last three years that are similar to the work and within the same dollar value magnitude (adjusted for inflation) of this notice.  Each reference shall include the company name and title, telephone number, and point of contact.  The capability statements for each project should be numbered consistent with the below requirements followed by supporting documentation.  Offerors need to provide a list of projects by contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and evidence of the following specific capabilities: 

1.  Recent and relevant federal government experience within the last 3 calendar years, for projects of similar size, scope, and complexity to the project proposed above.

2.  Provide proof of SBA certification for either 8a or HubZone status. 

The Capabilities Statement for this Sources Sought Market Survey is not expected to be a proposal, but rather short statements regarding the company?s ability to demonstrate existing-or-developed expertise and experience in relation to the areas specified herein.  Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the Capabilities statement.  Submission of Capabilities statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Navy in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities.  This Sources Sought market survey is for information and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  After completing its analysis, the Government will determine whether to limit competition among 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran, HubZone Small Business or to proceed with issuing an Unrestricted solicitation, inviting full and open competition.  Offers that do not meet all requirements or submit within the allotted time will not be considered.  

Electronic submissions will be accepted.  The responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT market survey may be e-mailed to Debby Taylor at debby.taylor@navy.mil or mailed to Southern Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Attn: Debby Taylor, Code COE1DT, P.O. Box 19000, 2155 Eagle Drive, N. Charleston, SC 29419-9010.

<CONTACT>Rochelle Lee  757-322-4182
<DESC>Request for Information NAVFAC eFILES System Pursuant to FAR 15.202(e), the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (herein referred to as ?NAVFAC?) is seeking information associated with the potential procurement of a web based electronic document management system.  NAVFAC also seeks to determine the availability of capable contractors that can provide such a system and hereby invites industry input for alternative methods, improvements or the identification of existing systems adaptable to the Governments needs.   Respondents are encouraged to provide information about alternative electronic document strategies that can help NAVFAC define and finalize its needs.  This is a Request for Information (?RFI?) only.  It is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (?RFP?) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administ!  rative cost incurred in response to this RFI. BACKGROUND NAVFAC procures approximately $4.0 billion of annual construction requirements in support of the U.S. Navy and other federal agencies.  NAVFAC, an Echelon II command, is organized such that all construction field operations are executed through two large subordinate (Echelon III) Commands - NAVFAC Atlantic and NAVFAC Pacific.  These two Commands have ten subordinate (Echelon IV) Facility Engineering Commands (FECs).  These ten FECs collectively have approximately 90 subordinate field offices across the globe.  Each field office does work for one or more major Navy supported commands worldwide.  This might include naval bases, naval air stations, naval submarine bases, naval shipyards, Marine Corps bases, etc.  Each of these field offices is composed of a workforce of Construction Managers, Contract Specialist and Engineering Technicians along with other support personnel who need to share information with one another, personnel at Echelon II & III commands, and various comme!  rcial partners (contractors, designers, consultants etc.).  Each of the 90 offices may do hundreds of contracts each fiscal year and work with dozens of unique contractors.  There could be as many as 14,000 NAVFAC employees using the system at various levels in the organization structure (and for various purposes) worldwide.  This number would not include the number of commercial partners (contractors, designers, consultants) also using the system.   NAVFAC seeks to procure a web based electronic document management system that will allow all of its Echelon II, Echelon III, FECs, Field Offices, and commercial partners (contractors, designers, consultants etc.) to share electronic documents.  The electronic document management system would have a folder tree that would be clearly visible in the left portion of the screen and the files themselves would be clearly visible in the right portion of the screen.  At all levels in the organization, the files to be shared include documents such as Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Adobe Acrobat, pictures in various formats, autocad drawings, video in various formats, etc.  Specifically at the FEC level, the documents to be shared might include GIS drawings, As-Built Technical Drawings, technical documents, standard operating procedures, instructions, announcements of general interest, etc.  These documents would need to be shared within the local FEC and Field Offices.  At the FE!  C level, the documents to be shared might include Organization Charts, workload projections, office staffing information, HRO documents, announcements of general interest etc. These documents would need to be shared within the FEC and with all subordinate activities.  At the field office level, the documents to be shared might specifically include daily contract production reports, quality control reports, request for information, technical submittals, technical drawings (in various formats), specifications, photos, Primavera Suretrak schedules (in native file format and adobe acrobat format) etc.  At the field office level, the folder and subfolder structure for each individual project would generally be similar.  Construction managers, engineering technicians and contract specialists would generally have similar permissions on folders for all projects throughout the office.  However, each project (set of folders) would be assigned to a different construction manager, engi!  neering technician and contract specialist.  Each project would also g enerally be assigned to a unique commercial partner (with various associated personnel).  This commercial partner would need specific permissions on this set of specific folders and subfolders.  The organization and structure of the folders at all levels would be extremely important.  The total number of projects done by NAVFAC each year at all 90 offices is projected to be at least 11,000.    Most of those 11,000 projects are executed with unique contractors.  It would be NAVFAC's desire to have scalable storage space. FUNCTIONALITY DESIRED NAVFAC desires the following functionality in an electronic document management system: ?	The system must have a full audit trail on all folders and documents.   ?	Folders and documents must have check in/check out procedures. ?	All native electronic documents (not scanned Adobe Acrobat files) must be searchable.   ?	The system must have the ability to hyperlink directly to folders.  Each folder at every level must have a unique index/location.  ?	All folders and documents must have the ability to be setup for email notifications.  So that users can be notified when any document is downloaded, uploaded, versioned, edited in any way etc. ?	The system must provide thumbnails of key documents like photos ?	The system must have the batch ability to delete, move, copy, paste, upload or download multiple documents ?	The system must be fully WebDAV compliant and provide full WebDAV capability ?	NAVFAC users must be able to burn a CD/DVD (or any other media) directly from the system. ?	The system must have the capability for folders to ?inherit permissions? of a parent folder.  The system must also have the capability for permissions established on parent folder to ?apply to this folder and all subfolders? ?	The system must provide on-line and PDF training manuals DOD IA/IT REQUIREMENTS NAVFAC Information Assurance (IA) Program is a unified approach to protecting unclassified, sensitive or classified information, and is established to consolidate and focus efforts in securing that information, including its associated systems and resources. IA is required operationally throughout DoN. DoN Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for IT within the Navy, as mandated by the Clinger-Cohen Act, and is the lead for departmental compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA). The application needs to be in compliance with the following instructions to include those referenced within the items below:  Links to the instructions are also shown below. ?

DoD Information  Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP), 30 December 1997 http://iase.disa.mil/ditscap/appjuly00.pdf Additionally, NAVFAC seeks a solution with the following IA aspects: ?	Ability to login using either user ID/password or DoD Common Access Card (CAC) ?	Documents containing personnally identifiable data (PII, per the Privacy Act of 1974), or that are marked with a security classification such as For Official Use Only, need to be flagged or otherwise distinguished from other documents. ?	Documentation on how the product can run in a virtualized environment ?	A security features guide for users and a separate security guide for system administrators Ability to mark groups of documents which, when combined, might result in unintentional disclosure of classified information (and then restrict access to them) CONCERNS NAVFAC is requesting that respondents consider the following critical aspects of the system when addressing this request for information. System Design - The document management system being proposed could become so large with so many users, and so many folders & documents that careful consideration would need to be given to critical design features of the system.  This might include how domains (or root level folders) could possibly be used, how folder organization and structure would be designed etc.  The speed of system is a significant concern.  Response time for navigation between folders must be minimized.  Upload and download speed must be maximized.  Ease of finding folders & documents must be paramount. Project Creation- NAVFAC would anticipate that as many as 50 projects could be added per working day across NAVFAC.  In turn, each of these projects could have dozens of folders and subfolders.  The result would be that hundreds of folders and subfolders could potentially be added each working day across NAVFAC.  It would be extremely cumbersome to permission these folders and subfolders individually.  So a clever mechanism must be developed to make new project setup as easy as possible.  This might possibly include some scenario of copying a set of template folders that already have pre-permissioned groups.  Then assigning users (once) to these pre-permissioned groups which would immediately give these users the proper permissions on a large number of folders and subfolders.  Respondents are encouraged to submit alternative ideas that might also serve the same purpose. Employee Turnover - There are construction managers, engineering technicians and contract specialists that leave NAVFAC frequently and need to be replaced with other employees.  So a mechanism must be developed which allows one user (with associated permissions on a large number of folders) to be easily replaced by another new user who would be given the exact same permissions on the exact same folders. System Administration - System administration must be carefully designed.  A small group of users must be able to do system wide functions like setup new users, reset passwords, disable accounts, delete folders or documents loaded by mistake etc.  Part of this functionality would require an easy way to find and administer user accounts.  A significantly larger group of users (possibly all construction managers at all Field Offices) must be able to establish, control and permission groups against folders etc.  Since there would potentially be thousands of users and thousands of groups, there must be a quick and easy way to locate/add the groups and an easy way to locate/add the users.  Within the folder structure, there must be an easy method (involving one screen and only a few mouse clicks) of adding, controlling and permissioning an unlimited combination of users and groups against folders. End of Contract turnover:  NAVFAC anticipates a maximum five year service contract for this system.  At the end of that term, all documents and information stored on the system must be transferred to a follow-on contract, or to the Government, as determined at that time.  STRATEGY NAVFAC is requesting information on two general methods of procurement which are under consideration; 1)	Procure a fully hosted subscription service ("software as a service") that provides a fully integrated technology for storing electronic documents which also includes managing, processing, and delivering these same files; and  2)	Procure an enterprise application (fully hosted by NAVFAC) which provides the same fully integrated technology for storing electronic documents which also includes managing, processing and delivering these same files. This RFI is intended to solicit information and suggestions with regard to both strategies.  Part 1 of the RFI pertains to respondents who would propose a fully hosted subscription service.  Part 2 of the RFI pertains to respondents who would propose that NAVFAC procure an enterprise application that is fully hosted at a NAVFAC site. PART 1 - FULLY HOSTED SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE For those respondents that propose NAVFAC procure a fully hosted subscription service (?software as a service?), we are requesting that the following information be provided: 1.	What advantages would you suggest NAVFAC take under advisement when considering a fully hosted subscription service? 2.	Please provide your input on an overall system design (and possible RFP requirements that NAVFAC should consider) which would meet the general intent described in the ?Background? section described above. 3.	Please provide your input on the commercial availability of all functionality listed under ?Functionality Desired? section above.  Which of these items are difficult to achieve? 4.	Please provide your input on the difficulty of meeting the requirements outlined in the DOD IT Requirements section above 5.	Please describe the strategy that you suggest NAVFAC should adopt (and RFP requirements NAVFAC should consider) for meeting the requirements of the ?System Design? under the Concerns section above. 6.	Please describe the strategy that you suggest NAVFAC should adopt (and RFP requirements NAVFAC should consider) for meeting the requirements of the ?Project Creation? under the Concerns section above. 7.	Please describe the strategy that you suggest NAVFAC should adopt (and RFP requirements NAVFAC should consider) for meeting the requirements of the ?Employee Turnover? under the Concerns section above. 8.	Please describe the strategy that you suggest NAVFAC should adopt (and RFP requirements NAVFAC should consider) for meeting the requirements of the ?System Administration? under the Concerns section above. 9.	Please provide your input on RFP requirements that NAVFAC should consider for follow on yearly technical support that would be associated with an effort similar to that described in this RFI.  This would include troubleshooting technical issues associated with the web based electronic document management system as well as providing any help desk support such as on-line, email and voice (telephone) etc.  10.	Please provide your input on what an "industry standard" requirement would be for security of electronic document data. 11.	If the respondent has any knowledge concerning the Navy Marine Corps Internet (NMCI) network, please provide your input on the use of Java and ActiveX as it relates to this effort.  We believe ActiveX and Java Script may be blocked at the Boundary of the NMCI network.  This may present issues since key features of certain systems (like drag & drop) may or may not be possible with the NMCI network. 12.	What would be a rough yearly cost estimate (over a 5 year period) for procurement of a fully hosted subscription service that has been generally described in this RFI? 13.	Provide your suggestion on what strategy NAVFAC should adopt for the recovery of all its electronic documents in the event that a successful relationship cannot continue past a pre-determined period of time (5 years for example)  PART 2 - ENTERPRISE APPLICATION HOSTED BY NAVFAC For those respondents that propose NAVFAC host an enterprise application, we are requesting that the following information be provided: 1.	What advantages would you suggest NAVFAC take under advisement when considering an enterprise application which is fully hosted by NAVFAC? 2.	Please provide your input on an overall system design (and possible RFP requirements that NAVFAC should consider) which would meet the general intent described in the ?Background? section described above. 3.	Please provide your input on the commercial availability of all functionality listed under ?Functionality Desired? section above.  Which of these items are difficult to achieve? 4.	Please provide your input on the difficulty of meeting the requirements outlined in the DOD IT Requirements section above 5.

What would be a rough yearly cost estimate (over a 5 year period) for procurement of an enterprise application that has been generally described in this RFI?  This would include the initial software procurement & configuration along with any ancillary yearly support costs that might be considered necessary.

Due to the systemic changes required by the New Vision, work items outlined here will incorporate all facets of JC operations. The contractor is expected to collaborate with staff, Regional Office staff & other support contractors in carrying out the work.  
I. Credentials 
In 2007, the NOJC developed & released national guidelines for its 40+ CTT programs which were aligned to the training requirements, current industry standards, or industry requirements necessary for specific program, instructor & student certification attainment. NOJC is seeking assistance: (1) to further implement & provide technical assistance for this initial effort, (2) continue development of industry-certified training programs, & (3) expand CTT offerings to new areas.

II. Standards-Based Training 
 JC New Vision calls for the development of a standards-based training system consisting of industry/technical standards, applied academic standards, basic academic standards, & career success standards. JC is moving forward from a narrow, discrete task-driven approach to training & its curricula to a broader, standards-based approach whereby training & its curricula will be driven by standards that specify what students need to understand (concepts), know (skills & procedures) & be able to do (activities & tasks). Identified steps for developing the standards-based training system include: (1) the determination of academic underpinnings for various CTT areas as outlined by JC program guidelines, which are referred to as Training Achievement Records (TARs), (2) the development of applied academic statements based on the skills & competencies specified in the TARs, (3) the determination of basic skill standards required to master applied academic standards, & (4) the development of a common framework to express TAR competencies, applied academic statements & basic skill statements in a common language. 
JC launched the eLearning Initiative to create a fully integrated technology-based system for JC programming. Central to this initiative is a technology infrastructure that will: house student training standards; generate individualized learning plans & track student progress; gather information about student skills & knowledge through a student testing system that will deliver assessments; & deliver student courses.

<DESC>Provide all labor and specialized equipment needed to recover spent aircraft de-icing fluid (ADF) on the Westover ARB East and North ramps in order to prevent glycol material from entering base storm water drainage systems.

Please provide a per-occurance price, an occurance being the recovery of fluid from one aircraft de-icing prior to aircraft launch. Personnel must be on-call and able to respond within approximately 2 hours of request. Multiple occurances may take place during the same call. Services will be required during the winter months when aircraft icing events occur. Each occurance will require the recovery of up to 3,000 gallons of ADF.

ADF must be prevented from entering the ramp storm drains and recovered from the ramp surfaces within 4 hours after running off the aircraft. Necessary equipment, such as storm drain covers, vacuums, etc., must be removed and stored in a designated area until the next event. The recovered ADF must be removed and recycled. A 15,000 gallon underground tank at Building 7711 can be utilized for interim storage of spent material, but that tank is NOT available for long-term storage of recovered ADF.

On-call personnel will need to coordinate with Westover Base Security, Operations, and Maintenance to meet base and ramp access requirements to perform all work in accordance with all Westover ARB safety and security regulations.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for rotary wing transport service for Iraq.  There is no solicitation package available at this time.

USTRANSCOM/TCAQ-R is seeking sources that may be able to provide aircraft capable of flying between 150 - 200 hours monthly.  The Government anticipates the size of the aircraft needed to support movement of a minimum of 18 passengers and cargo.  The Government anticipates the contractor positioning three to four rotary wing aircraft at Udairi Army Airfield, Camp Buehring, Kuwait to transport passengers and cargo.  Although missions may involve destinations throughout Southern Iraq and Kuwait, the primary focus areas will be Camp Buehring (Udairi AAF), Camp Bucca, Basra Contingency Operating Base (COB), Umm Qasr (North and South Port), Camp Arifjan (Patton AAF) and their surrounding areas.  Other destinations can be added on a mission-by-mission basis.  Contractor must be DoD Approved and be able to transport both passengers and cargo. Cargo will primarily consist of passenger equipment (bags, protective equipment, etc). Other cargo may be loaded if there is space available. The cargo will be configured for loading inside the cabin of the aircraft.  The contractor will be notified by the US Government prior to loading of any cargo of a hazardous, flammable, or explosive nature and any such cargo must be properly documented and certified per applicable military transport standards.  
   The cargo will be configured for loading inside the cabin of the aircraft.  No special licenses or certifications are required to transport any cargo provided by the government.  

All interested parties should respond with rotary wing type and capacity that is currently available that would justify the source's qualifications to perform this task.  In addition, please provide an estimate of cost for a monthly service fee and flight hours.  

At this time, USTRANSCOM is NOT looking for proposals. NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals, nor a Request for Quotations, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

Responses to this RFI are due 28 February 2008, 1600hrs (CST).  Electronic copies can be submitted to Cynthia.Woods@ustranscom.mil.  If you submit proprietary data, please mark it clearly with the appropriate markings.  Further action on this anticipated requirement will be determined following review of the responses to this RFI.  

All correspondence regarding this RFI should be addressed to Cynthia Woods, Contract Specialist, USTRANSCOM/TCAQ-R, email Cynthia.Woods@ustranscom.mil or Pamela Hall, Contracting Officer, USTRANSCOM/TCAQ-R, email Pamela.Hall@ustranscom.mil

<CONTACT>Jose Benitez, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-344-3097, Fax 202-344-2720, Email jose.e.benitez@cbp.dhs.gov
<DESC>1.0    BACKGROUND.

This is a ?Sources Sought? Announcement.  The Secure Borders Initiative (SBI) Acquisition Group of the Department of Homeland Security?s (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP) organization is seeking information from contractors that have experience with HIGH RESOLUTION SURVEILLANCE SENSORS/SYSTEMS as applied to a northern border riverine environment. The intended area of operation is the Great Lakes Region and associated navigable waterways.

CBP is the executive agent in DHS for the development of SBInet.  SBInet?s mission is to plan for, acquire, and field the appropriate combinations of technology and infrastructure to support CBP?s efforts to secure effective control of the border. The SBInet Program is part of the SBI, a comprehensive multi-year, nationwide program sponsored by DHS to secure America?s borders and reduce illegal immigration.  The program has a direct impact on CBP?s primary mission to prevent terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United States while facilitating the movement of legitimate trade and people.  The SBInet System Program Office (SPO) provides the resources and capabilities necessary to bring effective control to the Nation?s borders and provides frontline agents and officers with the resources required to achieve border security.  

SBInet will prototype and demonstrate an integrated air, land and maritime border security solution in the lower St. Clair River (Algonac, MI) area of operation in the 2008-2009 time frame.  The prototype will consist of a mix of ground and air based sensors integrated into a Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C3I) system to provide increased scene awareness in the area of interest. The objective is to detect and track illegal border intrusions which include but not limited to small boats, jet skis, humans walking across ice, swimmers and low flying planes.

The focus of this announcement is the riverine environment. This environment poses unique border security challenges in that the relatively narrow water ways allows for a short time to detect items of interest/vessels, usually operating at high speeds, and once detected allow for little time to develop an useful tracking vector. The needed sensors/sensor systems must be able to rapidly detect items of interest and accurately identify them as persons, marine vessels or winter vehicles.  Classification of threat or intent of item of interest is a desired capability.

2.0       MINIMUM OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Northern Border Demonstration Project requires proven mission products to improve surveillance, detection, tracking, and identification capabilities that can be deployed across northern border riverine environments.  Operational temperatures range from -26?C to 51 ?C (-15?F to 124?F) and survival temperatures range from -40 ?C to 55 ?C (-40 ?F to 132 ?F).  Sensors will operate in surface winds up to 56 km/hr (35 mph) velocity and will survive wind speed up to 145 km/hr (90 mph).

The area of interest will be a mix of urban, industrial and suburban communities. The sensor/system must communicate to a command center beyond line of sight in a secure mode. Four general performance goals for the required solution are as follows: (1.) Provide continuous coverage of the riverine border area of operation with a 95% Availability for Operation (Ao). (2.) Detect 90% of the items of interest crossing the border in either direction with a false alarm rate less than 5%.  (3.) Correctly identify 90% of the item of interest as a person or a marine vessel to include ships, pleasure boats, sailboats, skiffs and kayaks with a rate of false positives less than 5%. (4.) Sensor will communicate the items of interest position to the C3I geospatial display with an accuracy within 10 meters; communication may be non-line of sight.

The systems should be commercially available, operationally viable (demonstrable at the Technology Readiness Level (TRL 8/9).  The systems should also incorporate open architecture and "commercial-off-the-shelf" (COTS), non-developmental item equipment. System performance, size, weight, availability, user interface, safety and life cycle support will be important evaluation factors.   Interested vendors must be capable of demonstrating their sensor systems as an integrated end product and provide operational data to prove the TRL level of their product.  

TRL 8 means that the actual system was completed and 'flight qualified' through test and demonstration.  The technology has been proven to work in its final form and under expected conditions. In almost all cases, this TRL represents the end of true system development. 

TRL 9 means that the actual system was 'flight proven' through successful mission operations.  The actual application of the technology in its final form and under mission conditions, such as those encountered in operational test and evaluation. In almost all cases, this is the end of the last "bug fixing" aspects of true system development.

<DESC>The Bureau of Human Resources, the United States Department of State, is seeking information from industry that will assist in our consideration of a possible procurement of services where under the contractor would provide specialized technical, analytical, and mathematical modeling services of a contractor with federal workforce planning experience.  Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

Introduction

Commencing in March 2000 the Bureau of Human Resources, Resource Management and Analysis Division, began the process of gathering and integrating data of the Department?s total work force composition used for its current and out year force planning.  Over the past six years, the Department of State (DOS) has enhanced its ability to do workforce planning by developing analytical methodologies, processes, and simulation models that allow resource management analysts to mathematically:
?	Compute overseas staffing and readiness requirements for Foreign Service officers utilizing an Overseas Staffing Model (OSM).
?	Calculate domestic staffing requirements for Foreign Service, civil service, contractor, and part-time, intermittent & temporary employees utilizing a Domestic Staffing Model (DSM).
?	Analyze Foreign Service promotion opportunities by simulating career flows, attrition, and ensuing personnel inventories that result from Foreign Service HR policies utilizing a Foreign Service Promotion Model.
Some of these methodologies were developed ?in-house?, while others have been developed through contract support to the Bureau of Human Resources, Resource Management and Analysis Division (HR/RMA).  HR/RMA has a need for continued, follow-on, support to maintain these workforce planning models and methodologies to meet the requirements of Congressional mandates and to continue to improve the Department's capabilities to do workforce planning.

Scope of Work

HR/RMA requires specialized technical, analytical, and mathematical modeling services of a contractor with federal workforce planning experience. The contractor shall work with RMA analysts to identify opportunities for increasing organizational efficiencies and streamlining staff functions and processes, by analyzing workload distribution and staffing data, such as name, grade levels, salary, duty assignment, etc., collected during the FY 2001-2006 Domestic Staffing Model (DSM) and the Fy-2006 Overseas Staffing Model (OSM). 
	
Additionally, HR/RMA requires specialized technical, analytical, and mathematical modeling services of a contractor to participate in the annual update and maintenance process for the Overseas Staffing Model (OSM) and Domestic Staffing Model (DSM).

<DESC>The Portland VA Medical Center is looking for a company that can manage the parking pass database, issue parking cards, and manage overflow parking needs with potential off-site valet solutions. The current parking pass database needs to be revalidated and a new database needs to be created.  The new system needs to link into our existing gate card electronics system. The Portland VAMC has 2200 employees and 400 contract or on-station fee staff working at the medical center.  Although some of these staff are off-tour night and weekend employees, the majority work at least some-time Monday through Friday during business hours.  The medical center has 988 parking spaces reserved for employees scattered among 14 parking lots.  Access to parking is managed through a database system connected to our proxy card electronics system.  The medical center has a set of guidelines for who is entitled to parking cards based upon job type, carpool status, use of public transportation benefits, tour of duty requirements, and service level flex passes (given out to staff on an intermittent basis, not dedicated).  Currently the database has 2650 active approved cards, but some system discrepancies exist.   This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<SUBJECT>B -- Sole Source Acquisition to Set Up a Community-Based Effort to Acquire Clinical Specimens from Patients with STARI Diagnosis
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indends to issue a sole source purchase order to the University of North Carolina, Department of Family Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, to procure services to set up a community-based effort to acquire clinical specimens from consenting patients who have a diagnosis of Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness (STARI). Patients have been observed to develop a rash illness that resembles early Lyme disease after lone star (Amblyomma americanum) tick bites. The cause of this illness is unknown, although it is not due to borrelia burgdorferi, the bacteria that cause Lyme disease.  This illness was first recognized in patients exposed to lone star ticks in southern states and these ticks are found predominately, but not exclusively, in the south.  The condition is currently called STARI (southern tick-associated rash illness) to reflect these associations.  Previous work by ourselves and others has evaluated the hypothesis that an organism of the genus borrelia is the etiologic agent, based on our detection of Borrelia lonestari in the skin of a rash patient and in the attached lone star tick.  However, further investigations failed to link borrelia to STARI patients in most cases.  To continue to search for the cause of this illness, CDC needs skin biopsy and blood samples from STARI patients and ticks that attached to the rash site (when available).  For purposes of this procurement, a STARI patient is defined as:  A person with acute onset (within 14 days of visit to a health care provider's office) of an annular, erythematous, expanding rash that attains a size of at least 5 cm in diameter, when no alternative explanation for the rash can be found, and a history of tick bite or potential exposure to ticks within 14 days before the onset of the rash.  Systematic analysis of clinical samples and ticks may provide new insight regarding the the cause of STARI. The purpose of this procurement is to obtain clinical information and specimens from patients meeting the CDC case definition of STARI.  The clinical samples will subsequently be evaluated by CDC investigators in order to develop a hypothesis about the cause of this illness.  Portions of the samples will be analysed by Universal Biosensor, a technology offered by a private company.  In addition, clinical materials will be evaluated by methods such as polymerase chain reaction, serology, passage of appropriate samples into mice, and testing of mouse tissues. CDC may benefit from this procurement by acquiring data that may point to the cause of STARI.  Once a cause is known, laboratory tests may then be devised by CDC staff to evaluate specimens from patients who are suspected to have this illness. The scope of work for this procurement is as follows: Vendor must establish a mechanism and project team to enroll patients who meet a case definition of STARI in an area previously shown to be suitable for identifying such patients.  This work will include developing documents to obtain informed consent from patients and assuring that the federal and institutional standards for protection of human subjects are met.   Vendor must work with collaborating physicians to enroll properly informed, eligible, and consenting volunteers and obtain clinical samples as specified in a CDC Institutional Review Board-approved study protocol. Vendor must handle clinical materials so that their biologic integrity is preserved and transfer them, together with relevant clinical information, to investigators at the CDC. The vendor shall set up the means to acquire appropriate clinical specimens from volunteers in the community during the peak period of STARI occurrence (March through at least July, 2008).  This effort must be made in conformance with all applicable regulations to project human subjects.  The required outcome is an effort that can reasonably be expected to produce skin biopsy samples and blood specimens from 12 different patients, although 20 would be desirable. Components of the technical means to meet the required outcome include designating a study coordinator, contacting and training potential collaborating medical care providers, advertising the study in the relevant communities to encourage patient participation, reimbursing providers for phlebotomy and skin biopsy charges in accordance with the CDC compensation scale (when necessary), and facilitating acquisition of clinical samples.  The vendor shall transfer or facilitate the transfer of the deliverables to CDC, Fort Collins, Colorado. The government will furnish the study protocol and documents specified above, as well as study kits and prepaid airbills. The vendor shall provide the following deliverables to the project officer by the times specified: (1) A copy of the informed consent documents approved by vendor's Institutional Review Board within 2 months of purchase order award; (2) Proof of hiring a study coordinator within 2 months of purchase order award; (3) Names of all, but minimum four, collaborating medical clinics in a STARI-endemic area, within 2 months of purchase order award; and (4) skin biopsy specimens, blood, and serum samples, as specified in the CDC study protocol, from at least 12 patients no later than September 30, 2008. This procurement involves setting up a community-based effort to acquire clinical specimens; minimum vendor qualifications consist of: (1) Previous experience in the design and implementation of a community-based medical study, preferably evidenced by peer-reviewed publications; (2)  Knowledge of human subjects protection requirements, preferably evidenced by IRB-approval of a previous protocol or informed consent document.  Institution must have a FWA number; (3)  Ability to demonstrate access to patients who meet the CDC case definition of Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness (STARI); (4).  A medical degree should be held by the principal investigator (M.D., D.O., or equivalent), and (5)  Ability to start project immediately for the 2008 peak STARI transmission season (approximately March through July). Vendor must be able to facilitate sample acquisition and same-day transfer to CDC by overnight courier service. Vendor must have office support to pay charges for phlebotomy and skin biopsy specimen acquisition when requested by collaborating clinics. The state epidemiologist of North Carolina identified the above mentioned vendor as having access to the appropriate STARI study population, besides fulfilling all other requirements for this procurement.CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

<SUBJECT>B -- Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Purchase Order
<DESC>Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 6, Subparts 6.302-1, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) intends to contract with Marine Computation Services, Inc. (MCS) on a sole source basis. This acquisition is being conducted using Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. 

USDOT PHMSA is the Federal agency charged with the safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operation of the nation?s pipeline offshore and onshore transportation system.  The current version of API RP 2RD, the standard for dynamic risers for floating facilities, was last updated in 1998 and contains little information on application of best practices.  There are volunteers from industry currently working to revise the standard but, due to heavy workloads, the deadline set by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the International Standards Organization (ISO) may not be met.  In the fall of 2007, MCS presented a proposal for launching a Joint Industry Project (JIP) to expedite the update of the ISO/API standard by providing project administration, drafting, technical, and project management support to the existing joint ISO/API Task Group.  The JIP is to be funded by various organizations that each contribute a $40,000 sponsorship/membership fee.  An objective of PHMSA's safety program is to ensure that industry has access to the best design, construction and maintenance practices.  The objective of the fee for service purchase is to participate in and support the JIP in their efforts to expedite the update of ISO 13628-12/API RP 2RD standard for Dynamic Risers for Floating Production Installations.

API RP 2RD is the most widely accepted steel riser code in the deepwater offshore industry.  The JIP has widespread industry and Federal Government support to ensure the revised version of the standard will be expedited quickly for submittal to ISO and API for approval.  MCS, along with one partner/subcontractor have collaborated to develop and lead the JIP.  MCS has a successful track record in the delivery of multiple industry JIPs over the past ten years, many of which have been focused on the development of industry codes of practice for riser and related subsea technologies.  

Any response to this notice must demonstrate that competition would be advantageous to the government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities, pricing, and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet PHMSA's needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted via e-mail not later than 5:00 PM EST on March 6, to Mr. Eric Hilton, eric.hilton@dot.gov, Contract Specialist, PHMSA Office of Contracts and Procurement.  

This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the government. If no affirmative written response is received within 15 days from the publication of this synopsis, a purchase order may be issued to Marine Computation Services, Inc.

Background: 
      
WMATA has over 211 miles of track system comprising of at-grade subway, elevated surface tracks, 83 stations and 8 storage yards.  The subway and above ground services are almost evenly split.  The rail cars operate on five lines (Red, Green, Blue, Orange and Yellow) that run through Washington D.C., Maryland and Virginia.

 The track varies in age from 30 years old to the recently constructed Green Line and Blue Line extensions.  The rail used is AREMA 115 pound rail, cant is 1:40, and nominal tangent track gage is 56 ".  The cars operate on 750 VDC electrified third rail. The vehicles can be controlled in two modes, manual and automatic.  Speeds can be maintained from 3 MPH up to 75 MPH.  The cars are 75 feet long, ten feet wide and operate as married pairs in consists of up to eight cars.

WMATA wants to ensure its rail system is operating at peak efficiency, producing the safest possible conditions as related to track defects, track geometry and third rail geometry.  These parameters will include but are not limited to gage, super elevation, curvature, surface profile, lateral alignment, defects, distance of third rail from gage face of nearest running rail, third rail height above running rail measured under full load

<SUBJECT>N -- Saflok System Installation
<DESC>It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract under statutory authority of the test program for commercial items Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.501(a)1(ii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This agency intends to award to Winfield Locks, Inc. 1721 Whittier Ave., Costa Mesa, CA 48083-2205.

1.  The 6th Services Squadron requires installation of new Saflok 6000 system software and (187) Saflok door locks as well as a system interface add-on package for multiple key encoders for MacDill AFB lodging.  Once completely installed, The 6th Services Squadron also requires applicable staff training on the Saflok system.

2.   The award of a contract for Saflok 6000 system software and door lock installation and the system interface add-on package must be awarded to Winfield Locks, Inc. because they are the only company trained to work with the Saflok equipment and software.  Due to proprietary rights and configuration knowledge it would prevent other companies from installing the equipment and performing system upgrades unless system replacement takes place.  Current replacement of the system is not cost effective for the government.  Additionally, Winfield Locks, Inc. would be the most qualified company to provide training on the system.

3.  Market research was conducted for Saflok 6000 system software and door lock installation and Winfield Locks, Inc. is the only contractor found able to perform this service as we require. If no response to this notice is received by 3:00pm EST on Friday, February 27, 2008, the award for Saflok System 6000 and door lock installation will be made to Winfield Locks, Inc. The POC for this notice is SSgt Joseph P. Borello, Contract Specialist, Phone: (813) 828-7483; Fax (813) 828-3667, Email: joseph.borello@macdill.af.mil.

Once this discussion concludes there will be a discussion on how GSA can best secure transportation services for other Federal agencies with significant transportation needs.  3PLs are not being considered to service these customers.  For the Global Supply program, the main driver is to obtain lower costs while maintaining quality service levels, and for other customer agencies, the main goals are to streamline the ordering process while ensuring on-time delivery and quality service levels.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY TO DETERMINE AVAILABILITY OF INTERESTED CONTRACTORS.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Health Revenue Center maintains a state of the art call center operation handling in excess of four million calls per year, with operating hours Monday through Friday 6 AM to 7 PM Central time. Additional business services provided to various components within the Department of Veterans Affairs include activating emergency call center support services (recent examples include support for VA Facilities affected by Hurricane Katrina and the San Diego wildfires). Due to unknown variables and the unpredictable nature of emergency activation, our internal capacity may be insufficient to accommodate the call volume.

The HRC requests all interested parties submit information that addresses the items listed in the Requirements and Instructions sections of this document.

The vendor must have demonstrated ability to: a) quickly establish Call Center services; b) maintain those services for an extended period of time; c) staff the Call Center with trained professionals who are able to deal with the complex needs of distraught callers; d) provide a dedicated number in advance of a disaster, to which a toll-free, publicized number could be directed.     An hourly call capacity of over 1,000 is required, and the ability to augment these phone services with a website; e) provide a system to input, remotely access, and maintain data received via phone calls; and f) provide translation capabilities and the ability to receive international calls.     (2) Past Performance: The contractor is requested to provide past performance references relevant to requirements a) through f) above along with complete and current contact information (customer name, project name/contract number, address, contact name, phone number and email).

The contractor shall provide all labor, personnel, materials, parts, transportation, and any other items necessary to fabricate parts, remove and install a static display aircraft A-10 from Pope AFB to Seymour Johnson AFB, NC.  This process will be conducted in two phases.  During the first phase, the contractor will disassemble, package, transport and reassemble an A-10 aircraft from Pope AFB, NC to Seymour Johnson AFB, NC.  The contractor will transport the aircraft to a designated hangar and reassemble the aircraft in a towable condition.  The contractor shall also fabricate and install the upper portion of the support column (TS 16?x16?) with a base plate and top mount similar to that shown on Sheet S-1 and also used for the F15E, F100, and F86 static displays currently on display at Seymour Johnson AFB.  The contractor shall be responsible for designing the column-to-aircraft connection details on top of the upper column. This upper column shall be fabricated to be compatible with the lower section of the column as far as bolt alignments, etc (also shown on Sheet S-1). The proposed pitch for the A-10 is 15 degrees nose high and the proposed bank is zero degrees (wings level). The aircraft will then be turned over to members of the 4 MXG for the restoration process.  The aircraft is currently designated to be added to the aircraft park display located within Heritage Park.  The aircraft is planned, tentatively, to be placed between the F-100 and F-86 aircraft.  The 4 FW will have the ground portion of the stand (pylon), completed prior to the return of the contractor.  
During the second phase the contractor will return to Seymour Johnson AFB to mount the A-10 (with integral upper column) on an existing lower support column (TS 24?x24?) with the top plate and bolt pattern as shown on Sheet S-1.  The contractor will remove the outer wing panels to permit towing of the aircraft from the flight line to the display site and will reassemble the wings at the display site.  During installation of the aircraft mounting plate, the contractor will keep visual modifications to the aircraft to a minimum and replace any removed skin panels with like aircraft grade metal and fasteners.  The contractor will lift the aircraft onto the designated stand (pylon) and securely attach the two pylons at the mounting plates.

The contractor will crane lift the aircraft onto a flat-bed trailer provided by SJAFB.  Contractor will configure the trailer with a support cradle made from dunnage or another suitable material.  The cradle must be high enough to provide between 2? - 3 feet of space between the aircraft bottom fuselage and the trailer deck to allow access to the aircraft bottom for the restoration. Contractor will secure the aircraft to the trailer to facilitate low speed towing by SJAFB personnel to a maintenance hanger.  Light wear to the lawn around the worksite is understandable but, Contractor will repair any ruts caused by Contractor vehicles or equipment.  During replacement or modification of the aircraft mounting plate, Contractor will keep visual modifications to the aircraft to a minimum and replace any removed skin panels with like aircraft grade fasteners.  Contractor will be available to re-install aircraft on its original pedestal after SJAFB personnel refurbish the aircraft.

The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a brand name only commercial purchase order in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13.  This notice documents and incorporates provisions and clauses which are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-14, 22 Nov 06.  The North America Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334510 and the size standard is 500 employees.

The government intends to award a name brand commercial purchase order to Aspect Medical System, Inc.  The requirement is to purchase:  
BIS VISTA MONITORING SYSTEMS, 4 EACH.

The justification for the brand name requirement is as follows:
The Anesthesia providers at the USAF Hospital, know of no other system available on the market that measures brainwaves.  Other monitoring systems available (GE S/5 Anesthesia Monitor, Nihon Kohden AG920RA Anesthesia Gas Monitor, and Spacelabs Anesthesia Monitoring System) only measure a patient?s vital signs.  

The BIS VISTA SYSTEM is a replacement for the current BIS A-2000 system that the Surgical Suite has, and that is past it?s life expectantcy.  The four requested monitors will be placed in all four operating rooms, attached to the anesthesia machine.  

The BIS VISTA MONITORING SYSTEM is solely developed, marketed, and manufactured by ASPECT MONITORING SYSTEMS, INC.  In addition, a search of the internet for the BIS VISTA MONITOR identified ASPECT MONITORING SYSTEMS, INC., as the only provider for this product.  All of the anesthesia providers assigned to the USAF Academy Hospital have been trained on and are proficient with the BIS MONITORING SYSTEM, which is also used at other medical facilities.    

All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.  

Any company that feels they can provide an equal product that meets all the government?s requirements as stated above must submit their technical data (2 pages or less) to support their claim no later than 26 February 2008 at 0800 hour Mountain Time.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.

Point of Contact is Carol Thompson, Contract Specialist (719) 333-3600; email: (carol.thompson@usafa.af.mil) or  alternate Leslie Ryan, Contracting Officer (719) 333-3961; email: leslie.ryan@usafa.af.mil

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 under Simplified Acquisition procedures in Subpart 13.5 as supplemental with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is RFP101188 and is being issued as a Request for Proposal.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-18.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561990. The purpose of this Contract is to engage the services of a contractor to support the Clinical Center Patient representative. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC) is a clinical research hospital providing all medical services for patients participating in human research protocols of the NIH. The CC provides patient facilities and services for clinical investigations by the NIH Institutes, research in related areas and supervises residency and other training programs. 

?Professional Services Contract Statement of Work?

The contractor will serve as assistant to the Clinical Center Patient Representative (PR). He/ she will be responsible for contacting patients and family members as assigned, who are seeking assistance from the PR office. He/ she will work closely with the PR to insure a seamless response to expressed concerns and a coordinated approach to hospital staff, administrators, Institute staff and others needed to resolve the problems. He/ she will investigate patient/ family complaints and develop a plan of action in concert with the PR. Effective communication with staff at all levels of the organization ? administrators, clinical research staff, and Institute staff ? as well as clinicians and many others outside the hospital will make successful resolution possible.

The contractor, working with the PR, will be involved in the continued development of systematic data management that maintains the confidentiality of patients, while meeting the needs of the organization in a more comprehensive, consistent, and apparent manner.  

The contractor will help the PR to develop a systematic pro-active approach to patients and families in the outpatient clinics. Currently, inpatients are contacted routinely and made aware of the PR program, and there are numerous professional staff available to them on the patient-care unit. The outpatients are not given this same support. Their contact with staff is considerably less and often they are faced with complex problems to handle on their own. 

The contractor will contact patients and families, assigned by the PR, in follow-up to determine the outcome of intervention by the PR office. He/ she will be responsible for helping the PR to develop a system for responding to whatever needs remain unmet and maintaining contact with the individual(s) until a more complete resolution of the problem or concern occurs. 

With the increase in requests to the PR office for consent-monitoring, the contractor will work with clinical research teams as assigned, and provide consent-monitoring when appropriate from a patient-advocacy point of view. Together, the PR and the contractor will determine the most appropriate situations for providing this service. Communication about these cases with both the Clinical Bioethics Department and the NIMH Psychiatric Consult Service will continue in an ongoing way to provide the optimal service to patients and families.

The contractor will help the PR to evaluate the PR volunteer program and to assess its changing needs and focus. He/ she will help to re-direct and re-train current volunteers as appropriate and necessary.

Working closely with the PR, the contractor will review very complex cases, will help to determine the best approach to handle them and will participate in evaluation of the outcome. 

Using professional skills and experience, the contractor will work with the PR to identify areas within the NIH clinical research program for enhancing patient advocacy. Both will work together to describe this model of patient advocacy within a clinical research setting with presentations in appropriate settings and in written materials to be submitted for publication in professional journals.

1.	Demonstrated experience serving as a patient representative at a clinical research institution
2.	Demonstrated experience in dealing with research subjects and issues arising from signing informed consent and participating in clinical research trials

1.	Be on-site and available by pager or phone when the patient representative is on scheduled annual leave.
2.	Provide staff augmentation and data collection and analysis services on a regularly scheduled basis.  It is expected that the contractor will be on-site at least one day per week.
3.	Total number of hours for this contract ? 660

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-08-R-625445 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-23.  This is a unrestricted procurement.  The NAICS is 332999.  

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-913), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND A SEPARATE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 under Simplified Acquisition procedures in Subpart 13.5 as supplemental with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is RFP101188 and is being issued as a Request for Proposal.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-18.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561990. The purpose of this Contract is to engage the services of a contractor to support the Clinical Center Patient representative. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC) is a clinical research hospital providing all medical services for patients participating in human research protocols of the NIH. The CC provides patient facilities and services for clinical investigations by the NIH Institutes, research in related areas and supervises residency and other training programs. 

?Professional Services Contract Statement of Work?

The contractor will serve as assistant to the Clinical Center Patient Representative (PR). He/ she will be responsible for contacting patients and family members as assigned, who are seeking assistance from the PR office. He/ she will work closely with the PR to insure a seamless response to expressed concerns and a coordinated approach to hospital staff, administrators, Institute staff and others needed to resolve the problems. He/ she will investigate patient/ family complaints and develop a plan of action in concert with the PR. Effective communication with staff at all levels of the organization ? administrators, clinical research staff, and Institute staff ? as well as clinicians and many others outside the hospital will make successful resolution possible.

The contractor, working with the PR, will be involved in the continued development of systematic data management that maintains the confidentiality of patients, while meeting the needs of the organization in a more comprehensive, consistent, and apparent manner.  

The contractor will help the PR to develop a systematic pro-active approach to patients and families in the outpatient clinics. Currently, inpatients are contacted routinely and made aware of the PR program, and there are numerous professional staff available to them on the patient-care unit. The outpatients are not given this same support. Their contact with staff is considerably less and often they are faced with complex problems to handle on their own. 

The contractor will contact patients and families, assigned by the PR, in follow-up to determine the outcome of intervention by the PR office. He/ she will be responsible for helping the PR to develop a system for responding to whatever needs remain unmet and maintaining contact with the individual(s) until a more complete resolution of the problem or concern occurs. 

With the increase in requests to the PR office for consent-monitoring, the contractor will work with clinical research teams as assigned, and provide consent-monitoring when appropriate from a patient-advocacy point of view. Together, the PR and the contractor will determine the most appropriate situations for providing this service. Communication about these cases with both the Clinical Bioethics Department and the NIMH Psychiatric Consult Service will continue in an ongoing way to provide the optimal service to patients and families.

The contractor will help the PR to evaluate the PR volunteer program and to assess its changing needs and focus. He/ she will help to re-direct and re-train current volunteers as appropriate and necessary.

Working closely with the PR, the contractor will review very complex cases, will help to determine the best approach to handle them and will participate in evaluation of the outcome. 

Using professional skills and experience, the contractor will work with the PR to identify areas within the NIH clinical research program for enhancing patient advocacy. Both will work together to describe this model of patient advocacy within a clinical research setting with presentations in appropriate settings and in written materials to be submitted for publication in professional journals.
