<DESC>Objective:  The Strategic Studies Institute (SSI) of the United Stated Army War College (USAWC) uses its Academic Engagement Program to seek collaborative and  mutually beneficial conceptual research partnerships with distinguished academic and other institutions to address key national security issues.  Partnering with the US Army War College will assist selected institutions in becoming or continuing as centers of excellence for the study of national security.  Although there are many informal methods for encouraging collaboration, this request for proposal (RFP) solicits specific formal partnership through the conduct of scholarly colloquia designed to produce conceptual research and publishable unclassified works absent copyright restrictions.   The normal end products of the academic colloquia envisioned by this RFP are scholarly presentations, research papers, monographs or books published by the SSI.  The research products assess and make recommendations on strategic issues and national security policies important to the Army and are used in the professional development of USAWC faculty and students.  Additionally, SSI distributes its publications to key leaders in the Army and Department of Defense (DOD), the broader military educational system, Congress, the media, other domestic and international think tanks and defense institutes, and major colleges and universities.<br><br>Project Goals:  The U.S. Army, the USAWC and SSI will obtain value from these colloquia as indicated by the following goals:  <br><br>(1)	Engage noted scholars, leading practitioners, and other strategic thinkers in presentation, dialogue and debate of key national security issues important to the U.S. Army.<br><br>(2)	Publish scholarly and influential papers and reports that address critical challenges and initiatives that affect the U.S. Army's future in relation to the key issues.<br><br>(3)	Establish and build upon mutually rewarding relationships with the various organizations represented by colloquia participants, as well as the participants themselves.<br><br>(4)	Engage the US Army in multi-national dialogue with fellow militaries and leading academic researchers.<br><br>(5)	Ensure the freshness and relevancy of the USAWC curricula through timely, critical, and independent research and analysis.<br><br>(6)	Contribute to the strategic thought under-girding U.S. national security policy and strategy and significantly expand the base of knowledge through various publication media including printed products.<br><br>BACKGROUND:  The SSI is the U.S. Army's research organization for the analysis of national security policy and military strategy.  SSI is part of the USAWC at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania and its research provides direct analysis for the professional development and use of USAWC faculty and students as well as Army and DOD leadership, and the Institute serves as a bridge to the wider national security intellectual community.  SSI employs the Academic Engagement Program to build and sustain relationships between SSI and outstanding scholars in the global strategic studies community while supplementing SSI's research and analysis capabilities to produce products useful to those who study, teach, and practice national security and military strategy, within the Army and DOD.  This program seeks premier academic institutions to host colloquia on key strategic issues of interest to the Army that allow SSI scholars and other Army personnel to interact with leading scholars and government officials who are most knowledgeable and influential in the field of study.  The purpose of the colloquia is not only to produce publications that have inherent credibility but also to expose scholars and military personnel at the USAWC to a diverse group of expert participants, with whom they would not otherwise be able to interact.<br><br>REFERENCES / APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS:  <br><br>a.	Strategic Studies Institute web site:  http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/ <br><br>b.	"Publishing with SSI" at: http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/publishing/<br><br>c.	"Key Strategic Issue List" at: http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/ksil.cfm<br><br>Basis for Contract Award:<br><br>(1)  This is a best value source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Source Selection, as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and the Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFARS).  The Government will select the best overall offers, based upon an integrated assessment of Mission Capability, Past Performance, and Price Factor. The Government anticipates awarding more than one contract to the offers who are deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR, as supplemented, whose proposal conforms to the solicitation's requirements (to include all stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information required by 52.212-2, Evaluations, of this solicitation) and are judged by an overall assessment of the evaluation factors and subfactors to represent the most advantageous choices to the Government.  As part of making the assessment, a best value analysis will be performed determining whether or not exceeding the minimum requirements at an associated price provides the best value to the Government. The government reserves the right to select for award, all, some or none of the offers received and make multiple awards on a best value basis.<br><br>(2)  As a basis for award, trade-offs between price and non-price factors are permitted.  Therefore, the Government reserves the right to award contracts to other than the lowest proposed price. However, the degree of importance of price as a factor in determining award could become greater depending upon the equality of the proposals evaluated in the non-price factors.  The greater the equality of proposals within the non-price factors, the more important price becomes in selecting the best value to the Government. The Government will evaluate proposed prices for reasonableness using price analysis techniques.  Proposed prices evaluated as unreasonable may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition.<br><br>It is estimated that the RFP will be released on or about 26 August 2011 with a closing date on or about 15 October 2011. The actual beginning and closing date will be on the RFP itself. TO REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION, SEND AN EMAIL TO timothy.s.karol@us.army.mil Phone requests will not be honored.

<p>C3 Provision 952.233-0001 C3 Agency Protest Program (Nov 2010)<br />(a) This solicitation may be protested to the issuing Contracting Office for decision by the Contracting Officer or by the Chief of the Regional Contracting Center if authority has been withheld. If requested, an independent review of an Agency Protest decision is available through appeal to the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC)/Senior Contracting Official (SCO) in accordance with FAR 33.103. A protest to C3 is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103. The C3 Agency Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within C3, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. After an interested party files an Agency Protest with the Contracting Officer and while that protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the Agency Protest, the Agency Protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>(b) An interested party may file a written protest to the Contracting Officer under the C3 Agency Protest program for contract solicitations issued by C3. Such Agency Protests are limited to objections to any of the following:</p>
<p>(1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.<br />(2) The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.<br />(3) An award or proposed award of the contract.<br />(4) A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.</p>
<p>(c) An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (f) of this provision for resolution of protests.</p>
<p>(d) For the purpose of filing a C3 Agency Protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.</p>
<p>(e) An Agency Protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number or e-mail address; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of Contracting Officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an Agency Protest for decision by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(f) C3 Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from SSgt Jonathan Roddy at Jonathan.Roddy@afghan.swa.army.mil.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples.(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.(2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

Length of service<br>includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br>successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br>performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)<br><br>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br>King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br>Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.  (A<br>contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br>accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4174)<br><br><br><br>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:<br><br>1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br>not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br>administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because<br>most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br>not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br>week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br>400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br>within those job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not<br>list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br>data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br>$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For<br>example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br>within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br>occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br>then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br>conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br>determination.<br><br>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br>industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br>professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br>who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br>    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br>consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br>specifications;<br>    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br>modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br>related to user or system design specifications;<br>    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br>programs related to machine operating systems; or<br>    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br>requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).<br><br>2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you<br>work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br>and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br> If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br>regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br>premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br>(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br>overtime work).<br><br><br>HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br>employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br>in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This<br>includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br>ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br>and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br>  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br>on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations<br>involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.<br><br>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br>represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br>ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br>which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br>employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br>like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br>All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br>incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials<br>are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br>ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.<br><br>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **<br><br>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br>(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br>local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br>laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br>employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br>determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br>following standards as compliance:<br><br>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br>adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br>cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br>the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br>this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br>agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br>affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br>and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in<br>those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br>materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br>not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br>laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br>of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br>there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.<br><br>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br>"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br>unless otherwise indicated.

Such<br>conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br>fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br>the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br>of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br>be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br>When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br>should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br>conformed.<br><br>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:<br><br>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br>occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).<br><br>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br>proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br>proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br>rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br>authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br>representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the<br>contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br>performs any contract work.<br><br>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br>of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br>information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br>and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br>for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).<br><br>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br>disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br>notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br>the request.<br><br>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.<br><br>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.<br><br>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.<br><br>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br>Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br>that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br>wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br>determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br>Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br>classifications listed in the wage determination.<br><br>FAR 52.204-7.

<p>The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has the broad mission to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology through research and development in information technology, mathematics, and statistics. As part of their research on Virtual Measurements and Analysis, the High Performance Computing and Visualization Group in ITL operates a fully immersive hardware and software environment. This environment requires real time visualization and analysis to maintain the sense of immersion. The frame rate gives the rendering speed in frames per second (FPS) and is the metric that reports the performance of the hardware and software together. NIST scientific visualization applications are requiring more and more performance. The frame rate is the limiting factor in what can be shown immersively.</p>
<p>A key component of the software in the NIST immersive environment is the Open Scene Graph (OSG) software. OSG is an open source high performance 3D graphics software toolkit, used by application developers in fields such as visual simulation, games, virtual reality, scientific visualization and modeling.</p>
<p>A problem in this system has been observed where parallel, multi-threaded applications do not scale properly to multiple graphics cards resulting in low frame rates.</p>
<p>This procurement addresses a requirement for a contractor to develop a fix for the above problem. The Contractor shall provide services in accordance with the attached Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>All responsible offerors that can meet the attached requirements are invited to submit quotations in accordance with the instructions below.</p>
