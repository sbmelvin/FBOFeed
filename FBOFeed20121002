However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR LIGHT SPORT POWERED PARACHUTE LAND AIRCRAFT PILOT TRAINING FOR FLIGHT STANDARDS OPERATIONS INSPECTORS AND AIRCRAFT CERTIFICATION PILOTS EMPLOYED BY THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA).

NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EITHER MAILED, FAXED OR EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING SPECIALIST.  CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW.
This is a market survey for a Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Requirements Type Contract.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore, any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.  
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) certified firms, and all other business types and sizes, capable of providing specified Course Instruction.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RECOVERY<br /></span>Funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009<br />Pre-Solicitation Notice</strong><br /><strong>Project Title</strong>:  Program and Technical Services in Support of Department of Commerce (DOC) Office of Inspector General's (OIG) Audits and Oversights of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration's (NTIA), Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP)<br /><br />THIS PROJECT WILL BE FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009. This pre-solicitation notice is hereby issued in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.704.<br /><br />This pre-solicitation notice is for the same requirement as was detailed in the Sources Sought Notice Reference No. GG000000-12-04019.  However, changes may have been made to the requirement since the posting of the Sources Sought Notice.  Whether or not a company responded to the Sources Sought Notice has no bearing on their eligibility to respond to the forthcoming solicitation.<br /><br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-5, directed the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) of the Department of Commerce to create the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), a matching grant program to expand broadband access to unserved and underserved areas of the United States.  The Recovery Act authorized BTOP $4.7 billion that resulted in $3.9 billion for 121 infrastructure grants, 65 public computing center grants, and 43 sustainable broadband adoption grants, as of September 30, 2011.  NTIA awarded the approximately 230 BTOP grant awards worth about $3.9 billion to a variety of recipients that include public entities, for-profits, nonprofits, and tribal entities.  Awards were made in three major areas: program infrastructure, public computer centers, and sustainable broadband adoption.  Awards went to each of the states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The projects are required to be completed in three years with all awards scheduled for completion by September 30, 2013.
<p>Also, the Recovery Act required NTIA to transfer $10 million of BTOP funds to the Office of Inspector General for audits and oversight of BTOP grants.  A $302 million rescission occurred in August 2010 pursuant to Pub. L. No. 111-226, reducing the total funding from $4.7 million to around $4.4 million.  The remaining funds went to develop and update a publicly searchable National Broadband Map, administrative expenses, and transfers to the Federal Communications Commission for the development of the nation broadband plan.</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is for a contractor to assist the OIG in conducting audits and oversight into programs and operations of the NTIA's Broadband Technology Opportunities Program.  The OIG keeps the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, and Congress informed of serious problems and deficiencies relating to the administration of the Department's programs and operations, recommends corrective actions, and reports on the progress made in implementing corrective actions. The contractor will be responsible for both performance and financial audits.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541219 with a small business size standard of $8.5 million. Contracting by Negotiation shall be utilized under the authority of FAR Part 15. This requirement will be 100% set-aside for small business. A firm-fixed price contract is anticipated.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFP number SB1304-13-RP-0002.</p>
<p>Potential offerors shall be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related Amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted. It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential Offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation. The Government will not maintain a mailing list.</p>
<p>Any communication regarding this requirement must be made in writing and forwarded via email to keith.bubar@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>Offerors shall be actively registered in the System for Award Management website at www.sam.gov, in order to be eligible to receive a contract under this solicitation.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates posting the solicitation approximately 15 days after the date of publication of this notice.</p>

  Offerors will be evaluated using the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Method.  In order to permit efficient competition, the Navy will utilize the following methodology:  Proposal will initially be screened for price and placed in order of price (lowest price to highest price).  The Navy will then evaluate the technical factors of the five (5) lowest priced proposals.  The Navy will make award to the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal from among the five (5) lowest priced proposals.  However, the Navy, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to increase the number of proposals it will review under this methodology.  Accordingly under this methodology, the technical factors of some proposals may not be evaluated by the Navy.
  Proposers are advised that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions or any contract concerning the proposals received.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms. Proposers should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  If discussions are deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer, all proposals will be evaluated (both technical and price) for the purpose of establishing a competitive range.
The solicitation and resulting contract award will be a performance-based service acquisition made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the Request for Proposals (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other evaluation factors considered.
  The offeror's proposal shall contain a response to each of the evaluation factors and shall be in the form prescribed by the solicitation.  The solicitation requires the evaluation of price and the following non-price factors: Factor 1  Technical Approach/Management, Factor 2  Corporate Experience, Factor 3  Safety, and Factor 4  Past Performance. NOTE: Offerors MUST be evaluated as technically ACCEPTABLE under factors 1, 2, 3 and 4 in order to be considered technically acceptable overall.
Offers shall be submitted for the performance of work for a period of one year.  However, the initial term of the contract may be for a period of less than one year.  The Government has the option to extend the term of the contract services for additional periods of one to twelve months.
  The total contract term, including the exercise of any options, shall not exceed 60 months.  
The proposed procurement will be issued as a NAVFAC Electronic Facilities Support Contract with online ordering capability using DOD EMALL for the Indefinite Quantity Exhibit Line Item Numbers (ELINs).  Acceptance of Government Purchase Credit Cards is required along with the purchase of DOD EMALL Encrypted Software.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 561720 with a size standard of $16.5M.  
The proposed procurement listed herein is set-aside for 8(a) certified firms only.  The RFP will be available in electronic format only (Adobe Acrobat (.pdf)) and will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website on or about October 16, 2012.
  Estimated proposal due date shall be at least 30 days after the RFP is posted.   Technical inquiries must be submitted in writing to Pamela Waller (pamela.waller@navy.mil) 15 days prior to the RFP due date.

HOWEVER, IT IS THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OFFEROR TO CONTINUALLY VIEW THE WEBSITE FOR CHANGES.

<SUBJECT>RFI - Software Integration for Crime and Threat Analysis
<SOLNBR>N00173-13-R-RH01
<RESPDATE>120112
<CONTACT>Richard W. Hobson, Email richard.hobson@nrl.navy.mil
<DESC>Adversarial Modeling &amp; Exploitation Office<br />DRAFT RFI: TASR Market Survey<br />Date: 09/25/12
<p>I. Purpose</p>
<p>Through this request for information (RFI) document, the Adversarial Modeling &amp; Exploitation Office (AMX), US Naval Research Lab seeks to identify software systems for possible inclusion and integration in a suite of crime and threat analysis tools for the Federal Protective Service (FPS). Specifically, we are interested in software applications developed by U.S. personnel which could be utilized for crime analysis, spatial analysis, or intelligence analysis by the law enforcement community. Software systems could include, but not be limited to, those which are currently utilized by organizations including municipal police departments, county and state crime and intelligence analysis centers, and by Federal organizations.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for market research, planning and information purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the government pay for information solicited hereunder. All information received will be treated as public knowledge. Any piece of proprietary or confidential information should be clearly marked.</p>
<p>II. Background<br />The FPS provides policing and security services to nearly all Federal buildings in the United States. It has approximately 1,200 sworn personnel and oversees the efforts of approximately 12,000 armed security personnel. The FPS is responsible for not only protecting Federal property, but also Federal employees, and the immediate geographic area surrounding Federal property. FPS personnel are therefore responsible for assessing and responding to information and intelligence at the local, state, and federal level.</p>
<p>The Adversarial Modeling and Exploitation Office, US Naval Research Lab is involved in an ongoing project with the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&amp;T) to assist the FPS to more efficiently and effectively use information. This effort is known as the Threat Analysis Systems Requirement (TASR) project. Through the TSAR Project, we are seeking to develop a full threat and crime analysis system specification for the FPS. The goal of this project is to identify and later develop tools which will assist them to use available data more efficiently and effectively to deploy resources and protect against threats.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice with market research questions attached.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from qualified small businesses and to conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 (please see attached market research questions).  No solicitation is being issued at this time.  This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.  

The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB), Colorado, seeks potential sources, with specific interest in small business capability, to perform Hardness Maintenance/Hardness Surveillance (HM/HS) and High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) Technical Support for Headquarters, Air Force Space Command (HQ AFSPC), Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB), Colorado.  This requirement provides HM/HS, HEMP verification testing, HEMP surveys and engineering studies, and HEMP training materials for a wide range of current HEMP protection systems world-wide (see attached draft PWS).  The contractor shall furnish all labor, tools, equipment, and material necessary to accomplish the requirements.  Work under this contract will require security clearances of Secret and Top Secret.  

For reference purposes, the solicitation, when issued, will be numbered FA2517-12-R-9006 and will be a Request for Proposal (RFP).  A best value source selection will likely be the method of contractor selection.  It is anticipated the contract(s) will have a five-year performance period.  The program is valued at approximately $12 million. This HEMP protection program spans across various mission systems, sites and facilities.  The Government is contemplating award of one firm fixed price contact.  

The Government has determined that the North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code most appropriate for this procurement is 517110, Wired Communications Carriers.  The small business size standard is 1,500 employees. No decision has yet been made regarding the small business strategy for this contract.  Small businesses wishing to influence the Contracting Officers decision regarding a small business set-aside are urged to respond to this announcement and the attached market research questions via e-mail to jeane.steed@us.af.mil.  If this procurement results in a small business set-aside, small businesses are advised that FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, would apply wherein at least 50 percent of the work must be performed by the small business prime contractor alone.  

Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this notice or any follow-up information requests is voluntary and shall be treated as confidential.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with this or future requests.  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as amendments to this announcement.  All amendments will be available for viewing at this website, FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.eps.gov.  

It is incumbent upon interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents.  Although a deviation is currently in place for registration in the System for Award Management (SAM), formerly Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and for FAR 52.204-8, Annual Representations and Certifications, offerors should note this deviation is provisional, and requirements for registration in this system at http://www.sam.gov will recommence at some point.

Your response to the attached market research questions is certainly appreciated.

<CONTACT>Tameka N Davis, Phone 301-619-1677, Email tameka.davis@med.navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to solicit a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY as defined in FAR 15.201(e). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources to provide patient-based, image-related dose tracking software for the US Navy. The intent is to monitor patient dose across all Navy medical facilities and all imaging modalities utilizing ionizing radiation.
<p>BACKGROUND: US Navy medicine provides state-of-the-art imaging services to active duty personnel and their dependents as well as military retirees. Medical imaging using ionizing radiation is an important tool for non-invasively assessing and diagnosing various medical conditions and disease. High quality imaging does require the use of x-rays that may result in a small risk to patients. The US Navy intends to provide high quality imaging in a low dose manner and requires centrally accessible patient dose tracking software by the end of fiscal year 2013. The requirements for patient dose tracking software are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Patient Dose Information: The US Navy requires modality-specific dose metric information such as CTDIvol, DLP, KAP or DAP as reported in the vendor DICOM structured report or using validated optical character recognition (OCR) techniques for stripping pertinent data from screen saves. The Navy prefers to obtain patient-specific (e.g., size, weight, age) equivalent organ dose and whole body effective dose. The Navy also prefers access to all related variables and parameters such as conversion coefficients and patient-size coefficients.</p>
<p>2. Modality Support: The US Navy requires vendor neutral support for computed tomography (CT) and prefers support for digital and computed radiography, fluoroscopy, mammography, mammographic tomosynthesis, nuclear medicine as well as combined modalities.</p>
<p>3. Dose Reporting: The US Navy requires individual and cumulative dose tracking with reporting/filtering by technician, referring physician, interpreting radiologist; by scanner, study name/protocol, imaging parameter (kVp or mAs) or anatomical; or by department, facility, or region. Reporting dashboards should be flexible without programming support and the system should generate alerts based on protocol settings, patient-specific dose, or user-defined limits. Data should be updated in near real-time with controlled, user-defined access. The Navy prefers a system that provides automated mapping of anatomic regions or organs based on information available through DICOM archives such as image data and image metadata rather than the radiology information system (RIS). Mapping algorithms should be validated.</p>
<p>4. Information Technology (IT): The US Navy requires that the solution be a browser-based application, can receive DICOM/RIS and HL7 data, can integrate with commercial Picture Archive and Communication Systems (PACS) and may integrate with dictation or transcription systems. The US Navy is divided into two regions, NAVMEDWEST and NAVMEDEAST. Data should be accessible within and between regions and accessible to the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED). <br /><br />5. Installation: Vendor shall meet Department of Defense (DoD) Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) requirements for installation on the DoD network.</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Please provide the following business information for your company/institution and for any teaming or joint venture partners: Company/Institution Name, Address, Point of Contact, Cage Code, Phone Number, Email address, and Webpage URL, business size standard, and business classification and a statement as to whether your company is domestically or foreign owned (if foreign, please indicate the country of ownership).</p>
<p>Respondents should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly. Capability statements should be e-mailed to Tameka Davis at Tameka.davis@med.navy.mil. If contractors are unable to provide a response that encompasses all of the requests detailed above, an email explaining why this isn't feasible is appreciated.</p>
<p>Responses shall be submitted NO LATER THAN 31 October 2012. Please limit responses to no more than 20 pages. Marketing materials are not a sufficient response to this RFI. A point of contact that can speak for the responding company should be identified to support further Government inquiries as well as explanations that might be needed with regard to the information provided.</p>

<DESC>The National Labor Relations board (NLRB) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to gain knowledge of Federal Contract Writing Software (CWS) solutions that comply with the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Financial Management Line of Business (FMLOB) initiative. The intent of this announcement is to acquire information from interested parties to assist the NLRB in developing an understanding of public and private sector capability, capacity, and experience in supporting the existing requirements of the NLRB Contract/Procurement Management. From this information, the NLRB plans to develop an acquisition strategy and procure the required software and services from an OMB designated Federal Government Shared Service Provider (SSP) or commercial vendor.&nbsp;All software and services will be obtained though a forthcoming single public-private competition that will result in the selection of one SSP or one commercial prime-contractor.<br />&nbsp;<br />The NLRB will accept responses to this RFI in the form of a narrative description of capabilities which clearly address this requirement. Interested parties may request a timeslot for a short presentation in addition to providing a capabilities narrative. Timeslots are limited, and depending on response not all requests may be honored. <strong><em>The request for a time slot should be made in a cover letter accompanying the capabilities narrative.</em></strong> Please limit the size of this capabilities narrative to less than 25 pages.<br /><br />In accordance with FAR 10.001(a)(3), the NLRB intends to use the information received to better understand the offerings of the Federal Shared Service Providers and determine if commercial providers are available. Upon completion of this knowledge gathering, the NLRB anticipates finalizing a Solicitation package, which will contain the following materials:<br /><br />&bull; A Request For Proposal (RFP) containing a Statement of Work (SOW), Instructions to Offerors regarding the submission of both Technical and Price Proposals, Evaluation Criteria, information about required operational capability demonstrations, and applicable general terms and conditions.<br />&nbsp;
<p>&bull; A system requirements document containing the functional and technical<br />requirements, consisting of applicable FSIO requirements and NLRB-specific requirements.</p>
<p>Once the Solicitation has been issued, all Offerors, whether from the public or private sector, will have the opportunity to submit a written Technical Proposal and a written Price Proposal. As part of the proposal, NLRB will require the Offerors to formally demonstrate their ability to meet the NLRB's requirements in key technical areas.<br />&nbsp;<br />Subsequently, the NLRB will make the award selection. Selection of the service provider will be conducted in accordance with the OMB's memorandum, Competition Framework for Financial Management Lines of Business Migrations, dated May 22, 2006, the Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO) FMLoB Migration Planning Guidance [Version 1], dated September 13, 2006, and applicable provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).</p>
<p><em><strong>Please note, this RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. It is not a Solicitation Announcement for proposals, and no contract shall be awarded from this Announcement. No reimbursement will be made for costs associated with providing information in response to this Announcement or to any follow-up information requests. Hard copies of this notice are not available. </strong></em></p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS MARKET RESEARCH. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice.<br /><br />The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has a need to obtain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of the Small Business Community to include but not limited to Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUB-Zone), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) to compete and perform a potential Firm Fixed Price Level of Effort IDIQ Contract. <br /><br />NGA intends to award on a competitive basis an administrative service contract for the Enterprise Support for Administrative Services (ESAS) program. This acquisition activity would provide administrative support across the agency upon completion of the current Administrative Services contract, which has a period of performance end date of 30 June 2013.<br /><br />ESAS anticipates a labor category structure that would support Executive and non-Executive leadership level offices across the agency. This may consist of Executive labor categories for those offices with Senior Executive Service (SES)/Defense Intelligence Senior Leader (DISL), and Secretary labor categories Services for all other offices (or as needed to perform the standard administrative tasks not requiring an Executive labor category). Note: The exact labor category structure is still being defined. The scope difference between the Executive Administrator and Secretary would differ in complexity (both quantifiably and qualitatively). It is foreseen that the Level of office within the organization and level of administrative responsibilities would determine the labor category required. Regardless of the level, contractors placed on the ESAS contract would be expected to provide the highest level of administrative support.<br /><br />Depending on the final requirements definition and the labor category structure and description, the candidates selected to support the ESAS contract may be required to meet certain educational and/or training requirements in addition to having an adequate number of years of work experience in the administrative career field. Contractor personnel proposed to support NGA administrative requirements shall have been fully interviewed screened, and had their qualifications verified through references and/or prior experience with the ESAS contractor. This is to ensure the upmost professionalism, character, aptitude, and qualifications to meet the administrative requirements of NGA's various offices. Contractor personnel assigned to the ESAS contract will be expected to present a professional appearance and demeanor, and demonstrate excellent office etiquette.<br /><br />ESAS contractor personnel would work on-site at NGA Campus East (NCE) and NGA Campus West (NCW) locations, but other CONUS and OCUNUS locations may be realized at a later date. The core work hours would occur primarily between 0600 and 1800 hours with occasional support required outside of these hours. An occasional instance of overtime may occur with some offices more than others. Travel may also be required but this is not expected to occur often. Contractor administrative personnel supporting ESAS shall possess a TS/SCI security clearance; and who can be vetted by NGA's security adjudication (i.e. crossover) process to enable placement within 21 business days or less.<br /><br />Offices with ESAS administrative requirements would expect uninterrupted support. Therefore, sources interested in this notice that may eventually be given the opportunity to bid on ESAS would need to ensure a management approach that enables continuous administrative support during times of temporary absence and vacancy.
<p>The following notionally summarizes the potential responsibilities and expectations foreseen for ESAS administrative labor category levels. ESAS would basically be expected to provide A-to-Z administrative support. In general, this involves ensuring the office administrative executes in an efficient and organized manner to achieve all daily office requirements. In some cases this could include scope that may overlap other contractor support activities, but more constrained in terms of the administrative career field. It is expected that all work completed reflect knowledge and understanding of NGA and the home organization, policy and guidance, administrative responsibilities, and business rhythms and processes. Such administrative support would extend across various functional areas (i.e., NGA Front Office, Protocol, Health Clinic, Source, Analysis &amp; Production, Military Support, etc). While similar administrative requirements could be expected across NGA, each office would have unique administrative requirements specific to supporting the mission of that office. ESAS must therefore embrace the necessary flexibility that may be required to accommodate different administrative support needs across the agency.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secretary Services</span></strong> <br />This level of support provides general secretarial support and may be structured into sub-levels (e.g., Secretary vs. Senior Secretary; Secretary Level 1 &amp; 2, etc.). Again, the exact labor category structure is still being defined. In regards to scope effort, the Secretary positions would in general perform an array of clerical and administrative duties with customer service at the forefront. They would maintain a close and highly responsive relationship to the day-to-day activities of the office and staff. NGA offices would expect all work to be completed on-time and fairly independent with minimum guidance in completing secretarial and clerical duties. The following is a list of potential secretary duties that is not all inclusive and therefore should be considered as examples:<br /><br />1. Manage all aspects of office calendars inclusive of scheduling appointments and meetings. <br />2. Perform receptionist and escort responsibilities as required. <br />3. Communicate with leadership, office staff and personnel, as well as visitors to ensure timely execution of responsibilities.<br />4. Prepare reports, memos, letters, and other office documents using word processing, spreadsheets, databases or presentation software. <br />5. Handle routine office situations without little to no assistance.<br />6. Maintain proper files to include establishing and maintaining computer based records/files (e.g. document logs, supply management, personnel information, office expenditures). <br />7. Support office performance reporting responsibilities.<br />8. Retrieve, open mail and control mail distribution. <br />9. Answer telephones and give information to callers, take messages, or transfer calls to appropriate individuals.<br />10. Oversee the planning, scheduling and facilitation of all meeting requirements to include operating Video Teleconference (VTC) sessions, taking meeting minutes, providing post-meeting minutes/reports, recording and tracking actions, and so forth.<br />11. Review documents in accordance with the Agency's correspondence procedures; manage all office correspondence; and track actions such as agency-controlled correspondence. <br />12. Edit and re-format agency-controlled correspondence in accordance with agency procedures. <br />13. Prepare travel itineraries and arrangements (i.e. coordinating itinerary, booking flights, rental cars, accommodations, etc).<br />14. Prepare Read-Ahead Books, Travel Books and other support tools that may be required.<br />15. Maintain PeopleSoft data with periodic updates as they occur or as necessary.<br />16. Provide administrative support to ensure accurate accountability of property management data/equipment. <br />17. Proficiently operate office equipment such as fax machines, copiers, scanners and phone systems; and computer software such as spreadsheet, word processing, database management, and other applications. <br />18. Follow Government furnished directives, instructions, and Standard Operating Procedures, etc. <br />19. Accomplish pre- and post-travel administrative requirements for supporting office.<br />20. Support the on-time completion of office "taskers" both internally and externally using corporate processes and systems. <br />21. Provide administrative support in arranging office functions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Executive Administrative Services<br /></strong></span>The scope of effort at the Executive Administrative level would basically consist of all administrative duties as that of a Secretary, but at a higher level of complexity with shorter timelines, and competing amongst multiple priorities. Note that this level of support may be structured into sub-levels (e.g. Senior Executive Administrator vs. Executive Administrator; Executive Administrator Level 1 &amp; 2; etc.). <br /><br />At the executive administrative support level, contractor personnel would be expected to efficiently support the SES/DISL level personnel and their immediate staff with little to no day-to-day guidance. Executive leadership would expect administrative support to occur with a certain level of autonomy and preciseness. This would include independently solving office problems, supporting overall management of office activities, managing multiple calendars, juggling multiple priorities, executing office actions using corporate applications, making travel arrangements that often involves a dynamic itinerary, conducting basic research, preparing modest reports (e.g. statistical, office), working with databases, spreadsheets and PowerPoint briefing slides, handling information requests, performing clerical functions (e.g. preparing correspondence, copying, arranging documents), receiving and/or escorting senior visitors, and other executive administrative requirements as required. <br />Responses to this notice shall be limited to 5 pages and shall include the following information:<br /><br />(a) Respondent's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address<br />(b) Respondent's interest in bidding on the anticipated future solicitation<br />(c) Respondent's capability to meet personnel requirements to include the number of available personnel with the required clearance level (TS/SCI)<br />(d) Respondent's capability to perform a contract of this magnitude (include work performed within the past 5 years) provide examples<br />(e) Respondent's type of small business and Business Size<br />(f) Respondent's Joint venture, if any - existing and potential<br />(g) Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in finalizing its market research<br /><br />The potential requirement would be for one base year plus four one year options. This potential acquisition is expected to be a 100% Small Business Set-Aside if it is determined that there are an adequate number of small businesses who can fulfill this requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561110 with a size standard of $7 million. <br /><br />Interested parties shall respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis no later than 09:00 AM (EST) 1 June 2012 . All interested contractors must be registered in the CCR to be eligible for award of Government contracts. Mail, fax or e-mail your response to National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Attn: F.

This procurement will  include liquid blood, Needle D Skin Plugs, Cric Skin, Manubrium Skin Plugs and training.  This proposed procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than October 9th, 2012  noon local time. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Point of contact Michele Devine, Contract Specialist, e-mail: michele.g.devine.ctr@us.army.mil <br><br>The following verbiage is directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6).<br><br><br>K Force Government Solutions Inc., is the only vendor in the commercial market that offers this product. It was researched and developed under the Severe Trauma Simulation Army Technology Objective (ATO), TraumaFX was engineered specifically to meet the rigorous requirements of military and civilian training needs. Jointly developed with the U.S. Army RDECOM-ARL-STTC, TraumaFX MATT leverages in-depth human factors requirements analyses of military and civilian training needs to deliver powerfully realistic, yet easy to use training solutions that can be deployed to any location and operated in nearly any weather condition. <br>There is no other simulator on the market that provides this realistic, rugged, remote-control, tetherless training scenario complete with animatronics and special effects. Unlike other trainers, it can be worn by human actors and is compatible with other anthropomorphic trainers. The MATT has packable wounds, multiple tourniquet points, interchangeable priapism and scrotal avulsion and an upper torso that allows a multitude of procedures.  The animatronics give a degree of control to the instructor to advance a training scenario.  Students will learn how to find lifelike anatomical landmarks to execute critical patient treatment without relying on marked indicators. The sole source will avoid duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or the unacceptable delays due to the government.  The purchase of any other unit would reduce the training that the MATT is able to provide.

Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.<br />If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.<br />2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are: <br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. <br />For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. <br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. <br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. <br />4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. <br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. <br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors. <br />3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.<br />5.For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.<br />52.27-103-72 DOJ Contractor Residency Requirement - BOP (JUN 2004)<br />52.242-1502 Evaluation of Contractor Performance Utilizing CPARS (APR 2011) <br />The services, although not directly supervised, shall be reviewed by Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) staff to ensure contract compliance. The contractor's performance will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 42.15. Contract monitoring reports will be prepared by the Contacting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) or Contract Monitor (CM) and maintained in the contract file. <br />In accordance with FAR 42.1502 and 42.1503, agencies shall prepare an evaluation of contractor performance and submit it to the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The BOP utilizes the Department of Defense (DOD) web-based Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to provide contractor performance evaluations.

The contractor will receive an e-mail from the Focal Point thru the following website address webptsmh@navy.milwhen the contract is registered in CPARS.

       (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25.  For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.
 
   (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--
 
     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
 
     (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.

   (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--
 
     (1) __ In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or
 
     (2) __ Outside the United States.
 
   (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
 
     [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--
 
       (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;
 
       (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003- 4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and
 
       (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.
 
     [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003- 4(d)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--

       (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
 
       (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
 
       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)
 
     (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
 
     (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).  If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.
 
     (3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).
 
       [  ] TIN:  _____________________.

E.4 VAAR 852.216-70  ESTIMATED QUANTITIES (APR 1984)

Bids will be considered if made with the proviso that the total quantities delivered shall not exceed a certain specified quantity.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --</p>
<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>(t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR). (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the <br />Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>WAWF<br />EXPEDITE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT<br />(a) This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. For the Department of Defense, the MANDATORY method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.) This means that paper invoices are not permitted and will not be processed for payment. <br />(b) Definitions Important to the WAWF Process<br />Acceptor: The organization or person designated in block 15 of the SF 1449 (cover page of the purchase request) who accepts the products or services tendered. The acceptor has a unique DoDAAC (Department of Defense Activity Address Code) shown in the upper right had box of block 15 that must be used to notify the acceptor that an electronic invoice is pending.<br />DoDAAC: As stated above, an acronym for Department of Defense Activity Address Code. This code unique to each organization in the Department of Defense. Knowledge of what DoDAAC codes must be input into WAWF electronic invoices is crucial to the payment process as it alerts the acceptor that an invoice is pending for acceptance and alerts the payment office that a completed action is ready to process for payment.<br />Payment Office: The location of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) office shown in block 18a of the SF 1449 that will process your electronic invoices. The payment office also has a unique DoDAAC.<br />(c) Options within WAWF include a "combo" for supply items, a 2-in-1 invoice for service contracts and a "stand-alone" invoice. It is recommended that the use of, stand-alone invoices be avoided. The matching of "stand-alone" invoices by DFAS offices requires invoices and receiving reports be separately or individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity and can routinely cause lengthy delays and possible rejection because they do not appear together and therefore must be individually matched and then verified. The use of the "combo" or "2-in-1" does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching. Detailed instructions on how to create an invoice, as well as other topical issues, can be found at the WAWF training website at http://www.wawftraining.com .<br />(d) A key, important, and imperative step for vendors to take is to e-mail notification to the acceptor identified in the contract in block 15 by clicking on the "Send More E-Mail Notifications" link in WAWF upon submission of the electronic invoice instrument (combo or 2-in1). This step provides notice to the acceptor of your pending invoice<br />Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html . For assistance in registering contact:<br />1-866-618-5988<br />COMMERCIAL: 801-605-7095<br />CSCASSIG@CSD.DISA.MIL <br />Helpful training on the use of WAWF for the submission of invoices is available on line at http://www.wawftraining.com. <br />(e) Questions concerning payments:<br />(1) DFAS Limestone at 1-800-756-4571. You will need to have the delivery/purchase/contract number ready when calling about payments.<br />(2) Payment and receipt information can be accessed at the DFAS website https://myinvoice.csd.disa.mil/.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

E.   REPAIR, REPLACEMENT AND SHIPMENT OF PARTS

 contracting official or credit card holder), they must meet the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) standards, and be of equivalent quality.

Following the identification of equipment failure, any/all Government owned assets requiring off-site support will necessitate approval for release from the DGR (or cited contracting official).  Thereafter, the equipment will be shipped (at customer expense) to the service provider for, subsequent, evaluation and submittal of a Service or Bench Estimate, for repair.  The document shall contain a written description of the equipment failure and provide an itemized breakdown that identifies all related charges for parts and labor.  Following receipt/review of the estimate by the DGR, written affirmation will be provided specifying the Governments position and related requirements (if any) for additional supplies and/or services.

All Government owned assets, supported by this agreement and the subject of off-site services requiring return freight, shall be sent using FedEx 2-Day service (covered).

<DESC>It is the Government's intention to procure, via full and open competition, existing commercial vehicles with necessary modifications to meet the requirements identified in the Performance Specification (P-Spec). While the P-Spec provides the performance requirements for the P-19R the following paragraphs identify areas of particular interest to the Government.
<p>Firefighting Capability: The P-Spec identifies the required attributes and capabilities of the P-19 Replacement ARFF Vehicle (P-19R). In normal operational use all fire fighting and rescue efforts must be initiated within five minutes of notification of an incident. Firefighting apparatus must be able to initiate fire fighting and rescue operations within five minutes of notification from either a designated hotspot or from the supported airfield ARFF facility.</p>
<p>Transportability: The P-Spec states the P-19R should be C-17 transportable. It is also the Government's desire to have a vehicle that is similar in size to the current P-19A and weigh no more than 40,000 pounds while still meeting all other requirements of the P-Spec. Vendors should pay particular attention to the limitations for shipboard and rail transportation in the P-Spec and supporting documentation.</p>
<p>RAM: Reliability, Availability and Maintainability are key operational aspects of the P-19R. Vendors must be able to identify if their vehicle systems will be able to achieve the expected level of Material/Operational Availability, Reliability and Maintainability as identified in the P-Spec, based on the specified P-19R operational mission profile.</p>
<p>Fire Suppression System: Protection of the crew from vehicle fires is of special interest to the Government. The P-19A Replacement must meet all current applicable Standard NATO Agreements (STANAG), Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS), U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) 414 Safety Regulations in effect at the time of production. In addition to meeting the above safety standards, the P-19R will, at a minimum, incorporate an Automatic Fire Extinguishing System (AFES) to protect the crew. If available, a system which combines the capabilities of an AFES and a system designed to prevent and extinguish exterior tire fires may be considered for incorporation into in the P-19R Responses should address the capability for adding such a system to the P-19R candidate vehicle, or identify if such a system is currently commercially offered.</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO.(1) TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR PROCUREMENT OF EIGHT NEW AND THE REFURBISHMENT OF THREE LOAD CELLS .  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions generated by vendors in response to this RFQ. QUESTION 1.  Who is the original manufacturer? ANSWER 1.  Original manufacturer of the load cells to be refurbished is Beowulf.  QUESTION 2.  How many bridges do they have and how many mounted strain gages are presently used per bridge? ANSWER 2.  Load Cells to be refurbished have two (2) 350ohm bridges each. Internal configuration is unknown. According to last known calibration data they are 3mV/V.  QUESTION 3.  How are existing load cells to be overhauled presently packaged?  Crate? Pallet? Approximate weight of both load cell & packaging?   Or are we required to crate?  If so, will NASA provide equipment to load onto truck or are we responsible?  Who will pay the shipping/transportation costs? ANSWER 3.  Load cells are currently sitting on a pallet at MSFC high bay area. Vendors should include shipping from MSFC to their site as part of their quote.  We have forklifts here to help load them. QUESTION 4.  Are we to furnish calibration data for each of these specifications?  If so, which points? For eight new load cells specifications: Referance from the Statement Of Work (SOW). 2.15.	Load cells shall be designed to withstand and compensate for off-axis loading for loads applied up to 5 off the primary force vector up to 10% of the load cell's full scale capacity. 2.16.	Load cells shall be designed to withstand without damage at least 10% of the full scale load applied 90 to the primary force vector. 2.17.	Load cells shall be designed to withstand without damage torsion loads of at least 10% of full scale capacity in inch-pounds.  (75,000 in-lbs for 750,000 lb load cell) ANSWER 4.  Relative to requirements 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 the vendor does not need to provide calibration data to demonstrate this specification.  However, NASA does reserve the right to test the design to verify all requirements are satisfied.  If any requirements fail NASA testing, the load cells will not be accepted. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on or before 10/5/2012. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions from industry. As a result, the solicitation is amended as follows:
<p>1. Will the agency supply the contact information for the invited participants? Is there a preferred method of contact with these participants? (mail vs. email - both?)</p>
<p>1A. Names and contact information will be provided. Email messaging is the preferred form of contact with telephone contact following a non-responsive email message attempt by the contractor. The Government estimates that there will be 10 federal employees in attendance and 40 non-federal attendees.</p>
<p>2. Page #4 under Government-Furnished Property, Data, and Information - Please explain the following sentence, "Upon contract award the government will provide all equipment in the instrument design Laboratory along with the computer and phone for the duration of the contract."</p>
<p>2A. The statement is included in the solicitation in error and is hereby deleted in its entirety.</p>
<p>3. Is the contractor responsible for producing other materials (Name badges, table tents, agendas, etc.) in addition to signage? If so, will SWGFEX provide the contractor with approved graphics/logo?</p>
<p>3A. The contractor is responsible for name badges, agendas and direction signs inside the hotel. Table tents are not part of this contract. The Law Enforcement Standards Office at NIST will provide necessary graphics or logos to the contractor upon request.</p>
<p>4. Is the contractor responsible for on-site registration and/or distribution of information to attendees? Please outline contractor's on-site responsibilities in addition to normal facility interactions.</p>
<p>4A. The contractor's responsibilities for the meeting attendees are: on-site registration; ensuring agendas are available for pickup by the attendees at the registration desk; to respond to attendees and address issues regarding lodging, meeting room and general hotel facility. The contractor must be onsite to ensure their negotiated AV/Video/LCD equipment with the hotel functions appropriately during the length of the meeting.</p>
<p>5. Reimbursement -- Can the lodging (3 nights/person) be direct billed to contractor or do you require your travelers to pay their lodging and be reimbursed?</p>
<p>5A. Lodging should be direct billed to the contractor for all non-federal attendees. Exceptions exist for an attending federal employee that must pay for lodging on their own. The contract with the facility shall include rooms "blocked" for the estimated 10 federal attendees to make reservations.</p>
<p>a. Reimbursement would incorporate transportation (air), parking, tolls, taxis, meals, internet, lodging, and any other approved element in the Federal Travel Regulations?</p>
<p>5a. Yes, all of these costs will be direct billed to the contractor for all non-federal attendees. The federal employees will be reimbursed by their employing agencies. Of the estimated 40 non-federal attendees, all will be travelling to the conference from within the continental U.S.</p>
<p>6. Meeting</p>
<p>a. Convenient to transportation - Does this mean close to airport and in walking distance to restaurants? Is there a need to be downtown?</p>
<p>6a. Convenient transportation refers to available shuttle service from the airport to the hotel, 5 - 10 mile taxi ride from airport to the hotel or subway/metro service from the airport to the hotel. A hotel with walking distance to restaurants is highly desirable.</p>
<p>b. Meeting space for 50 - any setup preferred? - are the breakouts equal to 25 each?</p>
<p>6b. Large conference room will have school room/classroom for 50, with a table at the front of the room for speakers/panel participants; the two breakout rooms will have a single conference table set up for 15.</p>
<p>c. Extension cords - Is there a requirement for all 50 participants to set up laptops? have extension cords? and be linked into internet during meetings?</p>
<p>6c. One extension cord with surge protector plugs will be required for each breakout room and two extension cords with surge protector plugs will be required for the large conference room. One at each side of the room along the first row of chairs/tables. Internet access in each of the three rooms is required.</p>
<p>d. Is the same Audio-Visual equipment setup required in the general session room and in each of the breakout rooms?</p>
<p>6d. Yes, all audio-visual equipment is the same for all three rooms.</p>
<p>7. Meals</p>
<p>a. If we can get breakfast and lunch at per diem is that to be included in the hotel contract?</p>
<p>7a. The contractor is responsible to pay for and how they will pay for the provided meals for the non-federal attendees. If the meals are provided for the federal attendees as well, they would be able to account for this under their per diem. This is dependent upon the cost being at or below the government per diem rate.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions from industry. As a result, the solicitation is amended as follows:
<p>Q1. From a previous question in amendment 001 (5), does this mean the contractor has to pay all travel expenses for the attendees in advance and then be reimbursed as part of the contract? What is the reimbursement procedure on these?</p>
<p>A1. The contractor is expected to pay for all costs for the non-federal attendees (approximately 40). The contractor is also required to pay the costs associated with the meeting facilities. The Government would consider the following to assist with the cash-flow during performance of the contract:</p>
<p>i) A milestone payment for the cost of the facilities contract (to include the rooms for the non-federal attendees if appropriate) payable net 15 days from a submission of the signed facilities contract to NIST. The Hotel Room cost must not exceed the Government per diem rate for the selected locality.<br />ii) A not-to-exceed (NTE), cost-reimbursable only Line Item (no fee or profit) for the cost of the airfare/transportation costs for the non-federal attendees. Transportation Costs invoiced must be in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR). Transportation costs could be invoiced as incurred and paid based on Net 15 payment terms; however, the Government would prefer that costs be collected and invoiced no more than once per week. Offeror's shall quote an NTE amount for this Line Item in the quotation submitted in response to this solicitation.<br />iii) Reimbursement to the attendees for per diem, taxi, parking etc. charges will be done after the close of the meeting and attendees have submitted their out-of-pocket costs to the contractor. The offerors shall base their quoted amount for these costs on the expectation of 40 non-federal attendees and these shall be included under the firm-fixed price (FFP) line item.<br />iv) The Government will consider additional milestone payments (for the FFP Line Item) if included in the quotation and considered to be reasonable.</p>
<p>Q2. It is not clear if meals are expected. Is there a required provided lunch? A required provided breakfast?</p>
<p>A2. The offerors can either arrange for meals to be included in the facility/hotel contract or they can provide a per diem (consistent with the JTR) for the non-federal attendees. A combination of this approach would also be acceptable (only lunch, only breakfast, or lunch and breakfast) as long as the quotation is clear as to what is being offered. All offers shall include a per-diem amount for dinner for the non-federal attendees.</p>

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE EBDZ-MCF-001, AMENDMENT 01
<p>AFLCMC/EBDZ will host a Modernized Commodity Fuze Industry Day at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, on 14-15 November 2012. Only companies deemed eligible to receive the Technical Data Package (see Paragraph 7 of the RFI) may attend. A general information session will convene at 0800 Central Standard Time, 14 November in the Eglin Conference Center and is expected to last about 2 hours. Following this session, the government will meet with companies individually upon request. The purpose of these individual breakout meetings is to allow for discussion of company proprietary or sensitive materials or concerns. Any questions coming out of these information exchanges may, at the government's discretion, be sanitized and provided along with answers to all Industry Day attendees afterward.</p>
<p>Companies interested in attending the MCF Industry Day must provide notification NLT 1500 CT, Thursday, 25 October, to Mr. Erik Urban at erik.urban@eglin.af.mil and Ms. Trisha Brinton at trisha.brinton@eglin.af.mil. If a one-on-one session with the government is desired, include that request as part of the notification. Because individual sessions must be scheduled in advance, they will only be available to those companies requesting them prior to the deadline. Following receipt of notification from companies, the government will provide information about base access requirements and, if requested, scheduled time for the one-on-one. Attendance will be limited to no more than 5 people per company. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS INDUSTRY DAY OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.</p>
<p>Clarification to paragraph 5c: Release of MIL-STD-1316F has been delayed with no estimate of release date, thus a version cannot be supplied at this time. Please revert to the latest published version "E" and be advised of the Air Force and Navy safety communities' intent to reinstate the requirement for a visual safe /arm indication for an electromechanical fuze (a major purpose for version "F" of the standard).

<DESC>The Remote Maintenance System Engineering Team (RMSET) located at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires cable hardware to support the Remote Monitor and Logging System (RMLS) national phased deployment from the Maintenance Processor Subsystem (MPS).  The Cable will provide data communications to the RMLS that reduces electron magnetic induced noise and variations in signal ware formats and consist of the following components. Therefore, the FAA is conducting this market survey to seek potential sources capable of meeting technical and delivery requirements.  Specific requirements are identified in the Statement of Work (SOW) attached.  Any vendor that believes it can provide these items is invited to submit a Capability Statement (in contractor format) addressing its abilities to meet all of the requirements identified in the SOW.  
This is anticipated to be a Firm-Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type Contract with a period of performance of one (1) year with three (3), one (1) year options.
At this time the nature of the final competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  Small business participation is highly encouraged.  The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standard code for this requirement is 334119 - Other Computer Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing with a size standard of 1,000 employees. 
All responses (one per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 5 typewritten pages.  No type font less than 11 point may be used.  
PURPOSE: This market survey is designed to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.
The FAA requires proof of documentation from interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and from eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) Program.  
In order to make this determination and to be considered responsive, the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:
a.        Capability Statement (addressing the ability to meet all the requirements identified in the statement of work) b.        Completed Business Declaration Form (attached) c.        Copy of SBA 8(a) Certification Form or proof of documentation from service-disabled veteran-owned small business (if applicable).

<DESC>Adversarial Modeling &amp; Exploitation Office<br />DRAFT RFI: TASR Market Survey<br />Date: 09/25/12
<p>I. Purpose</p>
<p>Through this request for information (RFI) document, the Adversarial Modeling &amp; Exploitation Office (AMX), US Naval Research Lab seeks to identify software systems for possible inclusion and integration in a suite of crime and threat analysis tools for the Federal Protective Service (FPS). Specifically, we are interested in software applications developed by U.S. personnel which could be utilized for crime analysis, spatial analysis, or intelligence analysis by the law enforcement community. Software systems could include, but not be limited to, those which are currently utilized by organizations including municipal police departments, county and state crime and intelligence analysis centers, and by Federal organizations.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for market research, planning and information purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the government pay for information solicited hereunder. All information received will be treated as public knowledge. Any piece of proprietary or confidential information should be clearly marked.</p>
<p>II. Background<br />The FPS provides policing and security services to nearly all Federal buildings in the United States. It has approximately 1,200 sworn personnel and oversees the efforts of approximately 12,000 armed security personnel. The FPS is responsible for not only protecting Federal property, but also Federal employees, and the immediate geographic area surrounding Federal property. FPS personnel are therefore responsible for assessing and responding to information and intelligence at the local, state, and federal level.</p>
<p>The Adversarial Modeling and Exploitation Office, US Naval Research Lab is involved in an ongoing project with the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&amp;T) to assist the FPS to more efficiently and effectively use information. This effort is known as the Threat Analysis Systems Requirement (TASR) project. Through the TSAR Project, we are seeking to develop a full threat and crime analysis system specification for the FPS. The goal of this project is to identify and later develop tools which will assist them to use available data more efficiently and effectively to deploy resources and protect against threats.</p>

<DESC>Adversarial Modeling &amp; Exploitation Office<br />DRAFT RFI: TASR Market Survey<br />Date: 09/25/12
<p>I. Purpose</p>
<p>Through this request for information (RFI) document, the Adversarial Modeling &amp; Exploitation Office (AMX), US Naval Research Lab seeks to identify software systems for possible inclusion and integration in a suite of crime and threat analysis tools for the Federal Protective Service (FPS). Specifically, we are interested in software applications developed by U.S. personnel which could be utilized for crime analysis, spatial analysis, or intelligence analysis by the law enforcement community. Software systems could include, but not be limited to, those which are currently utilized by organizations including municipal police departments, county and state crime and intelligence analysis centers, and by Federal organizations.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for market research, planning and information purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the government pay for information solicited hereunder. All information received will be treated as public knowledge. Any piece of proprietary or confidential information should be clearly marked.</p>
<p>II. Background<br />The FPS provides policing and security services to nearly all Federal buildings in the United States. It has approximately 1,200 sworn personnel and oversees the efforts of approximately 12,000 armed security personnel. The FPS is responsible for not only protecting Federal property, but also Federal employees, and the immediate geographic area surrounding Federal property. FPS personnel are therefore responsible for assessing and responding to information and intelligence at the local, state, and federal level.</p>
<p>The Adversarial Modeling and Exploitation Office, US Naval Research Lab is involved in an ongoing project with the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&amp;T) to assist the FPS to more efficiently and effectively use information. This effort is known as the Threat Analysis Systems Requirement (TASR) project. Through the TSAR Project, we are seeking to develop a full threat and crime analysis system specification for the FPS. The goal of this project is to identify and later develop tools which will assist them to use available data more efficiently and effectively to deploy resources and protect against threats.</p>

This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR 36.6.  This acquisition will be used to procure highly specialized services required to provide continued Architect-Engineer (A-E) design services in support of the Medical Repair and Renewal (MRR) Program.  The MRR program provides quick response to repair/renewal situations relating to the architectural, mechanical, electrical, civil, structural, instrumentation, communications, security, safety, systems, and cost, as well as environmental and hazardous materials abatement areas of Government medical facilities.  Sometimes the Government accomplishes the MRR projects through other design/build contracts; however, some projects will require that an AE prepare a design package (work plan) that will then be executed by a construction contractor under another solicitation.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Huntsville Center is one of the Army's leaders in studies as well as execution, and partners with the Corps' project delivery teams, regional business centers/divisions, stakeholders and geographical districts to provide expertise and the highest quality research facility, life cycle support to the Department of Defense (DoD), other Federal agencies and foreign governments.  In order to accomplish this objective Huntsville Center proposes to award a Restricted Small Business (SB) Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC). The award will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract, with a one (1) year base and four (4) one (1) year options; Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders will be negotiated.  It is anticipated that this acquisition will result in the award of at least three or more indefinite delivery type contract, with the Government reserving the right to award more, less, or none at all if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  Contracts are anticipated to be awarded with FY13 funds.  The North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330.  The total requirements expected to be awarded under the MEDICAL REPAIR AND RENEWAL Program on A-E contracts are anticipated to total approximately $5,000,000 over a period of five (5) years.  This acquisition is a restricted Small Business competitive procurement. <br>1.2  In accordance with FAR 36.209, the A-E Contractor and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for DoD construction design-build contracts that relate to any A-E Task Orders awarded under this contract.

<DESC>1. Introduction
<p>The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is conducting market research to determine qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources. Part of the market research is to publish a Request for Information (RFI) seeking market information on businesses capable of providing the services/products requested.</p>
<p>Contractors choosing to respond to this RFI are cautioned that THIS RFI IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. This RFI is a market research tool used to determine the adequacy of eligible business sources prior to determining the acquisition strategy and issuance of a request for proposal. The Government is not obligated to and shall not pay for any information received from any sources responding to this notice and will not provide any feedback or carry on discussions with non-federal government activities regarding the information provided in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>2. Background<br />The USTRANSCOM and its subordinate command the SURFACE DEPLOYMENT AND DISTRIBUTION COMMAND (SDDC) are requesting information from carriers capable of providing cargo transportation and distribution services using ocean common or contract carriers offering regularly scheduled commercial liner service for requirements that may arise for inbound and outbound cargo to and from the Continental United States (CONUS) to Puerto Rico, Alaska, Hawaii, and Hawaii to Hawaii. Carriers must be capable of providing ocean, intermodal, and related transportation and distribution services to support their offered services as required herein. The general scope of services includes ocean transportation, related intermodal movements and services, and management expertise. Types of cargo carried will be military equipment and supplies, mail, personal vehicles, and other cargo shipped by the U. S. Department of Defense (DoD). Usage of these services will primarily be for requirements sponsored by the DoD. Carriers shall deliver cargo no later than the required delivery date (RDD) specified; provide accurate and timely shipment status reports using the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) or Ocean Carrier Interface (OCI); and deliver cargo to the consignee in the same order and condition as when the cargo was received by the Carrier .</p>
<p>3. Requested Information</p>
<p>The USTRANSCOM and its subordinate command the SURFACE DEPLOYMENT AND DISTRIBUTION COMMAND (SDDC) are requesting carrier information and capabilities per the list below and the attached questionnaire.</p>
<p>a. Name, mailing address, phone number, fax number, and e-mail of designated point of contact<br />b. Company information (include CAGE Code and DUNS)<br />c. Anticipated teaming arrangements (if applicable)</p>
<p>4. Responses</p>
<p>All responses shall be sent via email (not later than 11 October 2012) to the following individuals:</p>
<p>Dorothy Dailey dorothy.dailey@ustranscom.mil 618-220-6728<br />Bill Lindquist bill.linquist@ustranscom.mil 618-220-7089</p>
<p>5. Summary</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY to identify sources that can service&nbsp;inbound and outbound cargo to and from&nbsp;CONUS to Puerto Rico, Alaska, Hawaii, and Hawaii to Hawaii. The information provided in the RFI is subject to change, and is not binding on the Government. USTRANSCOM has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment, or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.<br /><br /><br />The Request for Information (RFI) questionnaire is being amended to remove questions #2 and #10. These two questions aren't applicable for the Regional Domestic Contract requirement. There is a total of 9 questions on the questionnaire now&nbsp;instead of 11 that were originally submitted.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">SYNOPSIS OF AWARD</p>
<p>The 97th Contracting Squadron at Altus AFB, OK has awarded contract FA4419-13-D-0001 to Dale Rogers Training Center (DRTC) of Oklahoma City, OK. This is a firm-fixed price IDIQ type contract for mess attendant services at the Solar Inn dining facility for one year with no option periods. The Solar Inn provides dining services for permanent party military and other special dining occasions. Flight kitchen services are also provided for assigned aircrews and transient flights. The mess attendant services are on the AbilityOne procurement list and therefore procedures under FAR Subpart 8.7 - Acquisition from Nonprofit Agencies Employing People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled were followed. DRTC is the AbilityOne contractor for this type of service in this area and therefore the contract was sole-sourced to DRTC.</p>

<DESC>AAC/PKOB, Eglin AFB, FL, awarded a sole source firm-fixed price contract for one lot (1) of Avionics Interface Units to the 46th Test Wing (TW) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). This requirement is for:
<p>CLIN 0001: Hardware. Data Signal Convertor Set. Set includes Avionics Interface Unit #1 (AIU1) P/N: A05A0247-6 and Avionics Interface Unit #2 (AIU2) P/N: A05A0248-6. Includes Industry Standard 12 Month Warranty from Date of Delivery</p>
<p>The delivery date is 30 June 2014. This award incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-61, 13 Sept 2012. All terms and conditions within the clauses were consistent with commercial item practices. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 531120 with a small business size standard of $7.0M. Interested parties may not identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals/quotes. In accordance with FAR 5.2, Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions, all contract awards must be synopsized through the GPE for actions exceeding $25,000. A proposed contract action synopsis/solicitation was not required for the subject order/contract prior to award due to a determination by the government not to compete this contract, which was based on the procedures of 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. There is a substantial duplication of costs to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Questions shall be submitted electronically to Craig O'Neill at craig.oneill@eglin.af.mil.</p>

<AWDDATE>092812
<ARCHDATE>11022012
<AWARDEE>NYSE Technologies, Inc
<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on behalf of the Department of the Treasury's Office of Debt Management issued a sole source firm-fixed price purchase order for the purchase of one perpetual OneMarketData's OneTick software license, four of NYSE Technologies' BrokerTec feed handlers and services for the installation and configuration of the license and feed handlers to NYSE Technologies.
<p>The period of performance was awarded for date of award - one year with two one-year option periods for software maintenance.</p>
<p>This purchase order was made on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 (a) - only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The value of the award is $1,334,000.00</p>
<p>Justification for other than full and open competition - Only One Source Rationale:<br />"In order to carry out its mission critical market monitoring functions, the Office of Debt Management (ODM) needs the proper monitoring tools. Markets have evolved with technology, and algorithmic, high frequency trading is becoming much more common and impacting market liquidity in new ways that Treasury Policy officials must be able to monitor.</p>
<p>ODM requires a COTS software solution for managing and analyzing large volumes of high frequency for tick data. The term "tick" refers to the change in the price of a security from one trade to the next trade. The need for a high-performance tick database, a complex event processing engine, and analytical tools continues to grow as financial markets continue to move towards electronic and algorithmic trading. Researchers and regulators face numerous data management challenges to address increasing volumes in real-time and historical market data due to increased granularity, changing schemas, consolidation, and order book complexity.</p>
<p>The Treasury's Office of Debt Management, ODM, has a requirement for the purchase of OneTick software database license and four of NYSE Technologies' BrokerTec feed handlers. It has been determined that only OneTick software database license and four of NYSE Technologies' BrokerTec feed handlers will meet all the Government's requirements including being compatible with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY). FRBNY is Treasury's fiscal agent. FRBNY assists ODM in the distribution and sales of Treasury securities. It is critical that the same platform is used in order to ensure that the flow of real-time tick data is not interrupted. If another type of software is used, real time analysis on the high frequency treasury market will not be possible. The capabilities to analyze real time high frequency treasury market data is essential in monitoring liquidity and performing advanced analytics to support Treasury auctions, with the ultimate goal of minimizing the servicing costs of the national debt. In addition, ODM will be able to leverage the application and analysis already done on OneTick software by FRBNY resulting in time and cost savings.</p>
<p>OneTick software is very unique in that it stores high frequency time series data with extremely efficient querying and analysis capabilities, both on real time data and historical data. NYSE Technologies develops the feed handlers to receive BrokerTec tick data that is stored in the OneTick database. NYSE Technologies' feed handlers are not available through any resellers. In addition, NYSE is the only authorized reseller of OneTick, making it the only vendor who could provide the full solution required by the Government."</p>
<p>The Department of the Treasury has identified NYSE Technologies as the sole source for NYSE Technologie's BrokerTec feed handlers. In addition NYSE Technologies of New York, NY is the only authorized reseller of OneMarketData's OneTick software license.</p>
<p>The notice of intent to award to NYSE Technologies was posted on FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR 5.2.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer determined the costs to the Government to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted via the internet and telephone contacts. ODM conducted market research on comparable CEP engine and database products. In the end however, it was determined that only OneMarketData's OneTick software met all of the Government's requirements including being compatible with Treasury's fiscal agent, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRB-NY) system. It was determined that OneMarketData has one authorized reseller: NYSE Technologies. In addition, it was determined that only NYSE Technologies' feed handlers will work with the OneTick software. The market research showed that NYSE Technologies does not have any authorized resellers.</p>
<p>One source expressed an interest in writing in response to the original FBO posting. However, as this procurement includes the brand name purchase of OneMarketData's OneTick software, and that company could not provide OneMarketData's OneTick software, that company was not considered.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to search the market place for solutions that will meet the Government's needs. However, the Government will continue to search for other authorized resellers of both OneTick software and BrokerTec feed handlers so that competition can be achieved on future procurements.</p>
<p>The Contracting officer certifies that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement.

Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ . 

Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). Quoter's must be registered in WAWF to be considered for award unless government purchase card is utilized for procurement. Registration can be completed on-line at https://wawf.eb.mil. The WAWF Assistance Line is also available at 1-866-618-5988.

 Quoter's shall include a completed copy of 52.212-3 and its ALT I with quotes unless vendor is registered in ORCA. If registered, please so state on quote and affirm representations and certifications are up to date. 

Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements. When submitting a quote it is very important that all offerors understand it is their responsibility to ensure they meet all requirements of the RFQ, not just those requirements stated in the specification such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications. The quote should not simply rephrase or restate the Governments requirements, but rather shall provide substantiation as to how the offeror intends to meet the requirements.

Past Performance Requirement: 
The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms.
 Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.
  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoters past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.
  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

<DESC>This is an annual synopsis of Repair Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00383-09-G-001D with BAE Systems Information and Electronic Systems Integration, Greenlawn, NY and serves as the pre-solicitation synopsis notice for all repair orders issued by the NAVSUP WSS for the period of 16 October 2012 through 16 October 2013 for the evaluation and repair of various repair components of the Navy Weapons System manufactured and repair.

However, individual orders may be issued for any sole source item of repair under this Navy Weapons System.  A complete list of potential reparable items for which orders may be placed under this NAVSUP WSS BOA can be obtained upon request from the below cited point of contact.
 

Orders issued under the Basic Ordering Agreement and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the Naval Inventory Control Point (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.
 This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 

https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
 Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

Also critical outcomes will be strengthening citizen participation in local government decision-making, and new public-private partnerships for service delivery. Overall, the project will help foster stability, democratic practices, and economic development in Tajikistan by increasing the capacity and accountability of sub-national governments.</span></p>

<AWARDEE>California Rural Indian Health Board
<DESC><p>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>Expertise Related to Use and Analysis of Indian Data</p>
<p><br />1. Requesting Agency: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE)</p>
<p>Action Requested: ASPE is submitting an iProcurement Requisition, a description of work to be performed including a cost estimate to the Program Support Center (PSC) for a small professional services contract to obtain expertise to assist ASPE in developing and analyzing Medicaid provider payment data regarding IHS and tribal health facilities. We request that a professional services contract be awarded as a sole-source award to the California Rural Indian Health Board (CRIHB).</p>
<p>2. Contact information for CRIHB:</p>
<p>James Crouch, MPH<br />Executive Director, California Rural Indian Health Board<br />4400 Auburn Blvd., 2nd Floor<br />Sacramento, CA 95841<br /><br />3. Summary Description: This contract will provide the government with expert advice and technical assistance on the use of data regarding IHS and tribal facilities within the Medicaid State Information System (MSIS), analyses of data tables extracted from that system, and a written report and briefings for HHS and tribal audiences. We anticipate that CMS and IHS, through discussions with the CMS Tribal Technical Advisory Group, would use the results of this project to develop strategies to assist IHS and tribal health programs to increase their Medicaid collections to help these programs better address persistent health disparities within otherwise tight budget circumstances.</p>
<p>4. Specific Description of Work Required of the Contractor (CRIHB): <br />(1) provide input and advice to ASPE and another contractor, under a separate contract, regarding the most useful levels of detail, aggregations and sub-totals for the data tables this other contractor will produce by extracting data from MSIS, as well as appropriate caveats for using and interpreting the data; (2) provide information to ASPE and the other contractor that defines the geographic boundaries of the 12 IHS Areas, so that the other contractor can produce data tables by IHS Area as well as by State; (3) analyze the series of very detailed data tables produced by the other contractor for trends over time and by provider and service types and demographic variables to identify similarities and differences and their potential implications for the future for IHS and tribal Medicaid collections under current Medicaid rules and under the FY 2014 Medicaid eligibility expansion; (4) produce a narrative report with simplified data tables; and (5) develop and present briefings to HHS and tribal audiences.</p>
<p><br />5. Justification: CRIHB, a tribal organization, under the leadership of Mr. James Crouch, its Executive Director, and with his associate, Dr. Carol Korenbrot, Ph.D., a bio-statistician formerly with the University of California, San Francisco, has extensive experience and a unique level of specific expertise in identifying and examining the completeness and accuracy of health care and other data related to American Indians and Alaska Natives and the specialized Indian health and general health care providers who serve them. Mr. Crouch and Dr. Korenbrot have unmatched breadth and depth of knowledge on Indian data in specialized and generalized data sets, including its limitations and other special considerations in how to use it appropriately, and a well-known reputation for interpreting the data objectively. Their work has included in-depth analyses of both claims data and survey data, conducting in-depth analyses of such data for policy purposes. They both have extensive experience in preparing reports and conducting briefings to communicate their findings and policy impacts and options to CMS, IHS, ASPE, and tribal audiences. Since 2007, they have produced a series of national reports for CMS on Indian Medicaid, Medicare, and related data and their implications which are widely recognized as the authoritative sources on these subjects. They also coordinated a national Indian Data Symposium on these subjects. While this contract is not a follow-on project in the strict sense, since it would be issued by ASPE (not CMS), it is a logical next step in this overall body of work, and serves very similar purposes in informing HHS and tribal policy discussions and decisions.</p>
<p>6. Recommendation: ASPE recommends that an "Other than Full and Open Competition" process be used to accomplish the Department's immediate tasks described here.</p>

<DESC>The quantity was reduced from 206 Desktops to 158 Desktops. Because there was simply not enough to offer every vendor the opportunity to send an updated quote, we adjusted the overall pricing of every submitted quote to reflect the new quantity. The cost of each line item remained the same the only change was in total price due to a lower quantity.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs
                                       Office of Acquisition Operations
                                       Technology Acquisition Center
                                       1701 Directors Blvd, Suite 600
                                       Austin, TX  78744

2.	Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a firm-fixed price task order under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for "Enterprise Output Solution" (EOS) Thin Client software maintenance and support, onsite software training, and implementation and system testing for the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC).  The planned period of performance consists of a seven (7) month base period with three (3) one-year option periods, plus a six (6) month option to extend services, should it be needed. 

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  The proposed action is to provide EOS Thin Client software maintenance and support, onsite software training, and implementation and system testing.  Specifically, the EOS Thin Client software maintenance will include downloads, upgrades, troubleshooting and technical support in order to provide the AITC with dynamic filtering, extensive conversion of report formats and enhanced data mining functionality.  The contractor shall ensure that the system is end-user friendly, as well as consistent and supportive of the architecture defined for the AITC.  AITC requires a certified and accredited single reporting tool to support several VA mainframe applications with online report storage, indexing, archive, retrieval, management, and secure presentment.  The VA programs which will use this System to process data for services include human resources, payroll, financial, and medical.  Data contained in these programs include financial data, Privacy Act data, Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) data.  All information is processed and stored at the AITC on a predominantly mainframe system using mainframe and web front end accessibility with desktop access only from within the VA firewalls.  The Contractor shall also conduct onsite software training, implementation and system testing of the EOS application to include software testing on the user system, system administrator testing, and user business process training. The total estimated price of the proposed action is $704,090.72, consisting of $183,065.09 for the base period, $164,343.17 for the first 12-month option period, $149,777.18 for the second 12-month option period, and $149,777.18 for the third and final 12-month option period, and $57,128.10 for the optional six-month extension of services period, should it be required.

4.	Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 253J(b) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled "Exceptions to the fair opportunity process," only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized.

5.	Use of Authority Cited:  The proposed source for this action is Immix Technology (Immix), 8444 Westpark Drive, Suite 200, McLean, VA, 22102, a prime contractor on the NASA SEWP IV GWAC.  The AITC uses EOS Thin Client brand name software which is proprietary to Rogers Software Development, Inc. (RSD), and who refuses to sell the proprietary code information to any other company other than Immix.  RSD's EOS software facilitates financial report viewing via secure web browser by each user and is already installed and in service.  The use of the EOS brand is essential to the Government's requirement because of the need for compatibility with existing software and uninterrupted performance.  This precludes consideration of a different product for maintenance, training, implementation, and testing services.  The EOS Thin Client software maintenance, training, implementation, and testing can only be procured from the software manufacturer or an authorized reseller.  The existing perpetual software licenses require upgrades and maintenance support to make sure that the EOS Thin Client environment within the VA IT infrastructure runs optimally, minimizing disruptions to users, downtime and/or loss of data provided by EOS Thin Client software.  Only Immix has the expertise to train users, implement, and test the software.  Use of other contractors will negatively impact service to Veterans due to their lack of expertise.  Additionally, RSD owns the proprietary rights to the source code and its only reseller for these services is Immix, therefore only Immix has the rights to provide all of the services for the aforementioned commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software.  For example, only Immix can provide feature software code-based changes to its software, which gives them the ability to provide customized implementation and support guidance for EOS Thin Client implementations within VA.  RSD has partnered with Immix, signing a partner agreement with Immix in order to market the RSD products on the Immix NASA SEWP IV GWAC.  

Due to VA's large complex EOS Thin Client environment, customized training is required.  Only Immix can provide access to the key resources required.  The customized training is required for VA employees to maintain and improve VA's EOS Thin Client environment consistent with their specific VA IT job roles and competencies.  Generic, off-the-shelf training courses would unnecessarily expose VA employees/students to materials not germane to their jobs. 

Implementation and testing of the customized EOS Thin Client reports is vital to make certain that the software is operating as it is supposed to operate.  Immix and RSD personnel have an intimate working knowledge of the customized reports and this knowledge excludes implementation and testing of the reports by any other company as a substitute for Immix and RSD.  Therefore, no other software maintenance, onsite training, and implementation and testing will work with the EOS Thin Client software, and these services can only be acquired from Immix.  

6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  This Justification and Approval and the Request for Quote (RFQ) will be submitted to all four (4) NASA SEWP IV GWAC groups in order to fully notify all interested parties.  Any proposals received will be evaluated.  Furthermore, in accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(D)(1)(i), this action will be synopsized at award on the Federal Business Opportunity Page (FBO) and the justification will be made publicly available on FedBizOpps.gov within 14 days after award in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D)(1).

7.	Actions to Increase Competition:  In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the agency will work with the program office to perform additional market research so that other solutions can be considered.

8.	Market Research:  In October 2011, a technical review of similar maintenance services and support from Snapshot Technologies, whose SnapWeb software is currently in use but is to be replaced by EOS Thin Client, was conducted by the Government's technical experts, and a determination was made that those services cannot meet the Government's requirements as stipulated in paragraph five (5).  SnapWeb is a non-scalable service.  It is not ubiquitous within the industry, and the vendor has no regular program to upgrade the application to stay current with technology.  User interfaces are not intuitive, and there is little opportunity for customization.  Furthermore, additional market request conducted by TAC-Austin in December 2011 on NASA SEWP IV GWAC, by using the Manufacturer Lookup and Product Verification tool, confirmed Immix was the sole authorized reseller of these EOS Thin Client services.  The contract specialist also conducted independent market research and found the following:  

a.	Searched GSA/FSS (GSA Advantage) - 
No contractors were found.
b.	Searched VIP Database, at http://www.VetBiz.gov - 
Immix is neither a SDVOSB nor a VOSB
c.	Searched CCR - 
Immix is listed as a small business for NAICS 443120, but as a large business for NAICS 511210, the code that is being used for this acquisition.

9.	Other Facts:  A previous contract task order was awarded in August of 2010, using the NASA SEWP IV GWAC Number NNG07DA20B, Order Number VA798A-10-0470, to Immix.  Only Immix submitted a quote as an authorized reseller for RSD's EOS software and maintenance services.




 
10.	Technical and Requirements Certification:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

11.	Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination:  I hereby determine that the anticipated price to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable based on the fact that contracts awarded on NASA SEWP IV GWAC have already been determined to be fair and reasonable.  The successful quote will be compared to the Independent Government Cost Estimate.

Approval

In my role as the Contracting Activity Competition Advocate, and based on the foregoing justification, I hereby approve a Firm Fixed Price task order under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV Government Wide Acquisition Contract for Enterprise Output Solution Thin Client software maintenance and support, onsite software training, and implementation and system testing for the Austin Information Technology Center.  This action will be issued as an exception to fair opportunity pursuant to FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), subject to availability of funds, and provided that the services herein described have otherwise been authorized for acquisition.

<p>This contract will assist ICE in meeting its need to provide special agents within HSI who are assigned to Special Response Teams with a specific riflescope which will be utilized as part of the newly created Tactical Observer Program.

<p>Rational of Circumstances that deems only one brand name reasonably available: <br />ICE has issued and tested the Premier Reticles Heritage 3-15x50mm Light Tactical Gen 2-MD Reticle, 0.1mrad, 12mil-CCW, Illuminated Model Riflescope, Manufacturer Product #PRH-11013 extensively as part of the creation of the HSI SRT Tactical Observer Program. The National Firearms and Tactical Training Unit (NFTTU) Armory Operations Branch have built prototype precision rifles which have been field tested for durability and accuracy. This item was installed as a part of the custom precision rifle package. It has been determined that this brand name product meets and/or exceeds the needs of the Tactical Observer Program as per the guidelines established by the NFTTU. Prior to the full implementation of the Tactical Observer Program, the Armory Operations Branch must custom build the remaining precision rifles which are to be issued to select SRT members who will be assigned and subsequently trained as Tactical Observers. The precision rifles being built must conform to the exacting standards that are set by the Armory Branch and therefore, must be assembled using the exact parts as the prototypes ensuring consistency amongst the program while maintaining the strictest standards for accuracy, reliability, and durability.</p>

<DESC>This action is a continuation of software sustainment and development to the DISA Gateway Evolution and Sustainment Branch (NS113) for the Enterprise Management with Enhanced Resource Allocation Database System (EMERALDS). The EMERALDS is a protected, web-based management tool which supports the delivery and administration of high-capacity communication networks for DoD Satellite Communications (SATCOM) facility site assets. It is a centralized management tool that provides equipment and DISN Services inventories, planning management, mission projection, reporting, and trend analysis capabilities. EMERALDS supports all tactical communications in response to wartime, humanitarian and training missions to prepare the Armed Forces communication units for deployment. When fully implemented, EMERALDS will interface with the DISN Operational Support Systems (OSS), Joint Integrated SATCOM Tool (JIST) and other SATCOM management tools.
<p>The contractor shall provide NS113 with the requisite management, integration, and technical support for the sustainment and development of EMERALDS to meet the warfighter's requirement. Specific contractor support includes, but is not limited to, continued development and deployment of existing EMERALDS tools and capabilities, technical support; hardware and software installation and integration; database and software development; continued updating and employment of key SATCOM management and planning data; data manipulation and presentation; testing, demonstration, and fielding of developed software systems; and requisite hardware and software sustainment and support activities.</p>

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  

Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC), Office of Information and Analytics Division 
6150 Oak Tree Blvd. Ste. 300
Independence, OH 44131

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  

This action is for a new procurement of a Veterans Affairs (VA) enterprise wide license for electronic access to the Elsevier Collection Subscription:  Clinical Key from Elsevier, Inc.  No substitutions for alternate titles will meet VA's requirements, as much of the content on Elsevier is proprietary to Elsevier, and not offered through a third party product.  Procurement of access to Clinical Key will be accomplished through the establishment of a new standalone firm fixed price contract following the procedures in FAR Part 12 and 15.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) medical center libraries, Central Office staff, and the staff at the all VA Medical Centers (VAMCs), Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), and other affiliated programs and offices require continued access to the web-based version of the Elsevier Collection Clinical Key Subscription 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The Elsevier Clinical Key Subscription Collection titles have often been cited by newspapers such as the Washington Post as several of the world's premier medical journals, ebooks, and other knowledge based information.  Elsevier an established commercial product, and  is used heavily by VA librarians, clinicians, researchers, and educators.  

The performance of performance (POP) is from September 30, 2012 to September 29, 2013.











4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

The web-based version of the Elsevier Clinical Key Collection Subscription provides unique access to over 800 books, 500 journals, and 9,000 medical and surgical videos.  The VA Office of Information and Analytics (OIA) has identified 531 ( see Attachment 1) book and journal titles offered by Elsevier that are of specific interest to VA, and all of these titles are proprietary to Elsevier.  Elsevier is also the sole distributor of their online product, making them the only source available to provide a subscription to their service.  

Elsevier also meets VA's needs by providing enterprise-wide access to their content with no geographic or concurrent user limitations, content in both HTML and PDF formats, access to online only supplements and images, and detailed usage reports.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

A Sources Sought Notice was published to FedBizOpps on June 7th, 2012 and expired on June 14th, 2012 at 12:00pm, and no responses were received.  Market research has also revealed that Elsevier is the only distributor of their database.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

The contracting officer will perform the required price analysis using the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) as a pricing benchmark to ensure that any proposed price will be fair and reasonable, and will use other ongoing and historical development efforts as points of comparison.  





8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:

A Sources Sought Notice was published to FedBizOpps, and one (1) response was received; the one (1) respondent was Elsevier Medical Solutions:  Health Sciences Division.  Elsevier was also contacted for market research purposes, and it was determined that they are the only source that distributes their software.  Further, contacting Elsevier revealed that much of their content is proprietary, and they do not distribute the vast majority of their content to third party distributors.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

None

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition

HDI 12-66 LWW Total Access Collection Subscription


1.	Contracting Activity:  

Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC)
6150 Oak Tree Blvd. Ste. 300
Independence, OH 44131

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed 

This procurement action is for the purchase of a VA enterprise wide license for electronic access to the name brand product Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (LWW) Total Access Collection Subscription.  No substitutions for alternate titles are acceptable.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  

a.	Veterans Health Administration (VHA) medical center libraries, Central Office staff, and the staff at the all VA Medical Centers (VAMCs), Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), and other affiliated programs and offices continue to require continued access to the web-based version of the LWW Total Access Collection Subscription  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
b.	The LWW titles, often cited as several of the world's premier medical journals by newspapers such as the Washington Post, are used heavily by VA librarians, clinicians, researchers, and educators.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	(X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;


5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

It is essential for VA to obtain access to vetted, peer reviewed, and authoritative sources of information for its clinicians for use in direct patient care, obtaining additional knowledge necessary to maintain accreditation, and to conduct research.  The LWW Total Access Collection meets all of the aforementioned requirements, and is widely recognized as an essential resource for healthcare professionals.   LWW is rated as one of the top five publishers in the health sciences field, is highly ranked by the Doody's Review Service, and is also well rated by the 2011 Medical Library Association's Master Guide to Authoritative Information Resources in the Health Sciences.  The medical research functionality offered by LWW is comparable to the legal information research tools LexisNexis and Westlaw.

All of the publications offered by LWW are proprietary, and LWW offers unique functionality by providing:  

"	Unlimited enterprise-wide access with no geographic or concurrent user limitations
"	Content in both HTML and PDF formats
"	Access to online-only supplements and images
"	Detailed usage reports

There are other resources on the commercial market similar in scope to LWW, such as ProQuest or Elsevier's Clinical Key, but the VA Library is also looking to procure those products, and others, in order to provide a well rounded library of medical information resources for VA Clinicians.  LWW has been determined to be an essential part of the VA's medical information resource offerings, and is why the name brand requirement is justified under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.


6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

Sources Sought Notices were published from 08/28/2012 to 09/04/2012 to both FedBizOpps (FBO) and eBuy, and revealed that (3) total vendors are interested in submitting offers for the potential procurement of a LWW Total Access Subscription.  Two (2) of the respondents hold BOA's through the VACO VALNET Program, and one (1) offeror holds an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract through the FedLink Program.   
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

<Procurement Sensitive information has been omitted from this FedBizOpps (FBO) posting>

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

Sources sought notices were posted to both FBO and eBuy to locate sources for the required subscription to the LWW Total Access Collection, and past procurement history was analyzed.  

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

None




10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  

1)	Ovid Technologies, Inc.
2)	EBSCO Industries, Inc.
3)	W.T. Cox Subscriptions, Inc. 

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  

In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the agency will work with the program office to perform additional market research in a timely manner so that other solutions can be considered.

FOR EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
                                         	Office of Acquisition Operations
     	Technology Acquisition Center
     	260 Industrial Way West
     	Eatontown, NJ 07724
      
2.  Description of Action: The proposed sole source action is for a one year firm-fixed price (FFP) Delivery Order issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Government-wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for maintenance, technical support, enhancements, and regulatory updates of the Accu-Care Clinical Software version 6.3, which provides a Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) of nursing home patients.  

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:   The proposed action is to provide maintenance, technical support, enhancements and regulatory updates of the Accu-Care Clinical Software version 6.3.  The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1987 required the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to designate a Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) of nursing home patients that includes a Minimum Data Set (MDS).  CMS published final regulations requiring facilities to encode and transmit MDS data to the State on December 23, 1997. 

 In May 1995, VHA Under Secretary for Health approved VHA's Long Term Care Policy Plan, Information Letter (IL 10-95-024), and tasked the Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care with national VA implementation and automation of the RAI/MDS, VA's response to the legislation which included the mandate for a standardized assessment of each nursing home patient.  In 1999, VA procured a commercial RAI/MDS patient assessment instrument, Accu-Care, utilizing the Procurement of Computer Hardware and Software (PCHS) contract vehicle.  Accu-Care is still the RAI/MDS assessment tool used within VA and has progressed through a number of updates, the current version used being Accu-Care Version 6.3.  All data entered in the assessment is transmitted to the Austin Information Technology Center.  From that information, data performance measures for the Community Living Centers (CLCs), cost, and quality reports are developed by the Decision Support Service (DSS).  The Spinal Cord Injury and Diseases (SCI/D) Department uses the data to determine the acuity for all spinal cord residents in the CLC.  Additionally, the Allocation Resource Center (ARC) uses the data to quantify the appropriate fiscal allocations that should be sent to the 23 VISNs each year based in part on CLC workload.  Finally, the interdisciplinary staffs use the information to form individualized treatment plans that are then used to provide guidelines for providing care to all residents in the 134 CLCs.  

The contractor will provide 24 hour technical support via the company's toll free number.  The contractor will also provide all regulatory updates as well as a method for requesting VA specific enhancements.  
                     
4.  Statutory Authority: The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B) entitled, "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized".

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  VA has utilized the Accu-Care software for over a decade, and it is the system which is utilized VA-wide to meet the requirement for a RAI/MDS.  Although VA is currently developing a requirement for a competitive procurement of a new RAI/MDS tool, the contract for the new system will not be awarded before the expiration of the current maintenance contract necessary for the Accu-Care licenses to be valid.  In order to meet the requirement for  RAI/MDS while the competitive effort is finalized, the current Accu-Care maintenance must be renewed so that the software can be utilized until the follow-on competitive effort is awarded.  The maintenance requires knowledge of Accu-Care's proprietary software specifications and therefore VA's requirement for Accu-Care maintenance can only be met with Accu-Care's proprietary maintenance contract available through authorized resellers of Accu-Care's products.  The current maintenance contract expires on Sept. 30, 2012, at which time the perpetual software licenses will not be valid, leading to a loss of the RAI/MDS tool for the CLCs which will not allow them to meet the Congressional Mandate for all CLC's to have a RAI/MDS software suite.  Without this software the CLCs would no longer have a standardized assessment, VHA would lose its ability to compare its nursing home data with non-federal nursing homes, and VA Central Office (VACO) would lose valuable data which is instrumental in the development of performance measures.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet VA's requirements.  Furthermore, in accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2), this action will be synopsized at time of award on the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO) and the justification will be made publicly available.  

 7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  This action is necessary to ensure VA retains maintenance coverage, required for the current Accu-Care software licenses to remain valid, while VA develops a competitive solicitation for a new RAI/MDS tool to be awarded in Fiscal Year 13.    

8.  Market Research:   Market research was conducted between September 2011 and June 2012 by the Government's subject matter expert by reviewing similar software maintenance products, specifically PointClickCare, Lintech, ADL Data Systems, HealthMEDX, Senior Care Software, Hi-Tech Software Solutions, and American HealthTech.  Based on reviews of these products, the Government's technical experts determined that no other maintenance service can maintain the Accu-Care software suites, due to the proprietary technical data necessary for maintenance of the system.  Additionally, in August 2012, the OEM, Accu-Med, was consulted and verified that it does not have any authorized resellers of its software.  However, Accu-Med has partnered with Immix Technology through the NASA SEWP vehicle to be the sole Government provider of Accu-Care software suites.
