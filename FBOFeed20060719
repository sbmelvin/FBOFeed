<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation is seeking potential sources for an Outdoor Audible Warning System (Siren System) to notify nearby residents in case of a flood event.  The desired action is to obtain a complete, installed, remotely-activated system that will provide an audible warning (siren) and bilingual {English/Spanish] voice instructions for nearby residents.  Interested sources will be required to submit a proposal that includes all components needed to meet the intent of warning the public in an area defined by Reclamation.  A partial list of the needed components includes: the controls and equipment that operates the siren (siren activation system), siren speaker banks, the pole to mount the siren speaker banks, the AC power cable buried in conduit from the building to the sirens (or aerial from a nearby power pole), all electrical work needed to wire the siren into the existing electrical service, and installation of all the components. The siren activation point shall be a stand-alone unit that does NOT require the use of a PC computer.  The proposal must be for a complete, functional remote-controlled siren system including all hardware and software installation, and training of local staff on the use of the hardware software.  All sound equipment must be designed using Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) CPG -1-17 Guidelines, with all coverage calculations provided as part of an interested sources quotation.  Modifications to a proposal, after contract award, to include miscellaneous items needed to have a complete and functional system shall not be allowed, unless a change is requested by Reclamation.  Interested sources must be prepared to provide a siren that can be controlled from a central location at the siren site, and have the capability of multiple unique siren sounds to be used for floods, fires, and other hazards.  The siren activation and monitoring point shall control the siren via buried land line cable.  All land line cable shall be buried in conduit at a minimum depth of 18 inches unless directed otherwise.  If radio telemetry is used, the radios shall meet all applicable Federal Government Radio (NTIA) Narrow Banding requirements.  The radio communication system shall be secure and have redundant paths to the site, and shall have the ability to transmit various siren commands.   A unique radio frequency is not available for this system; therefore, the radio system should either be able to "piggy-back" on an existing frequency without any interference, or be a spread-spectrum or other type of radio system that doesn't require a site license. Interested sources are encouraged to submit a response, not later than 07/25/2006, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the requirements stated above, and include the firm's DUNS and TIN.  This is a Sources Sought Notice only and not a Request for Quotation/Proposal or an announcement of a solicitation.  The Government will not pay for any materials furnished in response to this synopsis.  Submittals furnished will not be returned to the sender.  Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 561620, which is $10.5 Million.  The information gathered from this notice will be used to determine which preference program will be used to process the acquisition [e.g., 8(a) set-aside under the Small Business Administration's 8(a) program, total small business set-aside, or full and open competition].  No preference program determination will be made until the market research has been completed.  Inquiries and responses will only be accepted by Fax at 303/445-6345, Attention: John Collins or e-mail at jcollins@do.usbr.gov.

<DESC>OVERVIEW: This combine synopsis and solicitation for commercial items in support of the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) has been prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12. This announcement constitutes the ONLY solicitation; no other solicitation will be issued. CSOSA is an independent, executive branch Federal Agency, established under Section 11232 of the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997. CSOSA is seeking sources with proposals that have a robust research design with clearly defined public safety and justice performance measures.  Additionally, these proposals shall address cost-benefit issues and represent a strong collaborative relationship with CSOSAs Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE) and Community Justice Programs (CJP).
DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: Your proposals shall include a robust research design with clearly defined public safety and justice indicators/performance measures.  Additionally, the proposal shall address cost-benefit issues and represent a strong collaborative relationship with CSOSAs Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE) and Community Supervision Services (CSS). CSOSA seeks proposals with robust designs to include cross-sectional, time-series, multi-cohort, or other appropriate approaches necessary to assess the alignment of the agencys operational definition of close monitoring, policies and procedures regulating the implementation of such activities, and the actual implementation of activities in the field.  We are particularly interested in proposals that include detailed descriptions of outputs associated with close-monitoring activities (e.g., referrals to program interventions, office/field contacts, implementation of graduated sanctions, home/employment verifications, accountability tours, etc.) as well as officers perceptions about the nature and scope of interactions with offenders (e.g., frequency, duration, and quality of interaction, ability to appropriately screen and assess offenders needs, and the level of responsibilities assigned to support reintegration).  To better understand the implementation of close monitoring practices and the variety thereof, CSOSA encourages methodological consideration be given to randomized field observations. For purposes of this project, CSOSA defines its close monitoring activities in terms of the totality of community supervision services conducted on behalf of the offender, residents of the District of Columbia, the releasing authorities, victims of crime, and other community stakeholders groups.  We limit the observation of close monitoring to activities conducted by CSOSA employees.  CSOSA requires proposals to address close monitoring within the context of the Agencys caseload strategy (to include the geographic alignment of resources).  [NOTE:  CSOSA has more than 30 supervision teams comprised of 6 to 8 community supervision officers.  Caseloads per officer range from 25:1 to 35:1 in specialized units and roughly 50:1 in general supervision.  Offenders are supervised at either a minimum, medium, maximum, or intensive level and classified with a status of active, inactive, monitored, or warrant.] The agency business hours are 7:00AM till 6:00PM, Monday through Friday, except Federal Holidays. The Government observes the following Federal Holidays as non-work days: 1. New Year Day, 2. Martin Luther King Birthday, 3. Washington Birthday, 4. Memorial Day, 5. Independence Day, 6. Labor Day, 7. Columbus Day, 8. Veterans Day, 9. Thanksgiving Day, 10. Christmas Day, 11. Inauguration Day (every fourth year). The Government business hours may also change at the discretion and mutual agreement between the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR). PROPOSALS:  Interested firms shall submit a WRITTEN and PRICE proposal to qualify for award of this requirement. CSOSA requires proposals to distinguish between prioritization categories and referral type (when appropriate). Your proposal must state the problem under investigation (including goals and objectives of the proposed project) and the relevance of the project to public safety and justice in Washington, D.C. and surrounding jurisdictions.  You must also state the research question and objectives with clearly defined statement of the relevance to community supervision in Washington, D.C.  Proposals shall describe in sufficient detail the relevance of research questions and the appropriateness of the methods and analytical approach (es). The WRITTEN proposal shall constitute an abstract (not to exceed 400 words); Program Narrative (not to exceed 20 pages  double space 12pt font); Research question or problem; Research goals and objectives; Research design and methods; Implications for operations improvement and policy development; Dissemination plan for project deliverables; Description of costs; Staffing plan; and Timeline (to include milestones and deliverables). Note:  All tables, figures, and chart should be placed in appendices. CSOSA encourages collaboration with culturally competent researchers or practitioners who have a demonstrated track record implementing evaluation projects focused on the challenges of underserved, ethnic minority, and criminal justice populations.  Letters of support should be included in an appendix. Federal regulations require that procedures be outlined for protecting private information about individuals.  Upon receipt of the proposals, the Government will schedule oral presentations. The evaluation will be conducted by a peer-review panel. The panelists will consider both technical and programmatic merits. These panelists will be selected based on their expertise in subject areas pertinent to the proposals. Upon final evaluation, the Government will determine those individuals considered to be in the competitive range. All individuals will be notified in writing of their standing as it relates to this requirement. All offerors must have demonstrated Quality and technical merit to include (1) Awareness of the state of current research or technology (2) Soundness of methodology and analytic and technical approach (3) Feasibility of proposed project and awareness pitfalls and (4) Innovation and creativity (when appropriate); Impact of the proposed project  to include (1) Relevance for improving the policy and practice of community supervision in Washington, D.C. to include improvements to public safety, security, and quality of life, (2) Feasibility and cost-benefit assessment of proposed strategies and/or recommendations and (3) Potential for significant advances in the field; Capabilities, demonstrated productivity, and experience of applicants that include (1) Qualifications and experience of proposed staff, (2) Ethnic/cultural diversity of proposed staff, (3) Demonstrated ability of proposed staff and organization to manage the effort; (4) Adequacy of the plan to manage the project, including how various tasks are subdivided with clearly defined metrics for monitoring timing of milestones and deliverables and (5) Demonstrated a track record conducting evaluation projects within federal agencies with direct operations responsibilities; a Budget that reflects (1) Total cost of the project; (2) Appropriateness of the budget relative to the level of effort and (3) Use of existing resources to conserve costs (to utilization of internal research and evaluation staff). Dissemination strategy that has a well-defined plan for the offeror  to share results with appropriate audiences, including researchers, practitioners, and policymakers and suggestions for print and electronic products CSOSA might develop for practitioners and policymakers. In addition CSOSA is requiring contractors to establish an independent review team to review project plans and evaluation methodology. This requirement should be reflective in your proposal submission as a separate line item cost. Once the competitive range has been determined, it is envisioned a single or multiple awards will be issued. Upon issuance of an award, the Government will release the first task to support this requirement for submission of a proposal. All unescorted Contractor personnel utilized under this award submit to a Government background investigation prior to performing work on-site at any CSOSA facility. The intent and purpose of this investigation is to preclude the assignment of any individual who poses a threat to the Government or successful work completion due to a past unlawful or inappropriate behavior. Contractor employees must be U.S. citizens, or be lawfully permitted to reside in the United States and possess a valid work permit.  Background investigations: The Contractor shall ensure that a Contractor employee does not begin work until the appropriate background checks are conducted and approved by the CSOSA Office of Security.  When a preliminary background check on an individual has been determined to be favorable, the Office of Security will issue an interim employment security approval to the Office of Procurement, who in turn will notify the Contractor.  Only at that time may the Contractor notify an individual to begin work at a CSOSA facility. Derogatory information, falsification of any forms or refuses to supply information and/or forms may be considered justification to reject the individual. When an individual is selected for contractual employment, the Contractor shall have the individual complete a background investigation package consisting of the items identified below.  The individual is generally provided 10 days to complete and return the forms to the Contracting Officer, or authorized representative. The following forms will be provided and must be completed: (1) CSOSA-SEC-0008, Agency Credit Release form, (2) FD 258, FBI Fingerprint Card, (3) Standard Form 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, (4) Contractor Preliminary Background Check Form. It is the responsibility of the Contractor, in order to ensure complete coverage for the services specified herein, to maintain an adequate staff of individuals meeting all of the requirements of this contract. To that end, the Contractor should submit the names of additional individuals, so that the requisite preliminary background checks can be conducted. CSOSA has the right to request any additional information necessary in order to adjudicate the completed background investigation.  If a Contractor employee fails to provide any of the above information, or to cooperate with CSOSA Office of Security, the individual will be removed immediately.  Contractor Responsibility: (1) The Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor employee commences performance prior to completion of the background investigation, unless the Office of Security grants approval. (2) Any individual who has been temporarily removed or resigned may be required to undergo another background investigation before resuming any position. At the discretion of the COTR, the Contractor shall forward the required forms for a reinvestigation to the COTR. Prior to forwarding the forms, the Contractor is responsible reviewing the forms for completeness.  The forms should be forwarded with a cover letter indicating that the forms are for reinvestigation of a current Contractor employee. Government Responsibility: (1) The Government will conduct a background investigation on all individuals involved in the contract. Derogatory information developed from this investigation may be considered justification to reject the applicant.  The Government also reserves the right to reinvestigate all Contractor personnel working on this contract for any reason. (2) Upon completion of the background investigation, the Office of Security will review the results to determine suitability for the individual. Primary concern in the review process is to decide if the individual(s) presence in Agency facilities poses a potential risk of CSOSA, the Government, or the general public.  The following Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Provisions, applicable to this combined synopsis and solicitation, are incorporated, in full, by reference: FAR 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors and FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representation and Certifications.

<DESC>OVERVIEW: This combine synopsis and solicitation for commercial items in support of the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA) has been prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12. This announcement constitutes the ONLY solicitation; no other solicitation will be issued. CSOSA is an independent, executive branch Federal Agency, established under Section 11232 of the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997. CSOSA is seeking sources with proposals that have a robust research design with clearly defined public safety and justice performance measures.  Additionally, these proposals shall address cost-benefit issues and represent a strong collaborative relationship with CSOSAs Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE) and Community Justice Programs (CJP).
DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: 	Your proposals shall include a robust research design with clearly defined public safety and justice indicators/performance measures.  Additionally, these proposals shall address cost-benefit issues and represent a strong collaborative relationship with CSOSAs Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE), Community Supervision Services (CSS), and Community Justice Programs (CJP).
CSOSA seeks proposals with statistical techniques that will inform risk classification of offenders and the construction of offender typologies.  CSOSA has been designing and refining its screening tool (the Auto Screener) with a focus on validation and re-validation of the underlying logic and algorithms.  Specifically, CSOSA has developed an initial model that identifies the probability that an offender will be arrested within six months of supervision intake.  Because the underlying logic/algorithm were developed under a legacy tool and transported to the Auto Screener, CSOSA is seeking to establish a new set of logic/algorithms appropriated designed for the Auto Screener.  The objective is to re-compute models of supervision failure (e.g., rearrest, revocation, warrant issuance, etc.) for new intake and stock population groups as well as develop an initial offender typology.  These models are to be developed in collaboration with CSOSAs Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE) and other internal stakeholders.The modeling process shall undergo an initial validation and performance review (6 months from Auto Screener roll-out [March 2006]) and a revalidation and performance review using Auto Screeners administered between October 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006.  Each validation and review shall assess model performance in terms of classification for new intake cases and stock population separately.  The same shall hold true for classification of offender types  along criminality and/or service delivery needs. For the purpose of this requirement, CSOSA defines the Auto Screener as a screening tool administered at offender intake (initial) and every 180 days thereafter (reassessment).  CSOSA supervises more than 15,000 offender a day with nearly 10,000 intakes yearly.  Offenders are supervised across 30 supervision teams comprised of 6 to 8 community supervision officers.  Caseloads per officer range from 25:1 to 35:1 in specialized units and roughly 50:1 in general supervision.  Offenders are supervised at either a minimum, medium, maximum, or intensive level (per legacy Screener and Auto Screener recommendations) and classified with a status of active, inactive, monitored, or warrant.  For purposes of this analysis, we exclude offenders adjudicated in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia being supervised outside of the jurisdiction under an Interstate Compact Agreement.

PROPOSALS:  Interested firms shall submit a WRITTEN and PRICE proposal to qualify for award of this requirement. CSOSA requires proposals to distinguish between prioritization categories and referral type (when appropriate).

<CONTACT>Curtis Fields, (202) 385-8649
<DESC>This Internet announcement is made pursuant to section 3.2.1.2.1 (Market Analysis) of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS).  The FAA intends to extend the Automated Radar Terminal System - Version IE (ARTS IE) contract, DTFA01-03-D-03006, with Lockheed Martin Corporation for a period of 2 years from September 30, 2006 through September 29, 2008.  The ARTS IE is a Stand-Alone Tower Display Systems (SATDS) contract that was awarded for $7,249,967 to acquire a maximum of 30 NAS-certified ARTS IEs.  Currently, the FAA has ordered 7 ARTS IEs; therefore, the contract price and maximum quantities will remain the same for the contract's 2-year extension. The SATDS is an interim solution that is intended for use in pre-existing Air Traffic Control Towers (ATCTs) not associated with a Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facility.  These ATCTs do not currently receive automation data from a TRACON.  These ATCTs generally have long range Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR) coverage as opposed to short range Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) coverage.  However, the SATDS must provide the capability to receive and display aircraft position data to the ATCT controller from ARSR, ASR, or both systems.  The SATDS, as an interim solution, is to be eventually replaced by FAA'S Terminal Automation Modernization and Replacement (TAMR) systems.  For the time frame under consideration for this extension, the ARTS IE systems will be getting flight plan information through Flight Data Input/Output from the FAA's En Route Automation system. Functional requirements for the SATDS include, but are not limited to the following:  Conflict Alert (CA) safety functions; Mode C Intruder (MCI) safety functions; Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) safety functions; primary and secondary radar(s) target identification; alphanumeric capabilities (data blocks, lists); and weather information services. In order to provide continued life cycle support for the ARTS IE software and a certified system that meets the requirements listed above, this offering is limited to vendors with existing, fielded, FAA-Certified, United States of America National Airspace System (NAS) real-time terminal air traffic control automation systems.  Vendors believing they possess the capability to meet this requirement should respond to this announcement with your firm's capabilities and experience in providing system(s) that meet the above requirements. The FAA will evaluate your response accordingly.  Responses may be submitted no later than July 31, 2006, to Curtis Fields via e-mail at curtis.fields@faa.gov.  They may also be provided via express mail to the following address: Federal Aviation Administration 600 Independence Ave. S.W., Room E541NN Washington, D.C. 20591 Attn: Curtis Fields ATO-A

<SUBJECT>D -- Modification of the Credit Risk Assessment Framework & Support for the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program
<SOLNBR>DTFR53-06-R-00005
<RESPDATE>081806

<DESC>BACKGROUND:  The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century established a new program of credit assistance, the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) Program.  Under this Program, loans and loan guarantees are available to acquire, improve or rehabilitate intermodal or rail equipment or facilities, including track, components of track, bridges, yards, buildings and shops, to refinance existing debt incurred for the previous purposes, and to develop or establish new intermodal or railroad facilities.  Eligible applicants include states, local governments, government sponsored authorities, and corporations, Amtrak and freight railroads.  There is a statutory maximum amount of outstanding unpaid principal at any point in time of $35 billion.  Of this, $7 billion is reserved for projects primarily benefiting shortline and regional railroads.  The Credit Reform Act of 1990 requires that funds be available to cover the subsidy cost before a direct loan or loan guarantee can be approved by any Federal agency under any program.   Generally, these costs are covered by appropriations from Congress.  However, unlike other federal credit programs, the RRIF programs enabling legislation provides that such subsidy cost can be paid from appropriations, a credit risk premium paid by the borrow (CRP) or any combination of the two.  Since the RRIF program has not had any appropriations, all the loans previously approved and all that will be approved in the foreseeable future have required, and will require, the payment of a CRP.  

The calculation of the CRP depends on many factors, including the financial condition of the applicant, the amount of collateral offered to secure the loan and the financial strength of the applicant.  In order to calculate the CRP for each loan application, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has previously developed, through a contractor, a Credit Risk Assessment Framework (CRAF).   The CRAF, which has been approved by OMB, relies on the latest default experience available for corporations in the private sector.  Thus, the CRAF must be updated on a yearly basis.  The CRAF is also used to comply with OMBs requirement to reestimate subsidy costs for each loan on a yearly basis.    The CRAF model has been used primarily to calculate the credit risk premium of corporate applicants from the private sector.

REQUIREMENT: The purpose of this acquisition is to procure services to maintain the CRAF and modify it as necessary, to assist FRA in generating yearly reestimates of subsidy costs for each outstanding loan in the portfolio, and to provide support for the FRAs RRIF Program in connection with the CRAF model.
The specific requirements are to (1) annually analyze the historical default experience of at least 1000 companies with credit ratings from nationally recognized statistical rating agencies;  apply various statistical methods, such as logistic regression analysis, to explain differences in the ratings of the 1,000 companies analyzed; update the CRAF based on the results of the analysis of the historical default analysis and FRAs own default experience for loans in the RRIF portfolio; and calculate reestimates of loans that have been made and provide supporting spreadsheets showing the calculations, and annual summary memorandum explaining the re-estimate methodology;  (2) assure that the CRAF is consistent with the Credit Subsidy Calculator required to be used by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), recommend procedures for calculating subsidy reestimates required by OMB and modify the CRAF to calculate the reestimates,  assure the error-free operation of the updated CRAF; modify the CRAF to run on new versions of Excel as needed,  revise the supporting documentation to explain the modifications and update the Users Guide to be consistent with the modifications and to incorporate the subsidy reestimates procedures, and  work with RRIF and FRA IT staff to resolve any CRAF technical issues and make any changes to the CRAF model as requested or as necessary; (3)  modify the CRAF to accommodate public sector applicants whose financial qualifications vary significantly from private corporations; explore the possibility of incorporating FRAs historical default experience into the CRAF default data base to more accurately reflect the default potential for RRIF applicants and provide a recommendation to the FRA, and explore the possibility of converting the CRAF model into a secure, Internet-based application enabling designated users to access the system using a browser, login ID and password and provide a recommendation to the FRA; and (4) Develop and provide training to the FRA on an as needed basis during the life of the contract.  The FRA anticipates that training may be required for up to 10 new and existing FRA staff when significant updates and enhancements are made to the CRAF.  Training shall be provided at the FRAs site in Washington, D.C.  

The successful offeror shall have a minimum of five (5) years experience in implementing requirements of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990.  This includes calculating subsidy estimates and reestimates in accordance with OMB requirements, including the current OMB Credit Subsidy Calculator.  

The FRA intends to award a 5-year firm-fixed-priced contract, consisting of a base year and four 1-year option periods.  This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 12.6  Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solication for Commercial Items, and FAR Part 5.203(a) and (b).  The FRA intends to post the solicitation for this requirement by July 21, 2006 on FedBizOps.

<SOLNBR>FA8728-06-R-0001
<RESPDATE>040606
<CONTACT>Cathy Mirra, Contract Specialist, cathy.mirra@hanscom.af.mil, (781) 377-5998 or Priscilla Busa, Contracting Officer, priscilla.busa@hanscom.af.mil, (781) 377-8673
<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA). This announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action for the proposed purchase of a Terrain Following Deployable Intrusion Detection Sensor for test and evaluation by the United States Air Force.  The acquisition is to include all tasks needed to procure production representative pieces of hardware, develop contractor test plans and procedures, perform an evaluation/test with results documented, prepare technical installation and operation input material, source control drawings to establish a configuration baseline and support a test at Eglin AFB (i.e., train initial test cadre and set-up sensor).   The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Senstar-Stellar Corporation (SSC), under authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The requirement is for an above ground line sensor that can be installed in less than 20 minutes per 50 meters by two personnel without specialized equipment. The installation area can vary in terrain and the sensor should be suitable where there is uneven terrain or vegetation that prevents effective use of line of sight microwave sensors, short distance breakwire or breakbeams. The sensor will also meet the Integrated Base Defense Security System (IBDSS) and Tactical Automated Security System (TASS) requirements for probability of detection, low invalid (combination of nuisance and false) alarm rate, and can be rapidly deployed. Specifically, this requires at a minimum, a probability of detecting an intruder of 0.90 at the 90% lower confidence limit.  This probability of detection is 0.95 for fixed site applications.  The sensor will also operate with a rate of two or less invalid alarms per sensor per twenty-four hours.  System shall operate in the range of temperatures between -40 to +70 degrees Celsius (-40 to +158 Fahrenheit). System shall operate satisfactorily in non-condensing relative humidity ranges up to 95% and condensing relative humidity up to 100%.  This deployable sensor shall meet performance requirements in sustained winds of up to 55.6 Km per hour (34.5 mph), without the aid of anchoring devices.  Equipment shall survive sustained winds up to 90 knots (103 mph) (mounting devices shall provide a means to be secured with sandbags, weights, stakes, etc., to withstand more severe environmental conditions, as practical).  Sensor shall operate in sustained rainfall of up to two (2) inches per hour, shall not be damaged by exposure to blowing dust or sand, shall be protected against the effects of lightning, surges and stray electrical charges, and shall withstand exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation without performance degradation for a period of 10 years.  The sensor is required to report alarms of an attempted tamper.  Sensor shall operate with a nominal 12 VDC supply and be operable with a Relocatable Battery Module (RBM) from the TASS equipment suite.  With an RBM, each sensor shall operate without AC power for at least 72 hours when operated at temperatures between 0 and 60 degrees Centigrade.  The RBM shall power the sensor for at least 48 hours when operating temperatures are between -30 and 0 degrees Centigrade. A further goal is for deployment of the sensor to be permitted without the need for radio frequency (RF) spectrum assignment/approval.  Additional goals for sensor set-up are for variable sensitivity, incorporation of a remotely activated self-test and alarms that provide indication of any equipment fault.  The unit cost objective is that a sensor will not exceed $7,500 for a 100 meter sensor segment.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government. This acquisition is to be accomplished under FAR Part 15 with an awarded value of less than $500,000. Any firms that believe they can meet the above requirements may identify their interest and capability to the Contract Specialist via email within 15 days of this notice. Responses shall be limited to ten pages. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Contact Ms. Cathy Mirra, Contract Specialist, at Cathy.Mirra@hanscom.af.mil or (781) 377-5998 with questions regarding this notice.  See Notes 22 and 26.

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation's most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability, and reduced energy consumption; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements including the P100 (Facility Standards for the  Public Buildings Service). As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals, including the new standards mandated by EPACT 2005, security requirements, and the Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards.  The facility will be designed in metric units. All projects will be LEED certified. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project is a new Federal Building in downtown Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  A design that uses a contextual strategy is a critical priority in this commission.  The preferred site for the building is a two-block area bounded by University Boulevard on the north, 20th Avenue on the east, 7th Street on the south, and 21st Avenue on the west.  This is a transitional area between the city's downtown to the west and residential development to the east.  In addition, the presence of the building along University Boulevard, the primary connector between the historic downtown and the classically-inspired University of Alabama campus, strongly suggests that the Federal Building serve as a visual bridge between two areas of Tuscaloosa's 19th century architectural heritage.  The architecture of the Federal Building should reflect its prominent location in this transitional setting, be sensitive to current master planning initiatives, and serve as a catalyst for future development.

SCOPE OF WORK
The delivery method for this project is design/build-bridging, and this solicitation is for the bridging architect.  As such, not all of the disciplines will be involved to the same extent in the production of the contract documents (drawings and specifications).  The government expects that the bridging architect will produce drawings that are approximately 35% complete, although some elements such as mechanical/electrical/plumbing may be less developed, while select tenant and public spaces may be further developed.

The facility will be designed using metric units of measurement.  The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architectural, landscape architectural/master planning, engineering (including security and blast), interior design, and related consulting services for clear and concise communication of the design intent to the design/build contractor who will complete and stamp the design and construct the work.  A spatial program Building Information Model (BIM) will be the minimum requirement for Preliminary and Final Concept design and approval.  Additional BIM applications (such as structural/MEP modeling, simulation, and coordination) during the bridging design process will be further defined with the selected architect prior to issuance of the scope of work.  GSA intends to extend BIM applications throughout the design/build process - including construction - and possibly facility operation.

The scope of work will require at a minimum:  drawings and specifications that become the design/builder's contract documents, cost estimates, schedules, value engineering services, life cycle costing, space planning, and construction phase services (option to be exercised at a later date) for a facility that includes site development and parking, client program requirements, and sustainable features.  

The design will incorporate P100-Facilities Standard for the Public Buildings Service and the GSA design standards for secure facilities.  It will adhere to the U.S. Courts Design Guide requirements for the U.S. District Court, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, and all Court-related space; the U.S. Marshals Service design requirements, and any other agency-specific guidelines as part of the design as well as to the Architecture Barriers Act Accessibility Standards.  The project will incorporate cost-effective and innovative strategies to meet federally-mandated EPACT 2005 energy goals to reduce energy consumption.  The design of the facility shall include sustainable design and construction practices following the LEED format with a goal of Silver and a requirement for Certification.  The deliverables from BIM shall supplement, and not replace, the PBS CAD Standard and deliverables.  The spatial program BIM deliverables shall be in accordance with the GSA's BIM Guide.  GSA will incorporate total building commissioning as defined by GSAs Building Commissioning Guide.  There will be a formal partnering process among all involved parties throughout the design and construction phases to promote successful project development and execution through voluntary commitments to accomplish established agreed-upon, mutually beneficial project objectives.


SELECTION PROCESS
This is a request for qualifications (RFQ) of A/E firms/lead designers interested in contracting for this work. For the purpose of this selection, the A/E firms/Lead Designer will be evaluated in Stage I.  The A/E firm, as used in this RFQ, means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design. The Lead Designer is the individual or the team of designers who will have primary responsibility to develop the concept design and the bridging documents.  

The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows:

Stage I 
All documentation will be in an 8 " x 11" format.  Submissions should be double-sided where feasible. The portfolio should include the following: a cover letter referencing the FBO announcement and briefly describing the A/E Firm and Lead Designer, their location/s (include address and contact telephone number), organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; Standard Form 330 Architect Engineer Qualifications Part II; and responses to the submission requirements and evaluation criteria listed below. An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer and representatives of the client and GSA will evaluate the submissions. The Board will establish a shortlist of not less than four firms. 

Submission Requirements and Evaluation Criteria: 
(1) PAST PERFORMANCE ON DESIGN (35%): The A/E Firm(s) will submit a portfolio of not more than five new construction projects completed in the last ten years (maximum of five pages per project). The narrative shall describe the context of the project and address how the design is sensitive and responsive to the surrounding architectural environment, including any relevant historical considerations, as well as how master planning considerations and landscape architecture enhance the overall project.  The narrative shall also address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client's program, function, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives-including energy conservation and life cycle cost strategies-were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution. It should describe how these goals were met and address the relevance of submitted projects to this project, with special attention to the integration of new construction into an existing context. This section of the submission should include tangible evidence such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc. demonstrating design excellence, and provide a client reference contact for each project, including name, title, address, email, phone, and fax numbers. A representative floor plan, a site plan, a building section, or other appropriate drawing, and a minimum of four photographs, some of which show the context and design response, must be included for each project. 
(2) PHILOSOPHY AND DESIGN INTENT (25%): In the Lead Designer's words (maximum of two pages), as related to this project, state: the parameters of an overall design philosophy; his/her approach to the challenge of public architecture in an existing urban setting and the historical and contextual considerations that might influence the design; parameters that may apply in creating an effective approach to accommodating new development within the context of an existing master plan; and a commitment to integrated, sustainable design, and energy conservation.
(3) LEAD DESIGNER PROFILE (15%): Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience, recognition for design efforts inclusive of the portfolio examples, and identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project.
(4) LEAD DESIGNER PORTFOLIO (25%): Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer's ability to provide design excellence, especially as it is sensitive and responsive to the surrounding architectural environment, including any relevant historical considerations.  Address his or her participation in each project. If a single designer, submit a portfolio of up to three projects completed in the last ten years (maximum of five pages per project). If the Lead Designer is a team, submit graphics and a description of up to two projects from each Lead Designer or Lead Design discipline. The narrative shall address the design philosophy with salient features for each project and discuss, contextual and urban design issues, and how the client's program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, operations, energy conservation, and maintenance objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution. Include tangible evidence such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence. Where there is duplication with criteria (1) Past Performance on Design, the Lead Designer will address his or her participation in the project. 

Stage II
The shortlisted firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. Sufficient time will be provided for the Lead Designer-A/E Design Firm to establish its team. The firms will be required to complete Standard Form 330 Architect Engineer Qualifications Parts I and II that reflect the entire design team. The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date that these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I shortlist announcement.

A networking session will be scheduled, with sufficient time set aside for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to assemble the project team.  In developing the project team for the Stage II submission, the A/E Firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed within the State of Alabama.  The office(s) meeting this 35% (minimum) requirement must have an active production office within the State of Alabama established at least 90 days prior to the date of this announcement.  This is also the stage at which the Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan described earlier is due.

The Board will interview each team. Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and evaluation criteria as established for Stage II, and demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements. Emphasis will be placed on the Lead Designer-A/E Team's understanding of the high priority aspects of the project as outlined in the project description, their design philosophy, project management process, and their cost and quality assurance plan. 

The day immediately following the interviews, GSA will convene a one-day anonymous design charrette judged by a jury of independent design professionals to get a sense of each Lead Designer-A/E Team's approach to design challenges and development of solutions.  The purpose of the charrette is to further evaluate the Lead Designer-A/E team's qualifications for the project.  The vision  developed in the charette concept will weigh substantially in the Lead Designer-A/E team's ranking. The submitted charette concepts become the property of the government. Responses to the evaluation criteria and interview questions, as well as the evaluation by the charrette jury, will be used to rank the Lead Designer-A/E teams.

US Army is seeking sources for a Variometer, NSN 5950-00-407-7305, which is used with the AN/TRN-30 Non-Directional Navigation Beacon. S ome of the technical specifications are as follows: The body of the variometer is 3.38 inches L x 3.0 inches W x 3.75 inches H. The rotor axle protrudes 1.01 inch on the drive end, and extends 0.6 inch on the free end. Some of the Variometer performance re quirements are: minimum impedance at 500KHz less than 70 Ohms, maximum impedance at 500KHz greater than 900 Ohms, self resonance greater than 1500KHz, and -Q- value greater than 200 at the maximum impedance setting. The variometer also requires a central t ap. The electrical connections to the rotating winding must to be able to tolerate thousands of consecutive turns in either direction. The assembly must be fully operable from 0 degrees Fahrenheit to 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The Government owns drawings, in cluding the full test specification for the existing variometer, and they are available to potential bidders upon request. Please note the age of the Government drawings - the Variometer drawings were prepared circa 1970, and they may cite parts which are no longer available. The original equipment manufacturer for the AN/TRN-30 was Hoffman Electronics, El Monte, California. The company presently appears to be named NAVCOM Electronics. The Beacon itself was last procured by the government in 1990 and that m anufacturer, Cage Code. 0D2L6, is no longer active. The Government expects to buy 25 variometers with options for additional quantities. The POC for this survey is Mr. Russell Brown,EMAIL ADDRESS: russell.brown@mail1.monmouth.army.mil, (732) 532-3831.

<CONTACT>Terry Traino, (732) 532-2675
<DESC>CONTACT Dylan Chung, Electronics Engineer. This is a market survey to establish source capability for designing, developing and manufacturing a flight-qualified Dual Stabilator Controller (DSC). The DSC is a single-box, high-reliability replacement f or the two Stabilator Amplifiers installed in the UH-60 A/L Black Hawk Helicopter. It is currently being developed by a team from Sikorsky and Hamilton Sundstrand under contract W58RGZ-05-D-0309. The product specifications for the DSC are also being certif ied by Aviation Engineering Directorate (AED). The resulting documentation  a performance requirements specification SES-703750 and an interface control document SER-703562 is available in draft format for the interested manufacturers. These documents are  subject to change. The government expects final approval of the two documents to be completed in August 2006 and may be issued to those who request it. The equipment offered in response to this requirement must be flight qualified by AED and meet the Requ irements Specification, SES-703750, for the DSC and the provisions of Interface Control Document, SER-703562, prior to product acceptance. The flight-qualified production DSC to be procured in response to the formal Army solicitation shall as a minimum hav e the following capabilities: A) Meet the requirements of the Requirements Specification, SES-703750, for the Dual Stabilator Controller and the provisions of Interface Control Document, SER-703562. B) Operate with the Automated Flight Control System. C)	Mechanical mounting characteristics such that the DSC can be mounted to existing aircraft holes per SER-703562.

<DESC>CONTACT Michael E. Harris, Senior Logistics Engineer,732-532-2453. This is a broad, community-specific market survey to locate sources for supply of numerous avionics items that are currently in short supply within the Army and are needed immediately  to support Army Aviation. In many cases, OEM suppliers are unable to produce sufficient quantities to meet our current needs. Thus, we are interested in buying assets from alternative sources. Depending upon specific circumstances for the items in questio n, we might be interested in buying new stock, new old stock, reconditioned items, or, in some cases, unserviceable items. In some cases, this material may have been purchased by suppliers as surplus equipment. Depending upon respondents capabilities and the current status of our organic depot repair programs, we might be interested in having the supplier perform refurbishment-repair-overhaul. Alternatively, we might want to buy the unserviceable assets and induct these into ongoing organic repair programs  that are operating below capacity because of the longstanding paucity of unserviceable returns from the field.  Regardless of specific circumstances, any company that possesses ANY significant quantity of Army avionics is encouraged to respond with inform ation regarding those assets that they have available. We have a list of key NSNs of interest that will be provided via e-mail upon request. We are looking for hardware assets, not repair services. Companies capable of performing this effort may respond by  writing to: Commander, USA CECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-CCS-N-AN (MICHAEL E. HARRIS), Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5403 or alternatively, contact us via e-mail at: EMAIL ADDRESS: avionics@mail1.monmouth.army.mil. This synopsis is for informational purposes only and n ot an offer for proposal. For more information, contact Michael E. Harris (732) 532-2453. The deadline for response to this notice is 18 August 2006. EMAIL ADDRESS: avionics@mail1.monmouth.army.mil

<SUBJECT>F--Wild Horse Adoption/Holding Facility in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio or Tennessee
<SOLNBR>NAR060216
<RESPDATE>083106
<ARCHDATE>07192007
<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for a Wild Horse Adoption/Holding Facility to maintain an average of 178 animals from November 1, 2006 through October 31, 2007, with 2 additional one year option periods. The facility must be located in one of the following states: Illinois, Indiana, Ohio or Tennessee. The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed for a Wild Horse & Burro Adoption/Holding Facility: a. The wild horses and burros ranging on the public lands administered by the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and United States Forest Service have been protected since passage of Public Law 92-195, December 15, 1971. The number of wild horses and burros on the public land are maintained to sustain rangeland health and promote healthy ecosystems. This requires periodic gathering and removal. In order to provide acceptable homes for the removed animals the "Adopt-A-Horse and Burro" program was initiated. b. As wild horses and burros are gathered, qualified applicants may "adopt" a wild horse and burro.  Animals 11 years and older, and those that have been to 3 adoptions without being placed into private care, may be sold.  At the present time, over 200,000 horses and burros have been "adopted" by individuals throughout the United States. Many people desiring to "adopt" a wild horse or burro cannot afford to travel to the western states, so the Government brings the horses and burros to the people in the East. Scope: The intent of this requirement is to provide for a centrally located Contractor-owned or leased facility to be known as an Adoption/Holding facility for wild horses and burros.  During advertised adoption dates, and by scheduled appointment, the animals in adoptable condition at the facility will be made available for adoption. The facility will be used to rest and acclimate animals to the East and prepare them to be sent to the next adoption. Sick/Quarantine/Rehabilitation animals shall be kept in the facility in separate pens. In addition, the Contractor shall provide the administrative support and equipment;  the facilities and equipment to load and unload animals, hold, doctor, store supplies, schedule veterinarian care; and the supervision and services to unload, feed, water, maintain, halter and load wild horses and burros for the BLM's "Adopt-A-Horse and Burro" program at the Adoption/Holding facility. Specific Requirements: The Contractor shall provide all permanent inside corral fences and gates for the facility at a minimum of six (6) feet high and all outside corral fences and gates at a minimum of seven (7) feet high. An alleyway, 12 feet wide adjoining the individual corrals is required. Alley fences and gates shall be equal but not limited to a minimum of 16 gauge panels as manufactured by WW Construction; be able to accept animals, as necessary, from Satellite adoptions, other Government facilities, BLM personnel or their haulers, and adopters. Animals should have current updated health certificates on State Veterinarian approved forms (i.e., negative Coggins test, vaccinations, etc.). In rare instances, this health documentation may not be obtainable until the animal is at the facility and a veterinarian treats the animal. These deliveries will be coordinated with the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) whenever possible. In the event that the COR cannot be reached, BLM will notify the Contractor at least 2 hours in advance of any animals to be delivered. The Contractor is responsible for maintaining the health and welfare of the animals until such time as the COR can be reached; Oversee regular health maintenance of all animals at the facility, including hoof trimming, worming, and inoculations. At such time that animals are in need of updated veterinary care, the Contractor will notify the BLM COR prior to providing routine health maintenance treatments. In cases where the animals require immediate medical attention, the Contractor will attempt to obtain approval from the COR prior to treatment. If the COR cannot be reached, the Contractor may contact the veterinarian and obtain the needed advice/visits for treatment. The Contractor will provide written notification to the COR within 48 hours after treatment has been provided; BLM officials will, upon approval by the COR, be provided with access to the animals, corrals, and facility at all times. BLM officials may bring guests, adopters, photographers, press, or other members of the general public to the facility at any time. If BLM wishes access later than 5:00 P.M., the Contractor will be provided with at least 2 hours advance notice. At any time, the Contractor may be required to move animals, load and unload animals, and otherwise handle animals for the purpose of business conducted by BLM; Keep the facilities in a sanitary condition. The Contractor is responsible for all cleaning materials, supplies, and equipment. At a minimum, the Contractor must have the following equipment in order to maintain the facility: heavy duty bobcat/tractor or dozer with a bucket and blade, manure spreader if manure is to be spread, hay wagon, covered hay storage area where hay can be stored dry and equipment needed to maintain the facility. Accumulated manure and old hay in corrals shall be scraped and removed once a week at a minimum. The Contractor is responsible for disposal of manure and waste in accordance with all applicable County, State and Federal regulations and laws. Compliance will be monitored by BLM. Maintain gravel or other permeable footing in all corrals, shelters, alleyways, the sick barn, and public walkways. Materials shall be added or replaced a minimum of once a month or as directed by the COR; Grade corrals and associated areas to facilitate drainage and avoid standing water. This is not intended to be a complete list of the specifications. The full requirement will be posted in solicitation NAR060216, which will be available at http://www.fbo.gov on or about August 2, 2006. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Facsimile proposals will not be accepted. Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the University of Colorado for making experimental and theoretical studies to realize quantum information processing protocols using robust ion qubits.  It is essential this research take place in a close proximity so that NIST and the researchers can work closely together.  The general techniques involve using Mg+ ions as refrigerant ions to sympathetically laser cool Be+ qubit ions that are based on field independent transitions and incorporate particular laser detunings that prevent spontaneous emission decoherence.   Using this system, the project will implement quantum computing primitives in a multi-zone ion trap.  The following tasks will be completed:
(1) Generate and entangle field-independent qubits and distribute to separate trapping zones.
(2) Carry out quantum dense coding protocol in separate trapping zones
(3) Perform theoretical studies of how to reduce decoherence in multi-zone traps using field-independent qubits and particular laser detunings.

<DESC>The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), San Carlos Irrigation Project (SCIP) has a requirement for the rehabilitation of the China Wash Flume.  The China Wash flume is a reinforced concrete flume on SCIP.  It is located approximately 8 miles east of Florence Arizona, or about a 90 minute drive from downtown Phoenix.  The structure is located immediately adjacent to a road and is readily accessible.  The flume was constructed in 1927 and is used to convey water over a dry desert arroyo, bridging a span of approximately 70 feet.  The flume is a unique design consisting of four 12-foot diameter, 6-inch thick, reinforced concrete semi-circular barrels.  The barrels are suspended from 5 concrete arches by steel suspension rods.  Corrosion of the reinforcement bar (rebar) located within the concrete barrels has resulted in the cracking and spalling of the exterior concrete surface of the barrels.  The rehabilitation includes removal of the deteriorated concrete from the exterior of the barrels, repair/replacement of deteriorated rebar as needed, installation of a sacrificial anode system, and surface preparation and augmentation of the repaired areas with a quality concrete cover.  In addition, concrete retaining walls located under the structure are exhibiting deterioration and will require repair similar to that described above for the barrels.  The sealing of the interior of the barrels with a methacrylic sealer, the replacement of lateral braces between the arches, and other minor repairs will also be required.   The entire irrigation system is routinely scheduled for a dry-up during the month of November.  During this period no water will be flowing thru the flume.  It is projected that the project will take approximately two months to complete.  It will be necessary to complete any work requiring a dry flume during the November dry-up.  Estimated Project Amount:  $250,000.00 to $500,000.00  REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) ISSUE DATE on or about AUGUST 2, 2006.  ONLY WRITTEN OR FAX REQUESTS for RFP will be accepted.  FAX No. (602) 379-6763.  NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE. RFP DUE DATE: SEPTEMBER 1, 2006.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Contract Action.  The Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards AFB CA. (AFFTC) intends to modify an existing contract for diversity branch selectors.  The diversity branch selectors were developed by RF Networks, Inc., 10201 North 21st Avenue, Unit 9, Phoenix, AZ  85021-1827.  The modification would result in two upgrades to the diversity branch selectors.  The award will result in a modification to a five year, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract to RF Networks, Inc.  The two upgrades to be performed on the diversity branch selectors include:  1)  The development and addition of remote control functionality via the existing maintenance port.  This interface shall be implemented to ensure that all front panel functions of the Diversity Branch Selector may be accessed and controlled via said interface while at the same time preserving current maintenance port functionality.  2)  The addition of front panel display of Signal Degradation Indication (SDI) messages received from remotely connected demodulators.  This mode shall display smoothed SDI message content statistics to the front panel.  

The NAICS code is 334220 and the size is 750 employees.  Qualified contractors must submit clear and convincing documentation that fully defines their capability to meet the requirement.  Documentation that fails to provide the required capability documentation will not be acknowledged.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.

<CONTACT>Brenda Goodwin, Contract Specialist, Phone (304)285-5882, Fax (304)285-6083, Email bcg1@cdc.gov
<DESC>Research Data Collection, Benchmarking: 

The Centers for Disease Control,  Division of Emergency and Environmental Health Services (EEHS), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), conducts prevention programs designed to control disease, disability, and death that result from interactions between people and the environment.  The Division established the Public Health Built Environment Initiative in 2006 to address research and operational needs associated with the public health impact of the built environment.   The EEHS, Public Health Built Environment Initiative (PHBEI) provides ongoing research consultation and technical assistance to ensure implementation of CDCs guidelines within the CDC Healthy Communities Goals Process.  A key challenge for this program is the identification and support of research and the development of recommendations that strengthen the relationship between the built environment and public health.   The challenge for public health practitioners and policy makers is to improve public health through healthy community building practices and transportation alternatives. The CDC Public Health Built Environment Initiative is committed to attaining these objectives through contract resources. 

The purpose of this project is to collect data for all of the 50 states and at least 50 of the largest U.S. cities to measure the effectiveness of walking and bicycling programs, projects and policies, safe routes to school, safety programs staffing and funding and transportation policies.   A sample of the 20 essential data sets to be identified includes:      Bicycling and walking mode share;     Per capita pedestrian and bicycle miles traveled;     Miles of existing pedestrian and bicycle facilities;    Statewide bicycle and pedestrian fatalities;     Obesity rates;     Diabetes rates; and     Bike access on transit.   This project is consistent with CDC Healthy Community and Healthy Travel Goals.  

The identified contractor will provide expert advice and direct services in obtaining and organizing the benchmarking data and developing the raw data into a publishable Monograph as a project deliverable.  The Monograph will have the impact of increasing the current knowledge-base and shall provide support for a clear and defendable relationship between active transportation mode design and improved public health.

This project is expected to be awarded by August 31, 2006, and the period of performance will be for 12 months after date of award.
 
In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b), the only known organization that has the unique blend of capacity and recent specific experience in conducting this type of benchmarking to conduct a bicycle and pedestrian benchmarking project of this size and complexity is the Thunderhead Alliance, Prescott, Arizona.  The Thunderhead Alliance is the national coalition of state and local bicycle and pedestrian advocacy organizations working in unison to break down the barriers to safe bicycling and walking in North American communities.  There are currently 119 member organizations in 48 states.   
 
This project requires and organization that possesses at a minimum the following:  (1)     Demonstrated expertise in conducting benchmarking projects; and  (2)   Access to the resources of bicycle and pedestrian advocacy organizations representing state organizations.   No solicitation is available however, interested parties may request a copy of the Statement of Work including deliverables.

Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit  to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their written capabilities statement and other supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.     Please submit capabilities and supporting information to:     Brenda L. Goodwin, REFERENCE:     HCTBB-2006-33323,     CDC/PGO/AAFB, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV     26505, v 304/285-5882, fax 304/285-6083 or e-mail bcg1@cdc.gov.       The Government will review any/all capabilities statement and supporting information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could perform the effort.     Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.           

If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, negotiations will be conducted on a sole source basis with the Thunderhead Alliance, Prescott, AZ  as the only source meeting our needs and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  Upgrade of existing BD Biosciences LSR II Flow Cytometer

Purpose/Brief History:

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to upgrade an existing BD Biosciences LSR II Flow Cytometry system, with a Green Laser (532 nm) and a trigon with three new PMTs, as well as a replacement solid state red laser from BD Biosciences.

The upgrade shall be assembled on an existing LSR II System and it will be used for flow cytometric analysis of cells to allow NCI to analyze multiple markers (up to 11 different markers) on a single cell. The system shall: 1) Be capable of producing laser at 532 nm with no less than 150 mW of the power;  2) Be able to physically fit in the existing LSR II system;  3) Be able to exchange existing red (638 nm) laser to solid-state red laser with the power no less than 30 mW; and 4) Possess simultaneous or sequential  multi-dye capability. 

BD Biosciences is the only source known to NCI that offers an upgrade to the existing LSR II System manufactured by BD Biosciences. Also, the existing service contract with BD Biosciences might be voided if any non-BD Biosciences components were installed by a third party.


PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 

Justification:

The existing BD Biosciences LSR II Flow Cytometer was manufactured by BD Biosciences, and no other company can modify it to provide the needed upgrade.  Therefore, no other sources exist.

<B>Synopsis of Requirements :</B>
<P>
The Social Security Administration (SSA) will replace its current Private Branch eXchange (PBX) telephony systems at specified sites with an Enterprise Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony solution, to support current and future requirements and the transition to Internet Protocol (IP) Telephony, hereafter known as the Telephone Systems Replacement Project (TRSP). The SSAs current PBX systems have limitations that impact productivity, efficiency, and cost in completing the Agencys mission.  In addition, there are concerns about the technical support for the existing PBX systems.  The target Enterprise VoIP architecture for the replacement system will utilize centralized call processing equipment located on Agency premises and several premise based systems, employing an Agency-provided data network infrastructure for transport.  This VoIP system architecture will provide greater functionality, interoperability, flexibility, survivability and a consolidated operational and management infrastructure.  It will be a robust, scalable, and flexible infrastructure that will provide significant business value in the near term, and will best position the Agency for the future.  The solution will deliver a single logical system that will provide telephone, Automatic Call Distribution (ACD), Automated Attendant (AA), Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and voicemail services across Agencys Headquarters and Field Office organizations, including 10 regional offices, 6 Program Service Centers, and over 1500 Field Offices, to name a few.  
<P>
The TSRP solution will consist of contractor provided hardware, software, and professional services to install and integrate the TSRP solution with the SSAs GFE, and remove the end of life telephony systems.  The GFE include the Agencys Wide Area Network (WAN) and Local Area Network (LAN) network infrastructure, and WAN and PSTN transport facilities and services. The Contractor will provide a migration path from the existing key system voice platform to support telephony and other voice communication sessions among people who are geographically dispersed though an innovative, comprehensive solution that combines, voice, video, and data applications on the Agencys existing data network infrastructure. TSRP will also include a Contractor provided Managed Services component for addressing the management, control, administration and maintenance of the enterprise VoIP solution.  These services will entail close cooperation with the Agencys current Information Technology (IT) groups, as well as the Agencys GFE and provider(s).  
<P>
The upcoming TSRP solicitation will fully specify the following contractor provided supplies and services:
<P>
1.	Connectivity between hardware, software, and telecommunications equipment.
<P>
2.	A single logical telephony system for the Agencys existing Field Offices. 
<P>
3.	Multiple single site telephony systems for some of the Agencys large sites and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) locations.
<P>
4.	Specifications required to engineer, furnish, integrate, install, test, and place in service (cutover) the TSRP solution, as well as support of the System equipment.
<P>
5.	Training of government personnel.
<P>
6.	Ongoing on-site maintenance and management with trained and certified individuals.
<P>
7.	Removal and disposal of obsolete telephony equipment from the Agencys offices.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The CROWS is a remote weapon station capable of  mounting the MK19 grenade machine gun (GMG), M2 HB machine gun (MG), M240B  machine gun (MG) or M249 squad automatic weapon (SAW).  The CROWS is a multi- vehicle weapon mounting and control system which will allow the gunner to  remain inside the vehicle protected by armor while firing the weapon.  The  CROWS provides remote day and night sighting, ballistic control capability,  remote weapon charging, and first burst engagement of targets at the maximum  effective range of the weapon.  The CROWS weapon and sight are stabilized for  on-the-move identification and engagement of targets.  The CROWS will include  as a minimum: the weapon mount above the roof to include sensors, a fire  control processor, display and controls, and other associated hardware.  The  CROWS will be integrated into various turreted/non-turreted and ring-mount  equipped vehicles and will provide a modern automated weapon system that  enhances system lethality, increases battle space awareness, and provides  digital integration opportunities.  The CROWS will provide protection for the  gunner and enhanced target acquisition, identification, and engagement  capabilities to non-turreted armored vehicles which currently place the  unprotected gunner at high risk from enemy direct and indirect fire weapon  systems.  The Solicitation number for this is W15QKN-06-R-1409.  The present  schedule projects a release of a Draft Solicitation on or about 1 August 06  consisting of the Statement of Work, Performance Specification, Section  B Supplies or Services and Price/Cost, F Deliveries or Performance,  L Instrs., Conds., and Notices to Offerors and M Evaluation Factors for  Award.

This will be issued as an amendment to the solicitation  number W15QKN-06-R-1409.   Proposals and one complete bid sample unit will be  required within sixty (60) days after release of the final RFP.  All responses  to this notice shall be in writing in the English language.

11.	Has the Corporation considered digitizing existing paper content in order to place it into a Document or RM System? If so, are any scanning systems or products already deployed and in use?  Yes.  One office currently has one in existence.

12.	Is there a designated Records Officer or other individual responsible for the Corporations RM program?  What staff is dedicated, full- or part-time, to the RM program across the enterprise?  See question #1.

13.	Does the Corporation have a NARA-approved records retention schedule?  Yes.  

14.	Please describe the Corporation's draft policies and procedures on record/file management.   Is there a policy manual, and if so, how many procedures does the manual contain?  What is the version date of the current manual?  See question #6.  

15.	Has funding for this project been approved?  Yes.

16.	How many departments will need to be interviewed?  See question #2.

29.	 What type of contract is anticipated?

31.	 Is there a preferred database platform?  Oracle is preferred. 

32.	Can we be provided with the document management and records management policies for the agency, at this time?  See Question #6

33.	How will the requirements of the Corporation State Offices, the Service Centers, and the residential campuses be accommodated?  Will the analysis depend on information obtained from the Washington, D.C. sources, or will trips to the above offices be needed.  The requirements will be determined by the interview process and accommodated by the contractor solution.

34.	Often in projects of this nature the recommending contractor is prohibited from performing the implementation effort.  As the product of this service, should implementation of new technology or applications be recommended, will the OIS or the contractor perform the implementation services?  This is to be determined based upon the solution. 

35.	 Can the Corporation provide a scope of the volume of policies and procedures to be considered under this award?  Relative to this consideration, do the major national service initiatives: AmeriCorp, VISTA and the NCCC share, or use common procedures and adhere to standard Corporation policies?  If each is autonomous in their practices, how should similar or competing policies and procedures be reconciled?  Who will serve as the mitigating authority?  How will this work apply to the local and national non-profit organizations?  Records management policy is standard for all offices.  There is no direct impact on local and non-profit organizations. 

36.	 What is the current state and complexity of existing RM policies (number of record types, complexity of disposition rules, and security rules...etc)?  Are these managed at an organizational or departmental level?  If departmental, how many departments?  Is the goal moving forward to bring the policies up to an organizational level?  See Question #6 for current policies.  The purpose of this requirement is to review the state of the Corporations current records management environment.  The solution will be agency-wide.

37.	 Based on the current procedures, and geographic disbursement of records, do you expect that travel will be needed outside the DC area?  See Question #3 

38.	 How old are the current policies, and will we be dealing with inherited policies from other organizations?  See Question #6  

39.	 Which applicable authority policies have already applied in some fashion at CNCS?   What analysis has been performed to define the applicable policies?  See Question #6 

40.	 What is the distribution and volume of hard copy vs. soft copy records?  This is to be determined by the contractor.  

41.	 If awarded a contract to perform the analysis of the records management system, it is our understanding that we would not be precluded from any opportunity related to the implementation of a records management system.  Please confirm this understanding.  See answer to Question #42 

42.	 Our company has a COTS product that is DoD 5015.2 certified and integrates with Microsoft SharePoint and IBM DB2 Records Manager. If our company commits (upon award of the review and evaluation contract) to not competing in any follow on work that involves award to a solution for records management functionality at the Corporation for National and Community Service does that mitigate sufficiently any Organizational Conflict of Interest on Solicitation Number: HQMBR0601?  The awardee is not be precluded from implementation unless it is proposing its own product and that product is selected as one of the COTS solutions.  The awardee will then be prohibited from participation in the implementation follow-on effort.  An amendment to the RFP will be issued to add the following language to the Statement of Work, Section B, Description of Services, paragraph 1d:

If a COTS solution is proposed that is exclusively marketed by the contractor, the contractor will be precluded from award of the implementation contract.

43.	 In the past 2 years has the Corporation contracted with a vendor for similar RM or RM technology consulting.  No.

44.	 Has the Corporation performed any internal (formal or informal) review of available technology solutions?  No.  

45.	 If yes, is the Corporation predisposed to a particular solution.  No.

46.	 Are there any electronic document management systems currently installed in Corporation of National and Community Service or custodial corporations?  See Question #10 

47.	  What is the Corporations estimate for the number of key stakeholders that would need to be interviewed during the data collection period?  See Question #2 

48.	 What is the Corporations estimate for the number of days between the submission of the COTS solution report and the decision as to which records management solution will be implemented?  This cannot be determined at this time.  

49.	 The overall period of performance is stated as 270 days.  Is it anticipated that this time will include the possible additional services cited in paragraph F?  No. 

50.	 All meetings/interviews are described as being in Washington, DC.  The contributions of residential campus staff and service center staff may be important to this study effort.  Will select employees from the residential campus staff and/or service center staff be available for interview at the 1201 New York Avenue, Washington, DC location?  Will it be necessary to for the study team to travel to select residential campus or service center sites?  If so, does the Corporation have an estimate for the number, location and duration of that travel?  See Question #3 

51.	 How many users will be using the Record Management Application?  To be determined by the study proposed by the awardee. 

52.	 The Solicitation is Full and Open? or set aside for Small Business, 8(a)...?  This solicitation is full and open.  It is not set aside for small business or 8(a).

53.	  Why travel to only one Corporation State Office, Service Center or residential campus?  (NOTE: Many records of the Corporation may be located only at these places and to perform a Records management analysis for the Corporation as a whole; we feel that a representative sample of these locations must be included.  Same concern for the analysis of records regarding the Department of Agricultures National Finance Center and the Department of Health and Human Services Payment Management System.)  Records management policy and types are standard for all Corporation offices.

54.	 Does this effort involve reviewing and revising the Corporation File Plan and Retention Schedule?  Yes.

55.	 Please provide the link to, or the documents that are the Corporations current policies and procedures.  See Question #6

56.	 What is the relation of the period of performance of 270 days to when the COTS solution report is due (75 days into contract)?  (NOTE: In our professional opinion, the time to perform the analysis of all of the potential sources of records (as indicated by the list in the RFQ) prior to the stated date of presenting potential COTS solutions is very questionable and could result in inaccurate and incomplete data.  This is the Corporations established timetable.

57.	 Does the Corporation understand that at this point, not knowing the scope of policies and procedures and not having the interviews and recommendation completed, it would be highly unlikely that the revision of policies and procedures could be accomplished (and even estimated) within the time frame stated in the RFQ of 45 days?  This is the last deliverable called for in the request for proposal.

58.	 Does the Corporation currently recognize electronic records? (NOTE: Policies and procedures can be revised based on changes to the Corporations stance on electronic records, but cannot be completed until a design of the electronic solution is completed.  The requirement to Prepare a draft of the additional policies and procedures the Corporation will need to adopt to insure compliance with all National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) records management program requirements based on the records management solution selected cannot be addressed fully until the system is designed.  No electronic records management system can be successful when installed as a purely vanilla off-the-shelf system, particularly is it is intended to capture electronic records generated from other systems.)  We are expecting a COTS solution.

59.	 Does the Corporation use any electronic document management systems?  See Question #10

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Biology Resource Division (BRD), has a requirement for products and services for updating species range maps and conservation status information. This initiative proposes to update range maps and conservation status information of the native freshwater mussels of the United States and the native and exotic amphibians of the southeastern United States as well as threatened species elsewhere in the country. This effort builds upon earlier work already completed by NatureServe. NatureServe has already produced first generation maps for all amphibians and half of the mussel species.  The effort will allow NatureServe to significantly improve, enhance, and update the existing amphibian and mussel maps as well as develop maps for mussels not yet mapped.  NatureServe has already invested well more than $300K in mussel and amphibian conservation status assessments and maps over the past 10-20 years.  This erffort will build on that previous investment to insure that the status assessments are based on the most current information available.   Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the item specified as a sole source to Nature Serve, 1101 Wilson Blvd., 15th Floor, Arlington, VA 22209 and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and supplies are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. Affirmative response shall be received by this office by close of business August 02, 2006 by 3:00 PM Mountain Standard Time. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement. Email information to gwalker@usgs.gov.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Femtosecond Fiber Laser System
<SOLNBR>NB848000680013
<RESPDATE>080406
<ARCHDATE>08072006
<CONTACT>Doris Turner, Purchasing Agent, Phone (303) 497-3872, Fax (303) 497-3163, Email doris.p.turner@noaa.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Boulder CO proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)with Calmar Optcom, Sunnyvale, CA for a femtosecond fiber laser. NIST requires a turn-key, portable, 775-780 nm, femtosecond laser for use in spectral interferometry and nonlinear microscopy measurements.

Required Specifications:
To facilitate integration into the experiment, the laser must be highly integrated into a compact module of less than 150 mm by 150 mm by 50 mm dimensions. The optical head must contain the pump source, gain medium, and all frequency conversion (e.g. harmonic generation) optics, so that only one connection to a power supply, and no other input is required for operation. When turned on, the laser shall produce femtosecond pulses without user intervention, so that non-specialists can use it.  The laser shall also provide an electrical synchronization signal without the need for additional detectors.

Optical specifications:  
Minimum of 10 mW average power, typical greater than or equal to 20 mW
Pulse energy greater than 0.8 nJ
775-780 nm center wavelength
pulse duration less than 100 fs
pulse pedestal of less than or equal to 2%
spectral bandwidth greater than 10 nm
repetition rate 20-100 MHz  
pulse energy stability (for temperature controlled to 25 plus/minus 0.5 C) of less than 0.5% in a 1 hour period
center wavelength stability < 2% (for temperature controlled to 25 plus/minus 0.5 C) 
Beam pointing stability less than 20 microRadians
Mode quality, M2 less than 1.3 
Beam circularity greater than 0.9 
Free space, linearly polarized, optically isolated output

The only type of laser that can meet these requirements is the second harmonic (SHG) of a passively mode-locked Er-doped fiber laser.  The energy and wavelength stability, power output, pulse duration, and spectral bandwidth requirements will ensure that the laser has sufficient versatility for several types of experiments.  In particular, the pulse energy specification (average power/repetition rate) is required to ensure that the laser has enough peak power to perform multiphoton measurements. The use of only one laser will be more cost-effective than purchasing separate lasers for each experiment. High beam pointing stability is required to ensure that the optical setup does not require realignment due to laser beam drift. Lasers for which the manufacture declines to specify a value of beam pointing are not acceptable. The circularity and Gaussian mode specifications are required to ensure the output beam can be tightly focused for high spatial resolution measurements. Lasers for which both parameters are not specified are not acceptable. Linear polarized output is required for nonlinear optical measurements. Optical isolation is required to ensure that back-reflections do not disturb operation of the laser.

The optical head shall meet the size requirements to fit into an existing interferometry experiment.  Systems with an optical head larger than the specified dimension are not acceptable.  A system that requires an external SHG module attached to the laser head via fiber-coupling or mechanical connection is not acceptable, because mounting of the external unit could potentially lead to variability in SHG output. For integration into existing designs, the SHG output must be free-space, not fiber-coupled. The electrical synchronization signal is required to monitor the pulse train. Systems that do not provide this signal, or that require the use of an additional detector via a seed-monitor port are not acceptable, because the addition of more components will involve more expense, and require additional optical alignment and will therefore complicate the experiments.

To ensure the manufacturer has enough experience with these technologies to deliver a reliable product for our application we require that the manufacturer must have already delivered passively mode-locked fiber lasers with 775-780 nm output to other customers. This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000). Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether on not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Governments best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Anticipated award date is August 4, 2006.

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration intends to award a sole source contract to Shannon and Wilson, Inc., of Seattle, Washington, in the approximate amount of $35,000.00, pursuant to the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 6.3 (48 CFR 6.3). The anticipated award date is August 31, 2006, with an estimated period of performance extending 4 months from the date of the award.   Regulations require that the controlling locomotive of all trains on an equipped line be capable of using the train control system, so applying a system to permit high-speed rail necessarily impacts freight equipment and operations on those routes as well. The FRAs goal is to maximize the capacity of railroads to carry a mix of high-speed passenger, commuter, and freight trains with minimal risk of collisions and accidents and at considerably lower installation cost than for conventional railroad signal and control systems. The FRA has been searching for techniques for eliminating or reducing the adverse effects of settlement at railroad bridge approaches, based on an understanding of the true source of the problem. Previous applications of concepts based on the conventional explanation of the problem, as caused by a change in track stiffness between approach and bridge, have all failed to produce any successful or even promising results. Thus, the need is to have proposed solutions from a source with a correct understanding of the problem and the apparent expertise and insight to develop promising solutions. Despite years of searching, both formally and informally, such sources have not appeared previously. This is a non-competitive acquisition and no solicitation is available. The Federal Railroad Administrations justification for the lack of competition is: the unsolicited proposal recently received from Shannon & Wilson is the only one from a source appearing to understand that the conventional explanation of the bridge approach problem is incorrect; their proposal provided an apparent understanding of the correct source of the problem and how it might be addressed. Any responses to this solicitation will be evaluated in accordance with applicable FAR requirements. Interested sources must submit a fully descriptive statement of qualifications, including the resumes of key personnel, by 2:00 pm, July 26, 2006.  The closing date for this notice is 8:00 am, on August 2, 2006. Qualification statements and resumes may be sent to the above address, or via fax to (202) 493 6171, or via email to natalie.burgess@dot.gov.

THIS NOTICE IS ONLY FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of Public Health and Science is seeking capabilities statements from organizations with the core competency to provide goods and services towards a 2007 National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey (NBCUS).  The NBCUS is a comprehensive survey of blood and blood products establishments which ultimately facilitate DHHS and the PHS Agencies in formulation of national policy regarding the blood supply.  The NAICS Code is 541690 and the size standard is $6.5M.  The contractor will need to work with all relevant stakeholders in the formation of the questionnaire.  Historically, the NBCUS is an approximately 200 question national survey of 3000+ blood banks and blood collection centers which addresses all aspects of blood collection and utilization ranging from amounts of various products to efficacious use of blood regulatory standards.  The DHHS intends to survey these facilities regarding their entire 2006 calendar year data; the data collected will need to be analyzed for specific findings and then compared to previous data to look for patterns.  Additionally, the concept of Bio-vigilance patient safety monitoring will need to be utilized in the formation of the questionnaire.  The capability statement should address all the following capabilities (a) experience and expertise in bringing relevant stakeholders together for the purpose of designing a comprehensive blood products related national questionnaire of relevance to the federal governments role in public health service policy formation.  (b) detailed knowledge of systems involved in the blood and blood products community such as collecting, processing, distributing and transfusing blood products. (c) knowledge of blood inventory management practices used by blood collection centers and hospital-based transfusion services (contractor must demonstrate an understanding of blood inventory accounting concepts and statistics) (d) expertise in federal public health responsibilities, current policies and programs relating to the safety and availability of blood and (e) demonstrated experience in building business relationships with and communicating effectively with key staff of blood collection centers and hospital transfusion services. Experience in recruiting and retaining organizational participation in programs similar to the NBCUS would be a plus. Interested contractors possessing ALL of the required capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a cover letter along with a capability statement not to exceed 10 pages demonstrating the ability to perform ALL aspects of the effort described therein. Responses must include the following: name and address of the firm, named central point of contact along with email address; DUNS number; any applicable commercial price list(s); size of business, including average annual revenues for the past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are a large, small, small-disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, woman-owned, veteran-owned, or service-disabled veteran-owned historically black college or university and/or minority service institute, number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners; list of customers covering the past five years; and additional documentation such as company literature and brochures. If this additional documentation supports the required capabilities it is incumbent to address this reference in the cover letter or other area of the capability statement and indicate specifically how it addresses the capabilities sought. A mere referenced website is unacceptable for purposes of this announcement and will not be considered or reviewed. Capability statements must be submitted via email to pscacquisitions@psc.gov to the attention of Jonathan Hamlet and referencing this announcement number. No statements delivered by mail or by hand shall be accepted under any circumstances. Responses are due no later than 12:00 PM Eastern Time, August 4, 2006

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking existing qualified community based health care providers capable of providing a variety of consultative examinations related to claimant disability cases pending before the Agency.  Such cases involve issues under Title II, Disability and Title XVI, Supplemental Security Income, of the Social Security Act, as amended.   

Consultative examinations may include physical or mental examinations and/or ancillary tests and laboratory studies (for example, pulmonary function studies, psychological tests, x-rays, or blood studies).   The purpose of providing consultative examinations, ancillary tests and laboratory studies is to provide SSA with the additional medical evidence required to complete the adjudication of a claim for disability benefits under either Title II or Title XVI.   As appropriate, any available relevant claimant medical background information will be provided as part of the request for examination. 

To be considered qualified an existing community based health care provider must meet the following minimum qualifications: 

A) Employ or contract physicians representing multiple medical specialties qualified to perform physical and mental evaluations.  Each specialty must be capable of providing at least five physicians.   Or, employ or contract physicians representing one specific specialty qualified to perform physical or mental evaluations.  The one specific specialty provider must be capable of providing at least ten physicians;  

B) Have a facility or facilities that is/are properly equipped, maintained according to local health department standards and is/are ADA compliant;  

C) Have an infrastructure that supports electronic dissemination of medical information under secure conditions;

D) Have a corporate and management structure that can support the oversight and administration of a contract to provide physical and mental consultative examinations according to SSA Disability Service Improvement guidelines and procedures.  For more information on SSAs Disability Service Improvement process, see the Federal Register (Vol 71, Number 62, March 31, 2006), pp. 16423-16462;

E) Able to provide responsive service by conducting examinations within 21 to 30 days of request; 

F) Ideally, the facility or combination of facilities should be able to support a large geographic area where public transportation is available; and  

G) The scope of this coverage would be the SSA Boston Region which consists of the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Vermont but one source would not be expected to provide coverage for the entire region.  

Persons under your employ or contract who may provide the examinations should possess the following individual qualifications:

A) All personnel performing work under this contract would need to undergo a suitability clearance/background check;

B) All physicians would have to submit proof of licensing and board certification to perform under this contract;

C) All medical support personnel would be required to submit proof of professional credentials, certificates and training necessary to work under the contract;

D) An experienced project manager would be required to oversee and administer the contract and serve as a contact point for SSA on administrative issues; and

E) All personnel working under the contract would be subject to confidentiality of claimant information and may be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement.

The process SSA envisions would be: (1) to have SSA contact the provider regarding scheduling a consultative examination and electronically provide the request details along with relevant background information, (2) the medical source would provide scheduling information and conduct a consultative examination within 21 to 30 days, and (3) the medical source would electronically transmit the results of the examination and/or tests back to SSA.  After acceptance of a complete report, SSA would reimburse the source for services requested and rendered.  In some cases it may be necessary to fax information to the source, in which case the sources fax machines would need to be located in a secure area where any transmitted data would be protected.    

SSA has no objection if the primary source wishes to include affiliated facilities to serve as sub-contractors to broaden the geographic coverage area, although any sub-contractors would be subject to the same rules, regulations, requirements and policies as the primary source. 

After a detailed review of this sources sought synopsis, please provide a response if you are/are not interested in the project.  If you are interested in the project, a capability statement should be forwarded summarizing your experience in providing the type of examination described and how your medical facilities and personnel meet the criteria listed above.   If you are not interested in the project, a brief explanation on why would be helpful to SSA.  

Capabilities statements should be sent to:

1.	Host various supplier catalogs under contract and provide access to open market products and services (e.g., using sniffer technology for pre-qualified supplier participants under USPS B2B agreements).
2.	Allow side-by-side comparison shopping (using a total cost approach).
3.	Allow punch outs to commercially available catalogs.
4.	Section 508 compliant (or an affirmative plan to achieve 508 compliance within a reasonable period).
5.	Proven technology (Deployed for at least 1 year in a production environment among established client base).
6.	Webbased thin client solution (no plug-ins, no cookies etc.).
7.	Allow cost effective integration with legacy systems.
8.	Detailed canned and ad-hoc reporting capabilities (including UNSPSC spend capture).

<DESC>Statement of Objectives Increment 3 Government Acceptance Testing Support 10 July 2006 1.0	Background The Army Program Executive Office (PEO) Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) Standard Procurement System (SPS) Joint Program Management Office (JPMO) is in the process of acquiring and fielding a commercially based application to support the automation of contracting offices through the Department of Defense (DoD). This program will continue in an evolutionary spiral development cycle for several years and will require the use of modern technologies to perform its mission. To meet mission requirements, the JPMO is introducing SPS Increment 3 which converts the application from a client-server architecture to a web-based environment. It is a component based, n-tier, open and scalable solution that improves performance, operat es on a variety of hardware platforms and supports large transaction volumes. The browser based user interface reduces client-side hardware and software requirements, increases accessibility and lowers the total cost of ownership. Increment 3 is interopera ble and it facilitates information sharing by all business functions within an organization and throughout the supply chain. It is standards based, open and thin. SPS Increment 3 supports asynchronous processing and has greatly improved data validation, er ror handling and rendering. It is, indeed, a technologically advanced application that will fully support its intended audience. 2.0	Scope The objective of this effort is to obtain support and assistance for the JPMO Government Test Facility (GTF) during the government validation and verification (GV&V) during the period 17 July to 15 September 2006 and potentially system acceptance testing ( SAT) of SPS Increment 3 during the period 13 November to 31 December 2006. The mission of the JPMO includes testing and government acceptance of all SPS initial or updated SPS products. It is expected that Increment 3 will be delivered for testing in July 2006. At that time, the JPMO plans to execute a distributed test plan that includes service provided test personnel. However, the JPMO anticipates that service test support will fall short of the overall requirement. In order for the government to thorough ly test the Increment 3 application, conduct a fair and impartial GV&V and SAT, as well as meet the required acceptance and subsequent deployment schedules, additional test support is an absolute necessity. Resources Needed by Week (partials may be considered) Week of 7/31/06 - 5 Week of 8/14/06 - 1 Week of 8/21/06 - 9 Week of 8/28/06 - 13 Week of 9/4/06 - 16 Week of 9/11/06 - 17 3.0	Applicable Documents All documents and training required by the contractor to perform the work outlined in this order will be provided by the government before or during execution of the tasks. 4.0	Program Objectives The GTF is a small, independent group of professionals that perform the integral testing mission for the government. During major test evolutions, such as SPS Increment 3 government validation and verification and acceptance testing, the GTF is supported a nd augmented by personnel identified by the services. The JPMO anticipates that service support will fall short of the total requirement. The government, however, must fully test the application to ensure a quality product is produced and accepted for depl oyment. The augmentation to the GTF staff with personnel that are either knowledgeable of SPS or the overall procurement process for this period is critical to the governments acceptance of the product. The upcoming Increment 3 test period will test and validate 6465 total joint requirements and regression test nearly 500 issues from previous testing efforts. The initial test and validation of requirements is expected to take 12 weeks (60 business days). The joint requirements will be tested utilizing an operational scenario approach. There are approximately 250 operat ional scenarios that must be completed to ensure each requirement is fully tested. For the regression test, each issue requires a significant amount of setup time in order to emulate the circumstances in place when the issue was initially discovered, docum ented and validated. The full test must be completed efficiently and on time to minimize the cost to the government, and to meet programmatic requirements. These additional support personnel will allow the government to provide its due diligence in the tes ting process and subsequent acceptance of the product.  The contractors objective is to provide a minimum of twenty-five (not to exceed thirty) qualified personnel that are knowledgeable of SPS operations or knowledgeable of the government procurement process, and are capable of being trained to utilize the In crement 3 application to assist the GTF during the GV&V and potentially during the SAT of the product during the period 17 July to 15 September 2006 and 13 November through 31 December 2006 respectively. 5.0	Management and Technical Constraints Contractor access to vendor proprietary data may be required. Proprietary information obtained under this acquisition will not be used for any purpose other than that for which it was intended. The contractor will be required to provide a plan that clearly  describes the contractors roles, responsibilities and strategies The contractor must have the capability to participate in frequent meetings with the JPMO staff located at the JPMO facility in Fairfax, VA, as well as with the PEO EIS and DOIM staff located in Ft. Belvoir, Woodbridge, VA. Skill Sets: 	Demonstrated experience with DoD Contract writing and the overall DoD Business process (requirements, contracts and payment) 	MS Windows and IT Savy 	Desired:  IV&V testing or other testing experience	 6.0	Contract Data Requirements In response to the governments statement of objectives, the contractor shall submit a proposal that details the personnel, product, schedule, deliverables and projected costs of each task to be performed under this acquisition. The contractor shall not be gin a task until the order has been awarded. Project accomplishments and results shall be documented in a monthly report that includes projected and actual hours on each contract effort. The contractor shall report financial data under this acquisition using a formal financial system that operates in accordance with accepted commercial accounting standards. It is preferred that this data be provided in electronic form. Reportable data will  include, but is not limited to, performance metrics and earned value or earned value-like system data. 7.0	Period of Performance The period of performance for this delivery order will be from award through 15 September and potentially through 31 December 2006 if determined to be required. 8.0	Place of Performance The work to be performed under this order will be conducted primarily in the SPS JPMO facility located at 4114 Legato Road, Fairfax, VA 22033. Work may also be performed at the contractors facility or at other government facilities as designated and appro ved by the Contracting Officers Representative (COR). Access to other government facilities required for completion of work under this order will be coordinated by the SPS JPMO. 9.0	Travel No travel is required under this order.

<DESC>REVISED SOURCES SOUGHT

The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) / Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) is continuing to explore an effort to implement a Chemical Management Services (CMS) program to support DLA customers throughout the Department of Defense.  It is anticipated that Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC) will be the first task order for implementation of a CMS program.  This initiative is designed to provide a strategic, performance-based approach where a Chemical Service provider supplies and manages chemicals and related services for individual site locations with the goal of improving lead-times, reducing costs, and increasing customer satisfaction while allowing the customer to focus on their core competencies.  

Sources are sought for a potential 5 year contract that will provide third party chemical management services support to DLA customers who desire these services.  The anticipated contract type is for services with potential for a 5 year option period.  It is anticipated the contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with multiple awardees.  The basic IDIQ awardees will become pre-qualified sources that can then compete for task orders (implementing CMS at individual base locations).  The prospective CMS provider(s) will act as the single point of contact for all chemical transactions to include hazardous material.  The following items may be included in a CMS program, but is not limited to only the following:  paints, welding equipment, sealants, adhesives, lubricants, and gases (Federal Supply Classes 6810  50, 7930, 8010, 8030, 8040, 9110, 9130, 9135, 9140, 9150 and 9160).  Number of NSNs/items included in a CMS program will be determined at the task order level.  However, approximately 600  800 NSNs may be covered under the initial OC-ALC task order with the possibility for additional NSNs after contract award.  The anticipated scope of services is as follows for the basic IDIQ contract however, individual site(s) may encompass all or only a portion of the following which will be identified when the site level statement of work is prepared:

Forecasting collaboration with OC-ALC  accurately predicting future requirements/demand patterns.
Procurement/purchasing  prospective CMS provider will be responsible for all actions related to the acquisition and delivery of specific chemical NSNs. 
Inventory management/storage/warehousing  the direction and control of activities with the purpose of getting the right inventory in the right place at the right time in the right quantity in the right form at the right cost.
Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health (ESOH) services (to include waste collection & possibly disposal)  to provide an effective, sound, environmentally safe occupational health management system.  It is intended to be used in conjunction with other pertinent procedures, regulations, manuals, and guidance documents that support environmentally sound management.
Data management  to include IT solutions suitable to the customer - providing business data such as material costs, service fees tracked by department, and operational data. 


SUMMARY

One of the elements to be gained from this sources sought is to gauge the industry for chemical management services capability and determine the socioeconomic status of the industry base for this type of initiative.  All respondents are requested to indicate their business size status under the proposed NAICS code (561210) and whether or not their company qualifies in any sub-category (i.e. 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB).  Offers should not be included and will not be accepted at this time.  This initiative is still in the initial phase of market research.  Please send your notice of interest to Diane Sadler, Acquisition Specialist, Email diane.sadler@dla.mil, no later than 9 August 2006.

It is anticipated this effort may move forward within the next 90 days.  In the event this initiative moves forward, a website will be available for updates to this CMS program at http://www.dscr.dla.mil/UserWeb/FAGA/index.html, under Specialized Support click on CMS.

<SUBJECT>B -- Study of aged non-human primates
<DESC>In accordance with FAR subpart 13.106(b)(1) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the Caribbean Primate Research Center in the amount of $60,000.00 to conduct a study on aged non-human primates greater than 15 years old in Sabana Seca, Puerto Rico. The purpose of the study is to establish a non-human primate model of West Nile Virus (WNV) encephalitis in aged- animals.  The data obtained from this study will determine whether this is an appropriate model to study WNV neuroinvasive disease and the important factors that regulate the pathogenesis of WNV. CDC believes that the Caribbean Primate Research Center is the only organization that can meet the requirements because Caribbean Primate Research Center is the only monkey colony that has the number and availability of monkeys over the age of 15 years old necessary for the study. Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their abilities to meet this requirement. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Please send your documentation to Ronnie Francis at the office identified above, by fax (770) 488-2688 or by e-mail to efi8@cdc.gov. Documentation should be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by CDC.

<SUBJECT>B -- Electron Beam Interaction in Variable Pressure mscanning Electron Microscopes
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Precision Engineering Division of the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with the Nanofab Laboratory of the University of Albany, Albany, New York 12203, for the acquisition of services to develop software to model the electron beam interaction in variable pressure mscanning electron microscopes for ultimately achieving accurate metrology with these instruments. Research and development services with respect to system design, modeling, and image analysis are required in support of this project.
 
*****Sole source determination is based on the facts that the activity of the Scanning Electron Microscope Laboratory of the Nanoscale Metrology group has moved into new territories, including the use of variable pressure scanning electron microscope (SEM). This microscope will be used as the platform for the NIST Reference dimensional metrology SEM. In order to accurately measure and certify as standards various integrated and nano-technology structures, accurate models must be used. A suitable model that rigorously adheres to the physics of the electron beam-sample material interaction allows for much better results at the nanoscale, where the excited volume is comparable or larger than the needed measurement resolution and accuracy. NIST has excellent high-vacuum modeling capability but lacks suitable low vacuum modeling solution. Low vacuum scanning electron microscopy is a leading technology for next generation critical dimension metrology on highly insulating materials and other difficult artifacts including photolithographic masks, resist samples, and low-k dielectrics. The operating principles, signal amplification, signal detection, and image interpretation are all distinctly different from conventional high vacuum microscopy and are not fully known yet. Furthermore, the interaction of primary and emitted electrons with gaseous molecules and ions make several additional contributions to the image formation.

<SUBJECT>R -- Resident Research Associateship Program
<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) in coordination with the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) has a requirement for the overall scientific and technological policy supervision and associated administrative functions for the successful conduct of a postdoctoral research associateship program.  Sole source negotiations will be held with the National Academy of Sciences  National Research Council (NAS-NRC).  ONR intends to affiliate with the existing National Academies Research Associateship Program (RAP) administered by the NAS-NRC.  That program relies heavily upon high-quality academic review panels that meet quarterly to evaluate postdoctoral research applicants.  These panels are drawn from among the U.S. scientific, medical and engineering communities.  The Academies close connection with this program gives the RAP a singular profile within the research community and thus tends to attract the most promising of applicants.  It is in this respect that the NAS is uniquely situated to offer and administer a high-quality postdoctoral program in the health sciences fields that is of particular interest to ONR and NMRC.  ONRs participation in an existing RAP ensures that the costs of selecting the best post-doctoral researchers will be less than paying for the establishment of a new postdoctoral research associateship program with the required high-quality academic review boards. In addition, NAS-NRC is the only contractor that can provide continuity of management for the postdoctoral associates that are already performing at NMRC and other NMRC laboratories through the RAP.  Contract period of performance is estimated to be three (3) years.  

Note 22 applies: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Information (RFI) - Design and implementation of a study or studies regarding the potential association of vaccine adverse events and human genetic variation
<DESC>Request for Information: Design and implementation of a study or studies regarding the potential association of vaccine adverse events and human genetic variation.
 
Background:

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Office of the Director, Office of the Chief Science Officer, Immunization Safety Office (ISO) is soliciting input from qualified scientists to identify the resources, parameters and elements of research protocols designed to identify potential associations between specific human immune response gene polymorphisms and the quality of response to vaccination (i.e. hypo- or hyper-response) or the development of particular adverse events following immunization.

The Human Genome Project has provided an unprecedented opportunity to define the genetic and environmental contributions to health and disease. The scientific progress from this project offers the opportunity to better understand the immunogenetic response to vaccination.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supports research related to the basic understanding of how human genetic variation may impact the immunologic response to vaccines and how this individual human genetic variation may affect both the quality of the immune response as well as potential risks for adverse events that may occur following immunization.  The focus of this research program will be to investigate the immunogenetics involved with specific serious adverse events following routine vaccinations or the immunogenetics involved with the failure to mount a normal immune response (i.e. hypo- or hyper-response to vaccination). Identifying individual genetic predisposition that strongly affect the risk for the development of a specific adverse event may allow for the eventual development of evidence-based guidelines for the screening and identification of susceptible children, adolescents and adults who are at risk for vaccine adverse events or vaccine failure.  This information might also be helpful for future vaccine development efforts aimed towards allowing people to be protected against the serious diseases that vaccines are intended to prevent.  

Characteristics of such a study that might maximize its research value may 
include: 

1)	Clear and in-depth delineation of the vaccine adverse event, or the development of hypo- or hyper-response to vaccination.

2)	Collection and storage of biological specimens including DNA, plasma and cells.

3)	Investigation of a broad array of clinical and laboratory information, to include the study of inflammatory pathways and direct antibody and cytolytic T cell responses 

4)	Collaboration with clinical networks covering a sufficiently large number of vaccinated subjects in order to identify sufficient numbers of participants with rare and serious adverse events following immunization, or hypo-response or hyper-response to vaccination.   

5)	Examination of a broad age range of subjects, in order to provide information on rare and serious adverse events, and hypo- or hyper-response to vaccination along a full spectrum of vaccinated people.  

6)	Examination of personal and family history as it pertains to vaccine response or other conditions that might influence vaccine response.

7)	Use of family-based recruitment where appropriate, to increase the power of genetic analyses and control for population stratification

8)	Access to a highly sophisticated data management system and data analysis capabilities


Accordingly, the CDC is soliciting input from the scientific community and the public to guide in developing such a study or studies.

PURPOSE:

This request for information seeks input on approaches to developing one or more studies to perform in-depth clinical investigations along with state-of-the-art genetic methodology that would be capable of studying the relationship between specific genetic polymorphisms and the development of adverse events following immunization or hypo- or hyper-response to vaccination. Input could include suggestions on optimal characteristics of such a study, such as some of the items described above; suggestions on which disease categories (ie rheumatologic; immunologic; neurologic; dermatologic) might be particularly amenable to study, based on current state of knowledge; and, characteristics of existing studies that might lend themselves to inclusion in such efforts.  Respondents are asked to comment on one or more of the issues listed above, but should not feel compelled to address all issues, nor should feel compelled to limit their responses to these categories.

INFORMATION REQUESTED:

1.	If appropriate funding were available to support studies of the relationship between specific genetic polymorphisms and the development of adverse events following immunization or hypo- or hyper-response to vaccination in children, adolescents or adults, please comment on how subjects with rare serious vaccine events or hypo and/or hyper-response to vaccination might best be identified and recruited for study (that is, through registries, medical records review, participant contact) and how often participants might contacted in any manner.
 
2.	Please describe the characteristics of a study that you view as most important to include in any such effort that might be undertaken.

3.	Please suggest the proper comparison group of non-affected individuals that might also be important to study, in order to best understand how genetic variation is linked to disease risk among the affected individuals.

4.	 Please identify the most relevant challenges to the identification of genetic factors influencing the risk of vaccine adverse events, including issues concerning the power to detect genetic effects (such as the incidence of the event following the vaccine and the ability to ascertain individuals with the event of interest), and state of knowledge surrounding relevant gene pathways to study.

5.	 Other information not specifically addressed by the comments above, but considered important and relevant to the development and implementation of a study of the genetic variations that may predispose children, adolescents or adults to certain vaccine adverse events or hypo- or hyper-response to vaccines, and could also be of considerable interest and value.

6.	 How this research can be an expansion of a current project that might be studying other vaccines, serious adverse events, other diseases, or other populations, etc. 

7.	If you were responsible for a study of vaccine adverse events, with the collection of stored DNA, please comment on how likely your study might be able to make its data accessible for use and analysis by other researchers, and the main obstacles for allowing such access.

8.	Please comment on what consent might be needed from your study participants, how it could be obtained, and how likely it might be that roughly 80% or more would consent.

9.	 Please comment on what additional data collection, primarily for risk factors other than those for which the study was established, might be necessary.

10.	 If you are aware of existing cohorts from which eligible study subjects might be identified, please comment on the age, race, and sex distribution of such existing groups of subjects and the proportion of these subjects likely to have stored DNA and other biologic materials such as serum, urine or other tissue available.

<SUBJECT>--Military Construction (MILCON) Centers of Standardization Nationwide Program Information
<DESC>MILITARY CONSTRUCTION (MILCON) CENTERS OF STANDARDIZATION NATIONWIDE PROGRAM INFORMATION:  This is an advance notice concerning the hosting of four regional Industry Day Forums in order to perform market research on Request(s) for Proposal(s) that ma y be issued in support of the Centers of Standardization Military Construction (MILCON) Program.   The Army is undertaking a significant shift in emphasis and prioritization with respect to resources and priorities.  This shift is driven by a reassessment of the strategic and operational environments and the Armys responsibilities to provide relevant a nd ready land power capabilities to commanders as part of the Joint Force now and in the future.  To realize the objectives of the emphasis shift, the Army is pursuing the most comprehensive transformation of its forces since the early years of World War I I.  The transformation is intended to move the legacy force into a new modular, more expeditionary and more lethal entity capable of quickly responding to our nations future threats.  A key component to this initiative is the standing up of Centers of Sta ndardization and standard designs for 41facility types.  USACE, in achieving the Armys objectives, is requesting market research information to allow responsible Districts to support the acquisition strategy for each facility type.  In order to accomplish this, USACE will conduct four regional Industry Day forums and will implement an internet-based market research questionnaire to gather and provide information regarding the Center of Standardization (CoS) MILCON needs.  This questio nnaire need only be completed one time for the entire MILCON COSProgram.  This information will be gathered according to the Armys Installation Management Agencys (IMA) four regions which are: Northeast Region (NER), Northwest Region (NWR), Southeast Reg ion (SER), and Southwest Region (SWR).  Please see the market research website for a map of the states covered by each of the IMAs regions.  Details about the market survey, including its internet address, will be forthcoming in the form of a Sources Soug ht on or about July 24th.  INFORMATION GATHERED RELATIVE TO THIS PROGRAM WILL PERMIT ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE METHOD(S) OF PROCUREMENT AND INPUT IS DESIRED FROM ALL INTERESTED PARTIES.  THIS INCLUDES CONTRACTORS, INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS, ASSOCIATIONS OR SOCIETIES.  This Construction  Program will consist of Mission Facilities for the Army (Barracks, Dining Facilities, Headquarters Buildings, Company Operations Facilities, Tactical Operations Facilities, Unit Storage, Ammo Storage, Paving/Roads & Parking, Aviation Operation Facilities,  Classrooms, Training Ranges) as well as community facilities for the Families (Child Development Centers, Chapels, Fitness Facilities, etc.) to support the Centers of Standardization Army MILCON requirements nationwide.  All buildings are to be considered  permanent and shall have a life span of approximately 25 years.   THIS PROGRAM IS NOT RESTRICTED AND IS OPEN TO BOTH LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION UNDER NAICS CODES 236  Construction of Buildings (236116, 117, 118, 210, 220); 237  Heavy and Civil  Engineering Construction (237110, 120, 130, 210); 238  Specialty Trade Contractors (238110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 190, 210, 220, 290, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, 390, 910, 990); 541  Professional and Technical Services (541310, 320, 330, 410, 490).

<SUBJECT>B -- Consulting and Expert data assembly
<DESC>Notice of intent to negotiate a sole source contract with Oregon State University, Department of Fisheries and Wildlife for NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service to provide consulting services and expert data assembly, analysis and reduction for assembling a sediment budget for streams of the John Day basin. Period of performance is from date of award until 9/30/2008.  Background and Objectives	The Center provides scientific and technical support to NMFS for the management, conservation, and wise-use of the Northwest regions marine and anadromous resources.  To address some of these needs the Conservation Biology Division formed the Mathematical Biology and Systems Monitoring Program to develop, in tandem with the existing Salmon Science Programs and Salmon Recovery Planning Teams, quantitative tools for assessing population and habitat status and recovery potential and progress.  One of the major projects undertaken by this program is the development of a large-scale comprehensive monitoring program to be implemented in three Columbia River sub-basins.  The primary objective of this project is the development of a rule set to guide the implementation of large-scale monitoring and evaluation programs across the Columbia River basin.  The project will accomplish this goal through the quantitative assessment of status and effectiveness monitoring and evaluation approaches.  The component of the overall project described herein specifically addresses the issue of developing quantitative methods to model the extent and impact of major sources of sediment supply to large interior Columbia River basin watersheds.
2.0	SERVICES REQUIRED

Support the development of a strong research effort to quantify the sources and impacts of natural and anthropogenic sediment supply to stream channels by key sediment delivery mechanisms within the John Day basin, Oregon.  In particular, this study will develop spatially explicit quantitative estimates of average annual sediment mobilization by landslides and gully erosion within the John Day basin.  The study will also assess the relationship between the estimated sediment delivery rate by landslides and gully erosion with both natural (e.g., geology and slope) and anthropogenic influences (e.g., land cover and roads).  This order consists of seven specific tasks.

2.1	Specific Technical Services

2.1.1.	Review existing geologic information and develop a detailed sampling design.  Begin with the Landslide Overview Map of the Conterminous United States (Radbruch-Hall et al., 1982, US Geological Survey Professional Paper 1183) as an initial hypothesis for spatial landslide frequency within the John Day basin.  Review existing geologic maps and reports to refine/modify this initial landscape classification.  Develop a stratified random sampling design based on the resulting landscape classification.

2.1.2.	Do a preliminary screening-level landslide inventory using recent digital orthophoto quadrangles (DOQs) and refine sampling design, if needed.  Using recent DOQs, do a quick landslide inventory for a sample of at least 50 6th-field HUCs (or fewer if many landslides are found) to assess the number and variability in spatial density (patchiness) of landslides that can readily be identified in the imagery and to evaluate whether the landscape classification scheme (sampling strata) correctly capture large-scale variability in landslide frequency.  Based on the results of the screening survey, estimate the target sample size and modify the sampling design as needed.  It is anticipated that the final sample for detailed analysis will include a minimum of 20 6th-field HUCs.

2.1.3.	Conduct detailed landslide inventory using a time series of aerial photo analysis.  Based on the resolution and spatial coverage of available aerial photographic imagery, select target dates (years) for detailed analysis.  The intent is to obtain imagery at 10-15 year intervals for the period 1950-2005, although it is anticipated that the dates and resolution of available imagery will vary among sites.  To the extent possible, stereographic imagery will be used to enhance identification of land surface features.  Landslide features will be digitized on-screen onto a recent DOQ basemap and classified by the land cover type in which they originate (forest, clearcut, other nonforest, road-related [within a 50-m buffer from road centerlines]).  Landslide features will also be classified by type to the extent that this information can be determined from the imagery.  At a minimum, linear channelized or channel-forming features (e.g., debris flows or gullies) will be distinguished from non-channelized features (e.g., planar failures or rotational slumps).

2.1.4.	Conduct field sampling to validate air photo identification and estimate landslide volumes.  Conduct field visits to a random sample of identified landslide features to confirm air photo interpretations and collect field measurements to estimate sediment volumes.  Depending upon the number and spatial distribution of landslides identified in the air photo analysis, at least 50 to 60 features will be targeted for sampling.  A clustered sampling strategy may be used to minimize travel time between field sites.  Field observations will include land surface slope, land cover type within which the failure occurred (forested, clearcut, naturally non-forested) and presence of roads in proximity (up- or down-slope) to landslide features.  In addition, field sample a set of locations where landslides are expected (by landform and landuse) to estimate misclassification rate of photo interpretation.

2.1.5.	Estimate sediment volume of mapped slides in inventoried sub-basins.  Develop regression equation to estimate landslide volume for all slides mapped from photos.  Use multivariate regression to estimate landslide volumes based on the relationship of field-measured volumes to photo-measured landslide areas and landscape characteristics (e.g., bedrock lithology, surface slope, land cover).

2.1.6.	Estimate magnitude of sediment supply from landslides and gully erosion throughout the John Day basin.  Based on landslide inventory for sampled sub-basins, modify landscape classification (landslide frequency map units) as appropriate.  Develop a GIS algorithm to extrapolate estimated sediment supply from landslides and gully erosion from the sampled sub-basins to the entire John Day basin.  Estimate sediment supply rates for each combination of landslide frequency map unit and land cover type.

2.1.7.	Prepare summary report.  Prepare a written report or manuscript summarizing the approach, methods, and results of the landslide sediment budget analysis.  The report shall present estimated sediment supply from both landslides and surface erosion in map and tabular form and shall discuss the relationship of sediment supply from both sources with both land cover and natural landscape attributes.
This requirement concerns an extension of existing work, so reflects considerable cost efficiencies through continuity of activities. Questions concerning proposed contract may be submitted to Melvin Fondue. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000

STATEMENT OF WORK

South Asia Regional Initiative for Energy (SARI/Energy) Phase II
Program Evaluation 

I.	Introduction:

USAIDs South Asia Initiative for Energy (SARI/Energy) is an eight country program that promotes energy security in the South Asian countries of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Begun in 2000, the SARI/Energy program focuses on approaches to meet South Asia's regional energy security needs through increased trade, investment and access to clean energy.   

The SARI/Energy Program was created in 2000 to encourage regional cooperation in energy development and trade in clean energy resources among South Asian countries. The program was developed jointly by USAID and the U.S. Department of State to improve regional stability and energy security. The lack of market-driven, commercial energy supplies in the region was identified as a fundamental constraint to increased energy security, economic growth and associated improvements in environmental quality, human health, and reduced emissions of greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector. Over the past five years the program has focused on building trust and confidence across borders, as well as advocacy for necessary reforms in the energy sector.  

The program is implemented through the following five partners 
1.	Nexant Inc. for technical assistance and training; 
2.	United States Energy Association for regional energy partnerships; 
3.	National Renewable Energy Laboratory for renewable energy; 
4.	Winrock International (Winrock) for community based small grants program and 
5.	U.S. Chamber of Commerce (USCoC) for private sector coalitions.

An evaluation of the Phase I SARI/E program was conducted in 2002 and the evaluation report is available with USAIDs SARI/E program office.  Based on the recommendations of the evaluation the program was extended to Phase II and Nexant was awarded the prime contract under RFP process in October 2003 for implementing the technical assistance and training components of the program for a total funding of approx. $15 million until Sept. 2006 and Winrock International was awarded the Grant in May 2003 based on the RFA process for implementation of small grants program.  USCoC continued its performance under cooperative agreement signed during April 2001.  

In Phase II there was a shift in the theme -- Phase I of SARI/E program focused on building confidence and Phase II focus on building commitments across borders that will enhance energy cooperation and potential trade and also a shift from regional interconnection to regional energy security.  

II.	Purpose of Evaluation:

The purpose of this evaluation is to assess the appropriateness of the implementation strategy in reaching the programs objectives; the cost-effectiveness and impact of activities implemented by Nexant, Winrock and USCoC in each of the SARI/Energy countries  (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, India, Sri Lanka and Maldives) how far implementing partners have succeeded in achieving the shift of building confidence in Phase I to building commitments across borders that will enhance energy cooperation and potential trade in Phase II.

The principle objectives of SARI/Energy Phase II are listed below; (the contractor should also review the USAIDs contract with Nexant, USCoC cooperative agreement and Winrock grants agreement for additional detail to conduct the evaluation.)

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded.

Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the National Stock Number, Nomenclature, Part Number and Unit Price.   NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is N2806060066 and is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).     This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-07 dated 02/02/2006.     This acquisition is conducted under Full and Open competition. The North American Standard Industrial Classification System code is 541611 and the small business size standard is $6.5million. The National Park Service Fee Program Office in Washington DC is responsible for providing oversight and accountability of all fee collection programs in the NPS.  The Fee Program Office in coordination with the NPS Information Technology Office is responsible for fee collection information systems and applications including the implementation of a service wide Point of Sale Cash Register System.  Circular No. A-130 provides uniform government-wide information resources management policies as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35. This Transmittal Memorandum contains updated guidance on the "Security of Federal Automated Information Systems," Appendix III and makes minor technical revisions to the Circular to reflect the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-13). The Circular is reprinted in its entirety for convenience.  OMB Circular A-127, Financial Management Systems, section 71, requires Management to maintain all documentation (software, system operations, user manuals, operating procedures, etc) as current and make them readily available for examination.  Part of the task in preparing this document is to take existing work processes and prepare a manageable document that can be updated regularly.  The Information Technology (IT) Management Reform Act of 1996 (i.e., ITMRA or the Clinger-Cohen Act), which took effect August 8, 1996, abolished the Brooks Act (it repealed Section 111 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 759)). The Brooks Act made the General Services Administration (GSA) the central authority for procurement of automatic data processing (ADP) resources. The Federal Information Resources Management Regulation (FIRMR) was issued to implement the Brooks act and established a process that required Federal agencies to obtain a Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA) from GSA to acquire ADP, initially, and telecommunications (TC) resources. Passage of the ITMRA is causing a major paradigm shift in the process for acquiring and managing IT. The task of understanding the objectives of ITMRA and establishing a program or process to manage IT in a Federal agency is a major undertaking.  PROJECT OVERVIEW POSS is being created to create a standardized, yet flexible, Service-wide Fee Collection Point-of-Sale System (POSS) enabling effective and efficient collection, accounting, reporting, and management of National Park Service fee revenues.  The POSS will allow parks to collect fees from visitors and deposit Recreation Fee Revenue into the Treasury and the Service's financial systems.   This will include a set of standardized equipment and a software system options that will meet the various fee structures and collection needs.  Further, the Service-wide POSS will provide a flexible, open-architecture, long-term platform, which allows for the implementation of new, innovative fee-collection technologies, including automated fee machines, and internet pass sales.  A POSS support Department of the Interior (DOI) Strategic Goals and the President's Management Agenda, and has been mandated by Public Law 108-447 (the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (REA) in December 2004, which provides the authority to establish, modify, charge, and collect recreation fees has been extended and enhanced for ten years).  The National Park Service (NPS) Recreation Fee Program, within the Department of Interior (DOI), is coordinating the project and is the primary sponsor.  A POSS Project Charter and Integrated Project Team have been composed to support and complete the vision of the project defined in the project charter.     The NPS collected over $160M in FY2005 in Recreation Fee Revenues at 270 parks.  Of the 270, 216 collected fees through a combination of Entrance, Use, Transportation, 1a2g (Living History) or Reservation fees and 54 collected fees through passport sales only.  A POSS will capture sale transaction details at the point of sale and transfer the data to a software program.   A Service-wide contract will be established to provide integration, interoperability, and standardization that allows for Service-wide support, consistent configuration, installation, upgrades, maintenance, troubleshooting, and implementation of new technologies, and provide adequate support, training, and capture of data to be forwarded on to the regional and Service-wide managers.  Upon implementation of the POSS project, parks will have: 1.  A set of Service-wide specifications, contract vehicle, and contracting support that will allow parks to easily procure and install POS units that connect to a Service-wide database, based on park needs and budget. 2.  POS units that will allow parks to: a)	Rapidly and efficiently conduct transactions with visitors to the park. b)	Accept and process cash, check, credit-card, NPS pass, pre-authorized debit (PAD), vouchers, or interagency pass payments. c)	Efficiently deposit fee revenues into Treasury and provide transaction data nightly for the timely upload to the Service's financial systems. d)	Capture transaction details and statistical metrics. e)	Effortlessly and accurately report fee revenues and statistical metrics into a Service-wide database for analysis. f)	Manually report and deposit fee revenues from external systems (e.g. automated fee machines, iron ranger or canister, and NRRS collections) or from parks that do not have the fee revenue to justify an automated POS. g)	Support multiple types of fee collection (e.g. entrance, campground, tour, transportation, 1a2g). h)	Implement and interface innovative fee collection technologies in the future, including high speed internet authorization ability, collection of pass data, hand held devices, automated gates/pass lanes, security systems, RFID chips, collection of social science/demographics etc. i)	Support fee collection activities with varying levels of available infrastructure (network access, data transfer capabilities, reliable electrical power). j)	Accurately maintain inventory of serialized products for sale, including NPS Park Passes and interagency passes. 3. Centralized support for all aspects of the installation and operations of the Service-wide POSS Upon implementation of this project, the WASO Recreation Fee Program Office, Regional Fee Managers, and Park Superintendents and Fee Program Managers will have: a)	Service-wide standards for fee revenue collection and reporting. b)	Immediate and ready access to a current and complete data warehouse of fee revenue and demographic data for analysis and reporting. c)	Ability to accurately and efficiently generate recurring and ad hoc financial reports. Upon implementation of this project, visitors to the parks will have: a)	A smooth, fast, efficient transaction at the fee collection station, regardless of method of payment. b)	The ability to pay park fees by cash, check, credit card, NPS park pass, pre-authorized debit (PAD), vouchers, or interagency pass. c)	The ability to purchase NPS park passes and interagency park passes. Phase One: Planning Activities of POSS Project The POSS project was approved by the NPS Information Technology Investment Council (ITIC) to commence planning activities in April 2006, and to move from the Pre-Select to the Select phase in the NPS Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) process.  Planning deliverables will culminate in the following: a)	Approval by the ITIC to move from the Select to the Control phase of the investment. b)	Issuance of the RFP for the POSS hardware, software, and support. c)	Selection of the vendor for contract award and system implementation. d)	Based on performance, ITIC approval, and need this contract may be extended into implementation of the awarded contract.  This SOW provides the project management resources to the project to complete the planning activities required by the project, the Integrated Project Team, the NPS CPIC process for major IT investments, the release of the Request for Proposal, the vendor selection, and the award of the contract for the POSS.   Phase Two: Implementation Phase of POSS Project The scope of the implementation phase will be progressively refined during the planning phase of the project, and the project charter will be modified to include this refinement before initiation of any implementation activities.  Project stakeholders will have an opportunity to comment on and validate the modified scope before implementation begins.  Implementation deliverables will culminate in the following: 1.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation, REQ1017789, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-10.  The acquisition is set-aside for Woman-own Business.  The associated NAICS code is 541618 and small business size standard is $6.5 Millions.  BACKGROUND: Quality Assurance as defined by the International Conference on Harmonizations (ICH) Guidance for Industry E6 Good Clinical Practice (GCP): Consolidated Guidance is: All those planned and systematic actions that are established to ensure that the (clinical) trial is performed and the data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirement(s). FDA has developed a Quality Assurance Program for FDA-sponsored human subject research.  It has developed procedures for implementing an agency-wide assurance program to oversee the quality of FDA-sponsored research involving human subjects.  This program is designed to monitor and provide feedback to the Commissioner and agency managers on adherence to applicable regulations and acceptable standards for the conduct of human subject research.  The underlying objective of the program is to assure the quality and integrity of human subject research and to ensure that human subjects of FDA-sponsored research are protected. FDA-sponsored human research falls under the jurisdiction of 45 CFR 46.  These regulations govern all federally funded human subject research. FDA-sponsored research that is within the scope of the agency quality assurance program includes: Research sponsored, funded or supported by FDA. Research conducted by or under the direction of any employee or agent of FDA in connection with his or her official responsibilities. Research conducted by or under the direction of any employee or agent of FDA using any property or facility of FDA. Research involving the use of FDAs non-public information to identify or contact human research subjects or prospective subjects. Good Clinical Practice Guidelines dictate that studies involving human subjects require oversight by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) and periodic monitoring by qualified individuals. CFSAN personnel who are conducting (as Principle Investigators) or collaborating on studies involving human subjects obtain approval and have oversight of their study(s) from the FDAs Research Involving Human Subjects Committee (RIHSC). Each Center at FDA is required to develop and implement a Quality Assurance Program for monitoring of ongoing studies and recordkeeping. Purpose: The purpose of the monitoring of studies involving human subjects is to verify that:  the rights and well-being of human subjects are protected; the reported trial/study/focus group/survey data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; and the conduct of the trial is in compliance with currently approved protocol/amendment(s) with Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. - Personnel Requirements- The contract must provide trained-personnel with scientific and clinical knowledge who have monitored and audited research studies involving human subjects. Personnel shall be thoroughly familiar with such areas as clinical trial design, human subject protection issues as they relate to research studies, essential elements of informed consent, etc.   Personnel need to have had experience auditing studies involving human subjects both clinical studies and social science studies.  They must also be familiar with assessing QA of contractors who are conducting studies for principle investigator(s). Scope of Work: The contractor shall: Provide personnel to assist CFSAN Human Subject Protection Lead -in determining if its quality assurance research program has adequate procedures in place. Assess CFSANs current QA program related to studies involving human subjects including monitoring and recordkeeping before, during and after completion of studies involving human subjects. Provide recommendations for modifications and further development of this program.  At any given time, there are a few clinical trials being conducted by CFSAN personnel. But most of the studies conducted by CFSAN employees utilize outside contractors to develop and to facilitate the actual focus groups, surveys, etc. Therefore QA procedures are needed for both CFSAN internal study activities and for collaborating with outside contractors/institutions. Period of Performance:  August 14, 2006 to August 13, 2007.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. *** This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-08. ***The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334519. The associated Standards Industrial Classification Code (SIC) for this procurement is 6640 and the small business size is 500 employees.

All interested parties may submit a quote.  ***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for the purchase of an x-y positioner submitted on a fixed price basis.  

The Machine Tool Metrology group of MMD at NIST has a need for an x-y positioning device to move a camera and lens vision system above a workpiece to be measured.  The field of view of the existing camera, the size of the workpieces, and the precision of the features on the workpieces all dictate high accuracy and resolution over a range of motion.  The camera will image through an aperture in the center of the positioning stages.  The best way to do this within size constraints is with two cross-stacked linear stages, each side-driven by a combination of DC motor actuator (for long motion) and a piezoelectric actuator (for fine motion).

LINE ITEM 0001:  X-Y Positioning Device, Quantity one (1) each, in accordance with the following specifications.

Requirements 
1.  Linear stages:
Linear stages should be stackable in an x,y configuration
Maximum x-y dimensions of stages is 100 x 100mm.
Minimum 30mm diameter center aperture on each stage
Normal load capacity of at least 5kg
Side driven

2.  Technical specifications for
Positioning (for each axis):
Total range of travel					25mm
Fine travel range (piezo)				45um
Minimum incremental motion			5nm
Unidirectional repeatability				100nm
Backlash						2um
Straightness (over full travel)				300nm
Each DC motor actuator and piezoelectric actuator should be controlled by a stand-alone, external (i.e. NOT a PC board) controller that connects to a PC via a RS-232 or USB interface, allows coordination of the four actuators (two DC actuators and two piezoelectric actuators), and allows programming of contoured motion.  Since coordinated motion between the DC motor and the piezo actuator on both axes is vital, purchase of a single, integrated device is deemed necessary.

Single axis nano positioning stage specifications

Frictionless precision flexure guiding system
Piezo actuator
direct metrology with capacitive sensors
closed- loop travel to 12 um
closed-loop resolution 0.05 nm
closed-loop linearity 0.03%
full-range repeatability 1 nm
stiffness 45N/um
push/pull force capacity 100/20 N
Max. normal load (vertical/horizontal) 100/20 N
Lateral force limit 30 N
Operating temperature -20 to 80 degrees C
Body material stainless steel
Overall size approximately 30 mm by 15 mm by 44 mm

Closed loop controller with RS232 interface for single axis nano position stage.

Stand alone bench top controller and amplifier
Close servo loop using capacitive sensors on stage to 0.05 nm resolution
20 bit digital-to-analog and digital-to-analog converters
Voltage range of -20 to 120 volts to drive piezo
High speed RS232 communications that performs up to 300 highly deterministic read or write operations per second
RS232 interface can be networked for linking up to four controllers together.
Controller capabilities include instruction command set for automated positioning stage.
LabVIEW drivers are provided.
DELIVERY SHALL BE FOB DESTINATION.  Delivery is required within 60 days after receipt of Order. *** The Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  *** Award shall be made to the offeror whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price.  Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price.  *** Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Offerors shall include the sales literature or other product literature that clearly documents that the offered product meets or exceeds the specifications stated above.  Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided in accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and/or information provided by NIST and its affiliates.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation  for services procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service located in Honolulu, Hawaii in to aquire  the following services;  1.) controlled testing of gear changes to reduce sea turtle bycatch in longline fisheries with high catchrates for leatherback turtles.

Project Background: Incidental capture of sea turtles by pelagic longlines through both hooking and entanglement is a threat to the survival of sea turtle populations throughout the world. There are a number of longline fishing characteristics that can affect turtle bycatch such as hook shape and size, the depth, structure, and material composition of the fishing line and other parts of the gear, and the time of initiating and completing fishing operations.  Turtles generally get caught by longlines when trying to consume bait on hooks, or as they become entangled in suspended fishing lines, especially when the lines are slack, flexible, and set near the sea surface.  To assist the recovery of sea turtle populations, it is NOAAs goal to test alternate fishing methods that may reduce incidental turtle hooking and entanglement, so that these methods may be promoted in commercial fisheries around the world.  

Throughout the last decade there has been extensive longline testing of various sizes of circle hooks as an alternative to the more commonly used J-shaped hooks and so-called tuna hooks (shaped like a bent J).  Results from studies in the U.S.A.s Atlantic and Pacific longline fisheries for swordfish have indicated that circle hooks of size 18/0 (> 4.9 cm minimum width) reduced the bycatch of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in comparison with J hooks of size 9/0 (3.8-3.9 cm minimum width).  Within some longline fisheries with high leatherback catch rates, the proportion of the bycatch that is entangled is sometimes higher for leatherbacks than for hard shell sea turtles. There has been little research to develop methods of reducing entanglement of sea turtles in longline gear.  Leatherbacks tend to be caught on longlines during the night, and feed predominantly on bioluminescent jelly organisms such as cnidarians.  They may be attracted to light lures that are attached to the gear.  Considerable research has been conducted on the visual abilities of target fish species and sea turtles.  Some of this research suggests that alternatives to the light lures used in some fisheries may reduce leatherback bycatch.  Leatherback turtles also tend to be caught more frequently on hooks located closest to floats (which also tend to be the shallowest hooks).  Some research suggests that lines set deeper, or further from floats, or that more rigid lines may catch fewer leatherback turtles.  Hypotheses have been advanced that entanglement could be reduced by reducing the number of surface floats, and augmenting the suspension of the main line in other fashions, such as with midwater floats or by inverting the normal arrangement of the gear so that the main line is deployed below the hooks.    

General Requirements for an Offer: NOAA is seeking contractors to conduct a controlled comparison between standard fishing gear (the control) and an alternative fishing gear (the treatment) that is hypothesized or has been demonstrated to reduce leatherback turtle bycatch.  Examples that could be proposed include (but are not limited to): 1) an offer to test size 18/0 circle hook versus some other standard hook currently in use; 2) an offer to test an alternate type of light lure versus the standard type; or 3) an offer to test more rigid lines, or deeper lines, or lines using fewer floats versus the standard configuration.   Most importantly, offers must indicate an ability to obtain and use fishing vessel services and to conduct controlled scientific testing as well as to observe, record and report the results; all for the offered price.  Offers must indicate the capability of conducting gear trials in a fishery where fishing regulations allow both the alternative and standard gear to be used.  The fishery proposed for gear trials must also have a reasonable expectation (e.g. past average rate) of turtle bycatch frequent enough to result in trial bycatch of at least 10 observed leatherback turtles (combined bycatch by the standard and alternative gear).  Please provide a price quote for one year, and for an option to contract a 50% addition to the first years work (resulting in an expectation of at least 5 more observed leatherbacks in the gear trials).   Most fisheries that meet these regulation and bycatch frequency requirements and that can provide the solicited testing at a competitive price, are expected to operate outside of the U.S.A.  Offers must indicate experience and ability to work in the proposed fishery, and must indicate that the vessels and gears to be used are permitted under the regulations governing the proposed fishery.

If there are no qualified offers that meet these general requirements specifically for leatherback turtles, offers that address a combination of (or a single) turtle species in an otherwise qualified proposal will be considered.

Proposed gear alterations that appear to have a reasonable possibility of increasing sea turtle mortality will be rejected.  For example, proposed gear alterations that would increase the numbers of turtles being caught or entangled in branch lines too short for the turtle to reach the surface will be rejected even if they are anticipated to reduce the total number of turtles caught.

Provide a description of the standard fishing gear and fishing operations, and what is known or expected about the rate of turtle bycatch in the fishery in which you propose to conduct the gear trials.   
Format of Bids:  An offer should be made for testing a specific total quantity of fishing gear comprised of equal amounts of standard (control) versus alternative (treatment) fishing effort  measured in hooks (note the alternative gear may not be a different hook, but the bid must be for a specific contracted quantity of fishing effort specified in hooks).  This should be the amount of effort expected to result in the observed bycatch of at least 10 leatherback turtles over a one-year contract.  Another offer should be made for an option for testing an additional quantity of effort equal to half of the original amount, i.e.:

Contract:
For gear trials using fishing effort of ___________hooks in 1 year:  $______________
Resulting in an estimated bycatch of _____ (give number) of leatherback turtles (minimum = 10)

Option: 
For gear trials using fishing effort of ___________additional hooks $______________
Resulting in an estimated bycatch of _____ (give number) of leatherback turtles (minimum = 5)

NOAA may or may not opt to continue the work beyond one year.  Please provide the basis for estimating the number of turtle interactions that would result from testing the proposed amount of fishing gear.  The realized number of turtle interactions will be beyond human control, and cannot be a binding factor in the contract.  

NOAA may respond with an offer to contract only a fraction of the proposed amount of testing, subject to availability of funding.  

NOAA is only interested in testing alternate gears that are likely to result in continued economic viability of ongoing fishing operations. Contractors may need to plan on using vessels that will sell their fish catch as usual (fishing vessels) or that cover much of their operating costs through some other source.  The contract award may not be sufficient for the contractor to cover a significant fraction of vessel operating costs.  All such considerations and vessel incentives are the responsibility of the contractor, who should take them into account when developing an offer.  In deciding upon a bid, the contractor should consider the possibility that altered fishing gear may unintentionally reduce target species catch rates, and shall not expect NOAA fisheries to provide additional funding for this contingency.

Specific tasks to be completed by the contractor : The contractor will conduct sea trials of alternate fishing gear in comparison with the commonly used standard gear.  The alternate and standard gear will be tested in alternation in an unbiased (systematically staggered, and reordered), fashion along a daily longline set or on alternate days at the same general time of day and location.  Only paired testing will count towards the contracted amount of fishing effort for payment.  The contractor will observe, record, and conduct a simple summation of catch results that will contrast the catch (hooking and entanglement) of turtles and of fish between the equal amounts of alternative (treatment) and standard (control) fishing gear tested.  The contractor will seek to remove fishing gear and release captured turtles as much as possible within the constraints of the fishery, and in as close as possible a manner to that described in NOAA guidelines for sea turtle handing and release.  The recommended equipment for handling and release of sea turtles will be provided by NOAA.  The contractor will observe, record, and report the rate of hook ingestion or more superficial internal or external hooking or entanglement of each turtle, as well the anatomical location of gear-inflicted injury, and the turtle condition upon release.  The amount of fishing gear that remained on each released turtle and the degree to which each turtle remains entangled upon release will be also be observed and recorded.

The trial fishing operations will otherwise be carried out in the normal manner as the rest of the commercial fishery in the proposed locale.  All research fishing operations will be recorded by a scientific observer provided by the contractor, who will observe and report the quantity and general protocol for gear used on each set, including data on variables which may affect catch rates, such as the time and duration of the set, the weather, and the sea state.  

Deliverables: A progress report simply quantifying the fraction of work completed (fishing effort observed and recorded) and the treatment and control turtle bycatch rates will be provided by the contractor at the time of the second invoice.  A draft final report summarizing all experimental results and providing the complete data set should be provided to NOAA for review one month before the final invoice.  Any requests for revision of the final report will be returned to the contractor within two weeks of receipt of the draft final report. The period of performance is 9/2006 to 9/2007.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for service being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service located in Honolulu, Hawaii intends to acquire service for marine science education program to under-served youth in San Diego, Ca.
Objective: To help satisfy gaols of NOAA Environmental literacy, Outreach and Education: a NOAA Cross-Cutting Priority:
We will establish an environmental literacy program to educate present and
future generations about the changing Earth and its processes, to inspire our nations
youth to pursue scientific careers, and to improve the publics understanding and
appreciation of NOAAs missions. This program will improve the publics understanding
of the natural environment and human response to natural hazards,
will assist state and local natural resources managers, and will ensure that decision
makers have access to, and the knowledge to use, the information they need to
reduce significant human impacts on the environment and to respond to storm
warnings and environmental change.
 New Priorities for the 21st Century: NOAAs Strategic Vision, 2003

Project need: The work involved in meeting the NOAA goals would integrate NOAA mandated science objectives into a unique educational program that builds environmental literacy, promotes students of color in the fields of environmental and ocean science, and engenders an ethic of marine stewardship.  The work must engage underrepresented high school students through direct participation in NOAA research, as well as elementary and middle school students who should learn about NOAA science through interactions with the high school students and their educators. The ideal location for this work is in San Diego, California.  Period of Performance: August 5  - November 1, 2006


Project Needs:
The work should involve two components: educational experiences in the San Diego, California area (Phase 1) and encouragement of students to pursue field of marine science through community participation (Phase 2).

Phase 1: The work must provide several weeks of study through an after-school and weekend program in marine science and ecology in the San Diego area.  The science curriculum should focus on physical, biological and chemical properties of the ocean. Laboratory and field activities will be included. The program should host guest lecturers from NOAA offices. 


Phase 2: In order to ensure lasting outcomes, a series of supports should be developed to allow the students to continue on a path in the ocean sciences.  After completion of phase 1, the students should present their research findings to community members in a Report to the Community. Throughout the following year, each student should participate in a scientific conference. Students should also participate in job shadows, internships, a science seminar series, and additional career exploration. Ideally, some of these job shadow experiences could be conducted at NOAA facilities. Follow-up with students will continue throughout their high school experience.   

Specifically, we seek an organization that can achieve the following:

1) Engage students in K-12 in NOAA Science. Examples could include, but are not limited to the following activities:
	High school students could create a scientific user forum to be hosted on the San Diego Natural History Museum website. This would enable the students and scientists to communicate the research and experience to elementary and middle schools and the broader public. The blog allows a dialogue, creating a distance learning opportunity.
	High school students from the program could become mentors to middle school youth in San Diego. 
	To integrate NOAA science into California standards-based lesson plans that will reach low-income fifth grade students each year. 

2) Improve environmental literacy by:
	Engaging students interest in the coastal and ocean science.
	Developing students laboratory and field research skills.   
	Creating collaborations between informal and formal education communities to strengthen interest and participation in the ocean sciences in underserved students.
	Providing opportunities for underrepresented youth to participate in, and make a meaningful contribution to, authentic field-based NOAA research.
	Promote careers in environmental sciences to diverse populations of students.
	Create awareness of how individuals can take responsibility for the health of their natural resources through the development of resource management plans, participation in fisheries and other studies, and service learning opportunities.
	Disseminate findings that reflect SFOSs scientific and educational advances.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for service being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service located in Seattle, Washington intends to acquire services to provide summarize science on riparian buffer effectiveness in agricultural lands.

Background and Objective  
	The Center provides scientific and technical support to NOAA Fisheries for the management, conservation, and wise use of the Northwest regions marine and anadromous resources. 
	The objective of this work is to summarize existing science on riparian buffer effectiveness in agricultural lands. The purpose of this synthesis is to guide NOAA staff in evaluating the effectiveness of voluntary riparian conservation efforts on agricultural lands, specific to the interior Columbia River basin. Currently NOAA has no comprehensive summary of buffer effectiveness in non-forest lands and has limited ability to evaluate the salmon recovery potential of small, intensively managed riparian buffers. NOAA staff needs a comprehensive analysis of buffer management scenarios in order to rapidly evaluate the adequacy of multiple proposals. Such a reference is intended to help streamline the review process and economize staff time in both the Regional Office and Science Center.

 	Services Required 

	The contractor will work closely with National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)  scientists to review effectiveness of agricultural buffers (various widths and vegetation types) for conservation of ecological functions in streams (shading, sediment filtration, nutrient filtration, and pesticide filtration). The review will focus on documenting levels of ecosystem function that can be achieved using buffers typical of the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), comparing to two reference points  no buffer (the common current condition) and natural vegetation (a recovery planning reference point). Where possible, meta-analysis of published data should be included in the summaries of buffer effectiveness.


Overall goal: Report summarizing effectiveness of agricultural buffers for conservation of ecological functions in streams, including comparison to two reference points (no buffer and natural vegetation) and meta-analysis of published data. 

 Report is to include the following sets of buffer conditions and response variables.

Buffer conditions
	Buffer type  grass, shrubs, trees
	Buffer width  include no buffer and natural as end members
	Stream type  incised channels and non-incised channels
	Soil attributes  porosity and clay content

Response variables
	Temperature/shade
	Sediment filtration
	Nutrient filtration
	Insecticide and herbicide filtration
o	Group these by crop class? (row crop, orchard, small grains, other)

  Copies of all articles, reports and manuscripts cited in the report or gathered as part of this contract shall be provided when the report is delivered. Copies shall be double-sided.

  An electronic database of all articles, reports and manuscripts cited in the report or gathered as part of this contract shall be provided when the report is delivered. Database shall be in a format suitable for importing into the current version of Endnote bibliographic software, and shall include abstracts when readily available.

  The project PI shall be in regular contact (at least once a month) with the NWFSCs POC over the course of the project and apprise the POC of progress to date and of any unanticipated difficulties in obtaining the deliverables, or of any needs to change the scope of the deliverables.

Deliverables may be modified in consultation with NWFSC point of contact.

 
Period of Performance Deliverables are due by February 15th, 2006.

e.	Facility Concerns:  The theater is old and may require unknown specifications; therefore a site survey will be required by the contractor before a proposal can be submitted to ensure accuracy of the proposal.
f.	Cabling/Termination:  All control, video, and composite cabling will run from the projector into the ceiling and across the ceiling to the backstage right control panel.  Any visible cabling will be run through conduit.  For audio/video source connection to the control unit, a wall plate shall be installed directly below center stage on the front skirt.  The customer will be able to connect into the wall plate with all video/audio components.  From the wall plate, cabling will be run under the stage to the control panel or audio rack as needed.  Three XLR inputs will be needed in the wall plate along with a video input and composite input.
g.	Onsite Integration:  The contractor must ensure proper equipment function and connection capabilities via test for proper signal flow and custom control by the user. Upon completion of the entire system with final tests and adjustments for optimum equipment performance, the contractor shall provide training and documentation to primary operators and maintainers for daily use.

<DESC>*****This information is in addition to information provided in previous announcements for this requirement.******

Some general questions were received in regards to the Governments needs and how we plan on using the equipment.  The following provides more information on how the Government intends to use the equipment:

The unit will be used in a non-production facility.  High speed scanning is not high priority.  The material systems (specimens) to be analyzed include the full spectrum.  We perform basic failure analysis and research on all aircraft materials.  This includes Ti, Al, Fe alloys, super alloys, ceramics, and composites to name a few.  In essence, we want a system that can analyze all types of materials with minimum reconfiguration between specimens.  The system will not have a dedicated technician to run the equipment.  The Navy is interested in a unit that is easily operated.  
 
    The specimen geometry may be flat or curved such as a turbine blade.  We want to identify small imperfections that may be on a curved sections of a turbine with micro diffraction.  Therefore it is required that rough and irregular shaped samples are to be analyzed.
 
     XRD new system Training includes both software and hardware.  Training includes hands on training of the purchased unit at NAVAIR for familiarization purposes.   Advanced training on the software packages may be performed at either NAVAIR Pax River or the vendor site if within the United States.  It is expected that the vendor training include familiarization with the software packages supplied with the unit.  The hardware training/ familiarization should be performed at NAVAIR.  The duration of the training will be determined and highlighted by the vendor in the proposal.
 
    Reference Standard/s will be supplied to NAVAIR if required for any of the software analysis packages.  NAVAIR is requesting both quantitative and qualitative analysis capabilities for this unit.  Some manufactures may supply a standard reference that is periodically run on the equipment to determine beam performance.  If the vendor can perform these tasks without a standard, then it is not required.
 
    NAVAIR is not directing the kind/type of robust advanced quantitative analysis package.  
 
    The stage requirements may include tilting if needed for analyzing rough irregular shaped specimens.  The pinning requirement is to analyzed the irregulars shaped specimens.  The +/- 50mm Z direction requirement may be removed as a specific requirement.
 
    The location or the type of the collimator kit for this unit is not specified.

In addition to this general information, the following is also provided:

Item 10, (Cu absorber for CU- and Mo- radiation) is deleted.

In regards to Item 14, (Cu secondary monochromator for operation with Theta/Theta or Theta 2 Theta) we want a monochromator/s for analysis during micro diffraction as well as general diffraction applications.  This includes examining unknown specimens approximately 1cm by 1cm that may include Fe.  If the vendor has a technology that can replace a monochromater with a different device that exhibits similar or better characteristics of a monochromator, the government will consider the option. Otherwise, as a minimum we should have monochromator/s for a point detector and 1D detector.

In regards to Item 11a, a computer controlled stage is required.

Item 11c (minimum displacement of +/- 50 mm in Z direction is deleted.

The response date is still April 19th at 1400 EST.  The estimated award date is the middle of May.  If faxing your proposal, please call to ensure that your fax was received.mployment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans
