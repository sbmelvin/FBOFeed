<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to correct the North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) for: Solicitation: 13SSC-O-02-38, entitled Sources Sought Synopsis. A detailed review and analysis of the subject work-scope reveals that while engineering services remains a significant element of the work-scope, the preponderance of the work-scope focuses on Research & Development and Test, therefore necessitating this change in the NAICS Code.

ADAPTIVE AND REFLECTIVE MIDDLEWARE SYSTEMS (ARMS),
SOL BAA 02-24, DUE:  10/31/02; POC:  DR. DOUGLAS C. SCHMIDT, DARPA/IXO; FAX: (703) 522-7161

PROGRAM SCOPE

The objective of the ARMS program is to create technologies and tools that will dramatically simplify distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) middleware development, optimization, validation, and DoD combat systems. The middleware technologies and tools created in the ARMS program will focus on the challenging problems and risks associated with the development of a Total Ship Computing Environment (TSCE) in the DD(X) Future Surface Combatant Family of Ships.  The TSCE will be a fully integrated open system computing and information architecture that executes all tasks and mission applications optimized at the platform level, rather than the sub-system level, thus breaking down the traditional C4ISR, Combat Systems, and Ship Control System boundaries.  ARMS technologies and tools will allow researchers and DD(X) system integrators to develop and evolve complex DRE combat systems assuredly, adaptively, and affordably by:
?	Supporting dynamic allocation and migration of DRE applications with their associated security level across a wide array of general-purpose computing resources to maximize survivability and mission availability in the face of equipment failure, battle damage, software failures, and information warfare attacks 
?	Standardizing COTS at the middleware level (rather than just at lower hardware/networks/OS levels)  
?	Devising meta-programmable DRE framework techniques and optimizations, as well as secure multi-level distributed dynamic resource management protocols/services for adaptive and reflective middleware that will enable DoD DRE systems to customize standard COTS interfaces, without the performance and flexibility penalties incurred by conventional COTS implementations and
?	Building middleware services that enable applications to be independent of the particular resource management protocols, security policies, and fault tolerant mechanisms required.

For this BAA, there are two proposal categories, "Technology Developer" and "OEP Developer".  An organization may submit multiple proposals in each proposal category, however an organization's eligibility for funding is restricted to one of these categories.

OEP Developer

The OEP Developer supplies the ARMS program with specific challenge problems that describe the current operational state in the TSCE domain and describe quantifiable performance-oriented goals that will enable significant increases in overall domain performance, but also require significant technological innovation to realize. The OEP Developer will integrate ARMS technologies into the TSCE testbed as an objective evaluator, conduct formal experiments, analyze results, and feed recommendations back to the Technology Developers (TDs).

The OEP Developer will be the liaison between the TDs and the DD(X) Design Agent, and is responsible for conveying the DD(X) requirements, risks, complex computing system problems and other development needs to the TDs and for ensuring the TDs are addressing these needs. The OEP Developer will establish an Integrated Data Environment (IDE). This IDE will allow DARPA, the DD(X) Program Office, DD(X) Design Agent, and other DARPA approved Government laboratories remote digital access to ARMS Program documentation, software, and other developed technologies to facilitate the open communication and transition of information and technologies to the DD(X) Design Agent.

A primary emphasis of the OEP Developer experimental evaluation is the Quality of Service (QoS) of the ARMS DRE middleware. In that capacity, the ARMS OEP Developer will devise and validate methods and tools for evaluating the aggregate QoS of the ARMS DRE middleware and representative TSCE applications in terms of their latency/jitter, throughput, scalability, adaptability, stability, dependability, security, and static/dynamic reflective optimization capabilities. The OEP Developer will make the challenge problems, applications, and the integrated testbed itself accessible for all the TDs in the ARMS program.

Proposers in the OEP Developer category must propose a software test platform consistent with the TSCE concept described in the ARMS Program Background section, as well as specific challenge problems on which objective evaluation will be based.  Offerors for OEP Developer should demonstrate an ability to integrate ARMS tools into integrated end-to-end development scenarios and perform rigorous testing and evaluation of the resulting design frameworks.  Proposals in the OEP Developer area must delineate the constraints and performance drivers and must suggest test and evaluation methodologies for ARMS experiments based on their OEP.

It is anticipated that at most two OEP proposals will be selected for possible funding.

Technology Developer

Proposals are also solicited in two topical areas in the "Technology Developer" (TD) research category in the context of the testbed provided by the OEP Developer described above.  The two TD topical areas are described below:

Topic 1.	  Meta-programmable DRE Middleware Frameworks

DARPA is seeking proposals that will develop new theory, framework technologies, and tools for applying meta-programming techniques to DRE middleware and applications. Meta-programming involves policies and mechanisms that systematically decouple the functional path of an application from its various cross-cutting QoS properties and resources by decomposing the system into:
?	Base-components, which implement certain application functionality (such as sensor processing, tracking, and weapons release/control) and
?	Meta-components, which abstract key QoS properties (such as persistence, concurrency, scheduling priorities, atomicity, ordering, state, replication, and change notifications) from base-objects and control many aspects of their behavior adaptively and reflectively at run-time. 

Proposers of new meta-programmable DRE frameworks should demonstrate expertise in one or more areas of interest to  DoD combat system developers, such as time/space constraints, real-time QoS goals, cross-cutting aspects (such as security, predictability, and dependability), and open middleware standards.  Proposers should focus on demonstrating their expertise in the context of concrete DRE middleware for DoD combat systems.  Proposers must show how they can interface their frameworks with other ARMS components through common interface languages and knowledge representations, such as those based on UML/OCL, XML, Rational Rose, CORBA IDL, and others (such as those developed on the DARPA MoBIES project).  The interfaces and functional semantics of all meta-programmable DRE frameworks must be provided in open, extensible, well-documented formats, compliant with the middleware standards ARMS is developing and leveraging.  Frameworks developed for ARMS will be evaluated heavily on the ease with which they can be integrated with other frameworks and with standards-based meta-programmable middleware environments, such as the OMG Model Driven Architecture (MDA) efforts.

Proposals for meta-programmable DRE middleware frameworks should contain a description of their candidate middleware architecture, identify policies (explicitly or implicitly) on how data and resources it owns are used, document external and internal dependencies/constraints imposed, as well as rational of proposed middleware architecture and the process via which other ARMS Technology and OEP Developers will integrate their technologies with it.  The product of projects in this area should be capable of being transitioned to the middleware software market in the form of open protocols and interface standards.  Proposers in this area should also be able to work with and participate in standards bodies, such as the OMG or The Open Group, that are defining the protocols and interfaces necessary for DRE middleware interoperability.

It is anticipated that no more than four proposals will be selected in this area for possible funding and teaming is encouraged.

Topic 2.	Secure Multi-level Distributed Resource Management

DARPA is seeking proposals that will develop and evaluate a new generation of DRE middleware that can manage system resources adaptively and reflectively across multiple security levels of distributed systems in real-time. The goal of this task is to substantially improve the ability of middleware to enable applications and users to reason about and manage resources dynamically and dependably within multiple levels (i.e., networks, operating systems, and several layers of middleware) of complex DRE systems. The results will allow applications and users better control over these complex systems by (1) deferring the commitment of many resources from design-time until run-time, without sacrificing overall system predictability and dependability and (2) allowing higher-level mission doctrine to determine tradeoffs between resource allocation and reallocation strategies, thereby enhancing overall system effectiveness, verifiability, and lethality.

Proposals for secure multi-level distributed resource management should contain a description of their candidate middleware architecture, identify policies (explicitly or implicitly) on how data and resources it owns are used, document external and internal dependencies/constraints imposed, as well as rational of proposed middleware architecture and the process via which ARMS will integrate technologies with it.  Proposers in this area should demonstrate expertise in integrating meta-programmable DRE middleware frameworks with secure multi-level distributed resource management capabilities to form a coherent development tool suite suitable for the needs of the TSCE.  The product of projects in this area should be capable of being transitioned to the middleware software market in the form of open protocols and interface standards.  Proposers in this area should also be able to work with and participate in standards bodies, such as the OMG or The Open Group, that are defining the protocols and interfaces necessary for DRE middleware interoperability.

It is anticipated that no more than four proposals will be selected in this area for possible funding and teaming is encouraged.

For each Category: Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Research should result in prototype DRE middleware software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses purely on non-empirical methods.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.

The period of performance for proposed research efforts should be no longer than three years in duration, with demonstrable goals that can be evaluated empirically at the midway point (18 months).  Offerors in both categories, OEP and TD, must specify metrics associated with performance-based milestones that will enable DARPA management to systematically gauge the technical progress of the proposed effort.

Teaming is encouraged and proposals may involve multiple research groups and/or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.

<DESC>This revised version of BAA02-24 supercedes the version posted on September 13, 2002.  

GENERAL INFORMATION (See BAA02-24 Part 1 for Program Scope Info.) 


The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Information Exploitation Office (DARPA/IXO) requires completion of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Cover Sheet Submission for each Abstract/Proposal, by accessing the URL below:

http://www.dyncorp-is.com/ixo/index.asp?BAAid=02-24

After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet Submission, the proposer must print the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page.  Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to the 
"original" and each designated number of copies.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of your Abstract/Proposal.  If a proposer intends on submitting more than one Abstract/Proposal, a unique UserId and password should be used in creating each BAA Cover Sheet.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.  

PROPOSAL FORMAT

Proposers must submit an original and 4 copies of the full proposal and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in Microsoft Word ?97 for IBM-compatible, PDF, Postscript, or ASCII format on one 3.5-inch floppy disk or one 100 MB Iomega Zip disk).  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 02-24, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy ___ of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 NOON Local Time, Thursday, 10/31/02, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 02-24 will remain open until 12:00 NOON Local Time, Friday, 10/31/03.  Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through Friday, 10/31/03. While the proposals submitted after Thursday, 10/31/02, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should be mindful that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.

Proposers must obtain the BAA 02-24 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, proposal abstracts, and full proposal formats.  This Pamphlet will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail, mail request to the administrative contact address given below, or at URL address http://www.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations/arms/index.htm.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the Pamphlet may not be reviewed.

The objective of the Program Composition for Embedded Systems (PCES) is to create new language and compiler technology for developing distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) middleware and applications that reduces complexity by separating application functional concerns (such as exploitation algorithms, rules of engagement processing, or weapons targeting) from cross-cutting systemic concerns (such as synchronization of concurrent operations, processor fault isolation, sensor input and actuator output timing constraints, distribution, and safe/efficient cache, register, and memory management).  The Sensor-to-Decision Maker-Shooter/Weapons (SDMS/W) kill chain used to prosecute Time Critical Targets (TCTs) is an excellent example of DRE systems and their need for highly flexible, dependable, and efficient software.  The kill chain refers to the Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage, and Assess (F2T2EA) process used by an Air Operations Center (AOC) to commit strike resources against a TCT.  All of these operations must be accomplished within a short time window to destroy elusive mobile targets.  Since attack maneuvering and the weapon alignment and fly out consume most of the time interval, the actual strike decision must be made by the legal authorities and relayed to the pilot and/or weapon within seconds of combat identification of the target.  

The PCES program addresses the following factors that have historically increased software fragility and total ownership costs and imperiled the success of numerous new and planned DoD programs:
1.	Multiple platform and varying operational contexts. DoD systems must invest an ever-increasing proportion of functionality in DRE software to retain technological dominance. Rapidly emerging technologies and flexibility required for diverse operational contexts force deployment of multiple versions of software on various platform architectures, while preserving key properties, such as secure, dependable, and real-time response.  
2.	Total ownership costs. Software development and evolution is labor-intensive and error-prone for complex DoD DRE systems and can represent over 50% of the total ownership costs of these systems.    
3.	Obsolescence trends. Incommensurate lifetimes between DoD systems (20 years or more) and computational platform (2-5 years) lead to pervasive software obsolescence and multiply the total ownership costs by requiring periodic software re-development and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) refresh.    

This BAA solicits proposals in two research categories, "Open Experimentation Platform (OEP) Developer" and "Technology Developer."  Offerors in both categories must specify metrics associated with performance-based milestones that enable DARPA management to systematically gauge the technical progress of the proposed effort.  The period of performance for proposed research efforts should be no longer than two years in duration.

OEP Developer

The OEP Developer supplies the PCES program with specific challenge problems that must describe the current operational state in the domain of Sensor-to-Decision Maker-Shooter (SDMS/W) systems, and describe quantifiable performance-oriented goals that would enable significant increases in overall domain performance, but also require significant technological innovation to realize. The OEP developer will also integrate PCES technologies into the SDMS/W testbed as an objective evaluator, conduct formal experiments, analyze results, and feed recommendations back to the Technology Developers (TDs). 

The primary emphasis of this experimental evaluation is the quality (both at design time and at run-time) of the PCES DRE middleware. In that capacity, the OEP developer will devise and validate methods and tools for evaluating the aggregate QoS of the PCES DRE middleware and representative SDMS/W applications in terms of their flexibility, correctness, latency/jitter, throughput, scalability, adaptability, stability, dependability, and optimization capabilities. The OEP Developer will make the challenge problems, SDMS/W applications, and the integrated SDMS/W testbed itself accessible for all the TDs in the PCES program.

Proposers in the OEP Developer category should propose a SDMS/W software test platform of interest to the Armed Services, as well as specific challenge problems on which objective evaluation will be based.  Offerors for OEP Developer should demonstrate an ability to integrate PCES tools into integrated end-to-end development scenarios and perform rigorous testing and evaluation of the resulting design frameworks.  Proposals in the OEP Developer area must delineate the SDMS/W constraints and performance drivers and must suggest test and evaluation methodologies for PCES experiments based on their OEP.

It is anticipated that no more than one proposal will be selected in this area for possible funding.

Technology Developer

Proposals are also solicited in two topical areas in the "Technology Developer" (TD) research category in the context of the SDMS/W testbed provided by the OEP Developer described above.  The two TD topical areas are described below:

Topic 1.	  DRE Middleware Generation and Optimization Tools

DARPA is seeking proposals that will develop languages, algorithms, patterns, and code bases to support the generation and optimization of DRE middleware that can be customized for specific mission requirements and constraints of DoD SDMS/W systems and applications. The middleware will be generated automatically and optimized via algorithms that can be tailored declaratively to adapt to key DRE platform characteristics, e.g., interconnection mechanisms, event demultiplexing mechanisms, I/O mechanisms, synchronization and concurrency mechanisms, failure detection and recovery mechanisms, configuration mechanisms, and power levels. Automating the configuration and optimization of DRE middleware is essential since the need for stringent behavioral assurance makes verification and empirical validation of the customized middleware components necessary. Moreover, these capabilities will ensure that DoD systems can leverage standards-based COTS while simultaneously ensuring that key protocol, implementation, and QoS properties can remain unique in order to retain superiority over adversaries who have access to the same standards-based COTS middleware.

Proposers of new DRE middleware generation and optimization tools should demonstrate expertise in one or more areas of interest to DRE developers, such as time/space constraints, real-time performance goals, cross-cutting aspects, and/or open middleware standards.  Proposals should discuss the importance and prevalence of these features in the context of DRE middleware and SDMS/W systems.  Proposers should also be able to interface to other PCES components through common interface languages and knowledge representations, such as those based on UML/OCL, XML, Rational Rose, CORBA IDL, and others (such as those developed on the DARPA MoBIES project).  The interfaces and functional semantics of all DRE middleware generation and optimization tools will be required to be provided in open, extensible, well-documented formats, compliant with the middleware standards PCES is developing and leveraging.  Tools developed for PCES will be evaluated heavily on the ease with which they can be integrated with other tools and with standards-based middleware environments, such as the OMG Model Driven Architecture (MDA) efforts.

Any number of different tools may be proposed in a given proposal, though each proposal must comply with all submission requirements including page limits given in this PIP.  Each DRE middleware generation and optimization tool proposed should be structured as a unique, separately priced task option so that a subset of those tools proposed might be targeted for funding. One or more tool options may be targeted for funding from a given proposal, though it is anticipated that no more than four DRE middleware generation and optimization proposals will be selected for possible funding and teaming is encouraged.

Topic 2.	Distributed Quality Aspects

DARPA is seeking proposals that will develop new theory, technology, and tools for applying aspect-oriented techniques to DRE middleware and applications.  In particular, DARPA is seeking innovative techniques that can collect, organize, and disseminate QoS-related meta-information needed to (1) monitor and manage how well the functional interactions occur in SDMS/W systems and (2) enable the decision-making needed to support systemic QoS properties robustly in the face of rapidly changing SDMS/W mission requirements and environmental conditions. These middleware capabilities are crucial to ensure that the aggregate behavior of complex network-centric SDMS/W systems is dependable, despite local failures, transient overloads, and dynamic functional or QoS reconfigurations.

Proposals for distributed quality aspects should contain a description of their candidate middleware architecture and the process via which PCES will integrate technologies with it. To promote a common technology base, the interfaces and (where appropriate) the protocols used by PCES middleware should be based on (or should guide) established or emerging industry or DoD standards that are relevant for DoD DRE systems. However, the aspect-oriented technologies developed in the PCES program should also be customizable?statically and dynamically?for specific DoD DRE application and mission requirements. Proposers in this area should also be able to work with and participate in standards bodies, such as the OMG and The Open Group, that are defining the protocols and interfaces necessary for PCES middleware interoperability. 

It is anticipated that no more than four proposals will be selected in this area for possible funding and teaming is encouraged.
 
Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Research should result in prototype DRE middleware software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses purely on non-empirical methods.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.  Teaming is encouraged and proposals may involve multiple research groups and/or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.  The period of performance for proposed research efforts should be no longer than two years in duration. This BAA shall remain open and proposals received up to one year following this BAA?s release.

GENERAL INFORMATION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Information Exploitation Office (DARPA/IXO) requires completion of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Cover Sheet Submission for each Abstract/Proposal, by accessing the URL below:

http://www.dyncorp-is.com/ixo/index.asp?BAAid=02-25

After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet Submission, the proposer must print the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page.  Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to the 
"original" and each designated number of copies.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of your Abstract/Proposal.  If a proposer intends to submit more than one Abstract/Proposal, a unique UserId and password should be used in creating each BAA Cover Sheet.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.

Proposers are advised that the Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA/IXO Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report.  These reports will be electronically submitted via the DARPA/IXO Technical ? Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Further details may be found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).  

PROPOSAL FORMAT

Proposers must submit an original and 4 copies of the full proposal and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in Microsoft Word ?97 for IBM-compatible, PDF, Postscript, or ASCII format on one 3.5-inch floppy disk or one 100 MB Iomega Zip disk).  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 02-25, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy ___ of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 NOON Local Time, Wednesday, 10/30/02, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 02-25, Program Composition of Embedded Systems (PCES), will remain open until 12:00 NOON Local Time, Thursday, 10/30/03.  Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through Thursday, 10/30/03. While the proposals submitted after Wednesday, 10/30/02, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  Proposers must obtain the BAA 02-25 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, proposal abstracts, and full proposal formats.  This Pamphlet will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail, mail request to the administrative contact address given below, or at URL address http://dtsn.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations/pces/index.htm.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the Pamphlet may not be reviewed.  This Announcement, in conjunction with the BAA 02-25 PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.

For this BAA, there are two proposal categories, "Technology Developer" and "OEP Developer".  An organization may submit multiple proposals in each proposal category, however an organization's eligibility for funding is restricted to one of these categories only.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) No. D78031.  These solicitation clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27.  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code for this acquisition is 7379 and the North American Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541519.  The FDA intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Lincoln Technologies for the following service: Installation and Optimization of a New Integrated Web Visual Data Mining Environment (Web VDME) on a new server and laptop computer.  The Contractor will be responsible for the installation, testing, and documentation of required web based data mining software infrastructure and tools on a new server and laptop computers.  The Contractor will also help to complete the transition of the present data mining environment to the use of real-time CBAERS database.  This includes: optimization of memory, disk, and processor usage of both the server and laptop computers to support efficient data extractions and transformations and execution of large and complex data mining analyses (over the complete and real-time CBAERS database), including multi-dimensional analyses involving drug interactions and/or syndromes, as well as analyses of gender effects, age effects, and outcome effects with the server.  Will design and implement a production facility that will enhance the productivity and rapidly mass produce a complete and up-to-date library of data extraction and transformations and graphical safety summaries for all drugs and events in the database.  This will be highly automated and will produce the graphics and search index files necessary to support the internal safety data mining web site.  The Contractor will add the capability to mass-produce a library of graphic displays for all drugs and events by adding a new screen to the Web VDME.  From this screen the Principal Investigator will be able to populate the archive of graphs that will be stored as BLOBS in Oracle as one row per image.  Additional columns will contain the retrieval parameters including the version of the software, the date, the audit trail, etc.  The following will also be included: A query screen will allow for partial matches; Addition of new types of users with the ability to access the generated graphs and leave comments; Drill down to narratives and ancillary data such as gender, age outcomes, source from the graphs in the server and from the laptop computers; Potential ability to save new costumed produced graphs; Library of graphic displays will include the display of the progression of signals over time and delta graphs by drug and event; Ability to produce new graphic displays to be added to a library of graphs with comments.  Contractor will be available to provide timely ongoing technical support spanning issues relating to the underlying software, computational performance, data mining techniques, and graphical design, production, and optimization.  Will provide FDA with a no-cost internal-use license to enhanced contractor-developed data mining software related to these services.  Shall make use of the special remote access capabilities of the new server to carry out remote software installation, configuration, support and troubleshooting.  Period Of Performance: Five months from date of award.  The following FAR Clauses shall apply to this solicitation: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; and 52.232-33 Electronic Funds Transfers.  All responsible sources that can provide and meet the above requirements shall submit written quotations by the due date referenced above.  The award is being issued on a sole source basis because Lincoln Technologies, Inc. staff has been key participants in the design and implementation of the data mining software currently being used by the Office of Biostatistics.  They also have hands-on experience in working with the AERS data in several different formats and have consulted extensively with OB in the design of graphical techniques for summarizing safety data mining output.  They have collaborated with the Office of Biostatistics in the initial conceptualization and prototyping of the application of Bayesian data mining to the identification of safety signals in the SRS and AERS post-marketing surveillance databases.  FAR provisions can be found on the following website: http://www/arnet.gov.

<SUBJECT>69 -- Pacer Crag Simulator
<DESC>Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Procurement.  The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order for a Pacer Crag tabletop trainer simulator to Rockwell Collins, 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, IA 52498.  The simulator is manufactured by Rockwell Collins and used to simulate flight operations of the Pacer Crag cockpit system.  The 55th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because the Pacer Crag simulator will be custom fabricated and is the only simulator available which will accurately simulate the Pacer Crag cockpit system, a system proprietary to Rockwell Collins.  The procurement of this simulator in a timely manner is essential to meet mission requirements.  Questions should be directed to Jennifer Graham in writing via email:  jennifer.graham@offutt.af.mil or by facsimile:  (402) 294-7280.

<SUBJECT>A -- Protein Crystallization System
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE ITS INVENTION OF HIGH THROUGHPUT PROTEIN CRYSTALLIZATION SYSTEM

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's invention of a high throughput protein crystallization system.  The technology enables comprehensive crystallization screens for approximately eight (8) protein samples a day.  Protein samples are first prescreened and the concentration is adjusted to obtain optimum concentration for crystallization screening.  The protein is then subjected to a set of special screening conditions generated by software tools (CRYSTOOL) and setup with a liquid handling robot.  Typically, these screening conditions are set up in a 96-well deep well block and stored for later use.  Four blocks, or screens, of the conditions are usually sufficient for a comprehensive screening for a new protein.  After crystal-screening conditions are set up in crystallization experiments with a protein of interest, a robotic CCD microscope views the samples at regular intervals.  Images of each crystallization trial are taken and analyzed by a LLNL's proprietary, highly effective, crystal detection system to identify wells containing crystals.  Secondary review and confirmation of crystallogenesis is done by visual inspection of the acquired images. It often occurs that diffraction quality crystals are obtained from initial screens but information derived from initial screening experiments may also be used to optimize crystal formation and to harvest crystals for diffraction studies.  LLNL is in the process of filing patent applications and registering copyrights for the technology.  LLNL is looking for industrial partners to commercialize one or more applications of this invention.  Licenses to software for generating special screening conditions, or for crystal detection systems are available.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's high throughput protein crystallization system should provide a written statement of interest and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.  Companies interested in an end-user license for LLNL's software should also provide a written statement of interest. Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO02-015-302

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's high throughput protein crystallization system.

Currently there is no mechanism in place that provides standardized information.  The only measures of quality are provided by the regional accrediting agencies, which do not use the same standards.  The costs of running institutions are provided in budget documents but the cost of a program or course is not easily identified.  Currently the only means for collecting data is to request it from the institution, which is not required to provide it.  Additionally, standard definitions are not available to assist in comparing and analyzing similar data.  During the preceding year, the Chancellor's Office developed and tested a Microsoft ACCESS prototype for collecting and analyzing standardized information, called the Defense Academic Reporting System (DARS).  This system is based on higher education models encompassing DoD unique and collaboratively developed quality standards and metrics and Activity Based Costing resource framework.  The system will depict total cost and quality of DoD institutions, programs and courses and how resources are used to achieve quality education outcomes.  The ACCESS prototype is now ready to be developed as a  decision support system.  However, the current ACCESS database does not allow for easy collection and consolidation of data. The available reporting and analytical capability provided by ACCESS is severely limited and does not meet the requirements of the Chancellor?s office.   Requirements:  The Contractor will use the existing government furnished DARS prototype and develop a new software application to collect data elements as specified in the current DARS model, to develop analytical and ad hoc query capability as well as develop standard data report models.   This requirement includes, but is not limited to Conversion of the ACCESS based data input forms to meet system business rules and functionality requirements;  Aggregation of multiple relational data tables into a more efficient table(s);  Assistance in developing complex standard report models;  Developing capability to generate standard data reports, sve the queries and export reports to customers;  Developing on-line-analytical processing capabilities for ad hoc queries and ?what-if?analyses;  Providing at least 2 days of training on the revised DARS.   The Government shall provide :  Software:  The Microsoft ACCESS Defense Academic Reporting System Prototype.  The Associated Documentation is as follows:  Standard definitions, User?s Manual, Database architecture and record layouts, Statement of business rules and functionality.  The Government Furnished Equipment is a one (1) stand-alone Desktop computer:   Processor: Pentium 266 MHz or higher.  Memory (RAM): 256 MB (Win 98/ NT 4.0/Win 2000), and office space and telephone and fax access.  Place of performance will be: Office of the Chancellor for Education and Professional Development, Suite 200, 4040 Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203.  The work will be accomplished between the hours of 0800 and 1700, Monday thru Friday, Federal holidays excluded.  The period of performance shall be for four months beginning after date of contract award, but not to exceed beyond December 31, 2002.  The actual workdays shall not exceed 25 days within the four-month period.  Offers are due no later than 25 Sep 02.  Quotations must be submitted electronically to: crystal_clark@hq.dla.mil.   All contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to receiving an award; see web-site www.ccr.dlis.dla.gov for details on CCR.   Requests for information concerning solicitation can be made by e-mail to crystal_clark@hq.dla.mil or FAX 703-767-1183.

The restoration of signal will begin at the start of HQ AFRC's normal working day. The government will record every outage and will retain the right to reduce the monthly payment to the Contractor by $0.35 for every minute each signal is lost beyond the two-hour restoration of necessary signal for each outage.
