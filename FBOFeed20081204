<DESC><p>The Air Armament Center, 808th Armament Systems Group, 685th Armament Systems Squadron at Eglin AFB, FL 32542 is contemplating the sole source award of purchase order FA8677-09-M-0081 to GD/OTS Garland, 1200 North Glenbrock Drive, Garland, TX 75040. It is intended that the award be made to support the on-going test and qualification of Insensitive Munitions (IM) and design enhancements to accommodate AFX-795 explosive fill in the MK84 Mod 10 empty case with IM Improvements. The MOD 10 after delivery and lapped with AFX-795 make up a BLU-117 general purpose warhead. A December 2008 award is anticipated for the procurement of five (5) MK84 Mod 10 warhead cases valued at an estimated $33,000.00. The MK84 Mod 10 case configuration with the incorporation of the improved IM components will make up the BLU-117 configuration. The MK84 Mod 10 has a TDP number of 923AS425 Rev B. managed by the Navy and procured through the Navy once the 685th finishes final qualification of the new design. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The procurement of 5 MK84 Mod 10 cases can only be met by GD-OTS because they are the only vendor that has been successfully qualified by Joint Munitions Command (JMC) to manufacture these products to the Government's specifications. In addition, their existing tooling will allow deliveries in time to meet the accelerated qualification schedule directed by the Air Staff. The hardware improvements for the BLU-117 shall be manufactured in accordance with (IAW) the following drawings: 923AS425 Rev B. The 5 assembled MK84 Mod 10 warhead cases are to be shipped to McAlister Army Ammunition Plant.
<p>A firm fixed price type purchase order is contemplated. It is estimated that the purchase order will have a period of performance of 3 months. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The clause at 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the points of contact identified below. The AAC Ombudsman is BGen Michael N. Wilson, AAC/CV, (850) 882-5422, or michael.wilson2@eglin.af.mil. For further information concerning technical aspects, contact Joseph Stromsness, (850) 883-3235 or e-mail joseph.stromsness@eglin.af.mil or Terry Byrd 850-883-7571 or email terry.byrd@eglin.af.mil .

<SOLNBR>RFP-ToBeDetermined
<CONTACT>Lenox Coles, Jr., Fax 202-245-6297, Email lenox.coles@ed.gov
<DESC>The US Department of Education anticipates the release of the Integrated Posecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) solicitation on or about December 19, 2008.  Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) is the Deppartment's core postsecondary education data collection program. It is a single, comprehensive system that encompasses all institutions whose primary purpose is to provide postsecondary education.  IPEDS consists of institutional-level data that can be used to describe trends in postsecondary education at the institutional, state, and/or national levels, as well as to provide students and families with consumer information about colleges and universities. Postsecondary education is defined within IPEDS as the provision of formal instructional programs the curriculum of which is designed primarily for students who have completed the requirements for a high school diploma or its equivalent. This includes academic, vocational, and continuing professional education programs, and excludes avocational and adult basic education programs.  The following types of institutions are included within IPEDS: 4-year (baccalaureate or higher degree- and certificate-granting institutions), 2-year institutions (generally community and technical colleges), and less-than-2-year institutions (institutions whose awards usually result in terminal occupational awards or are creditable toward a formal 2-year or higher award). Each of these three categories is further disaggregated by control (public, private not-for-profit, private for-profit) resulting in nine institutional sectors.  Specialized, but compatible, reporting formats have been developed for these nine sectors of postsecondary education providers. This design feature accommodates the varied operating characteristics, program offerings, and reporting capabilities that differentiate postsecondary institutional sectors while yielding comparable statistics for all sectors.  The IPEDS universe contains over 7,000 institutions; approximately 6,800 are Title IV institutions. While all postsecondary institutions may participate in the IPEDS web-based collections designed for Title IV participants, most institutions that do not have Title IV participation agreements (referred to as non-Title IV) do not respond.  IPEDS currently includes approximately 200 degree- or certificate-granting non-Title IV institutions that are open to the public, and whose primary mission is the provision of postsecondary education.  IPEDS web-based data collections are typically conducted annually over a 10-month period (August to May) with differing opening and closing dates for different components of the collections.  Each of these collections will use web-based survey procedures.  Further information concerning IPEDS and the design of the web-based collection is available on NCESs web page, http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/.  This study will begin with the 2009-10 data collection and continue through the 2012-13 collection, covering four (4) full data collection cycles.  All data will be collected using a web-based system.  As mentioned above, Title IV institutions are required to respond; for non-Title IV, participation is voluntary.  In addition to including data in tabular reports that includes methodology information, the data for each responding institution are to be displayed within the College Navigator system (see http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/) and in the IPEDS data dissemination system. Note: All correspondence with non-respondents is limited to Title IV schools; data presented in publications is also limited to the Title IV schools; however, if non-Title IV schools voluntarily respond, their data will be included in College Navigator.  Each complete IPEDS survey cycle extends for a period of about 18 months from initial preparation of survey screens and edits through adjudication of the final report and documentation.  Cycles will overlap for a period of about 6 months.  The government may extend the contract for up to an additional 60 months, which would include another 4 full survey cycles  collections from 2013-14 through 2017-18 (see Institute of Education Sciences legislation Part A section 154(c)).  The government shall decide on a unilateral basis whether to extend this contract for the additional five years.  This shall be a full & open competition.  All responsible parties are invited to submit an offer when the solicitation is released.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>WPJ-08-0894  PERIMETER IMPROVEMENTS PROJECT, NEBRASKA AVENUE COMPLEX (NAC), 3801 NEBRASKA AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC  
 

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity to procure services of a highly qualified construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for an overall security enhancement of both physical spaces and security equipment in and around the perimeter of a campus of federal office buildings which is located on a 38 acre complex in Northwest Washington, DC. This complex is commonly known as the Nebraska Avenue Complex (NAC).

GSA intents to award a firm-fixed price contract utilizing Source Selection procedures that represents the best value to the Government, as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15.  Under this Source Selection, non-price factors are significantly more important than price.

This procurement is not set-aside for small businesses.  However, this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Women-owned businesses are encouraged to submit bids and so state that they are women-owned.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) issuance date is September 30, 2008; and the RFP due date is October 30, 2008.   GSA is issuing this solicitation electronically and on CD-ROM.  You may access the RFP documents at the Federal Business Opportunity Website Home Page at http://www.FEDBIZOPPS.gov.  However, the construction project drawings will be available on CD-ROM only.  Potential offerors may pick-up a CD-ROM copy of the construction project drawings on September 30, 2008 at the General Services Administration, National Capital Region, Regional Office Building, Bid Room, Room 1065, 7th & D Streets, SW, Washington, DC.  Please reference Solicitation Number WPJ-08-0894 when requesting the bid documents and drawings. 

Construction completion and final acceptance is expected to occur within 25 months after a notice to proceed (NTP). GSA is planning to award this contract in early 2009.

The estimated cost for the project is between $15,000,000 and $25,000,000 dollars.

This project will include major renovations and demolition of several buildings located at the NAC. There will also be construction of new guard booths, vehicle screening building, upgraded fencing and electronic security equipment used to monitor the site. This is a turnkey project.

Due to the substantial amount and complexity of electronic equipment required on the project it is expected that the Prime Contractor will have as a part of their team, a technology systems integrator, security specialist, AV and IT specialists. Some portions of the technology systems will be required to be certified by the Underwriters Laboratory (UL).  Therefore, appropriate parties of the team of technology subcontractors will be required to have applicable UL certifications.

Interested Offeror(s) must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, which has successfully and satisfactorily completed projects of similar complexity, scope, and size, or which has similar projects currently under construction.

Offeror(s), individually or as a team, must have the capacity to obtain performance and payment bonding for up to 100% of the firm-fixed price.  

While the contractors personnel will have to satisfy the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 the Government does not anticipate that any special security clearance (i.e. TOP SECRET) will be required to participate in this procurement.

The RFP will require the proposals be submitted in a two volume set.  Volume I will be the Technical Proposal and Volume II will be the Pricing Proposal.  The selection process will utilize source selection procedures in accordance with the FAR Part 15.  The selection process will use tradeoffs.  Non-price factors are significantly more important than the price related factors.  The technical proposals evaluation (non-price) factors are as follows: Capabilities/Experience (33%), Past Performance (25%), Technical Approach (22%), and Small Disadvantaged Business Participation (20%).

Offerors will be required to address Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) considerations in 
the technical portion of their proposals.  Offerors shall provide a SDB Participation Plan that outlines their targets, expressed as dollars and percentage of the total contract value, in each 
of the applicable, authorized NAICS Industry Subfactor, and a total target for SDB participation by contractor, including joint venture partnership, and team members, and a total for SDB participation by subcontractors.

YOU ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF UPLOAD OF THE RFP AT THIS SITE AND REGISTER ON THE INTERESTED VENDOR LIST (IVL).  



THERE WILL BE NO PUBLIC BID OPENING.

<DESC>THIS IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT REGISTER FOR PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS AT THIS TIME. THE DRAFT PLANS (60%) are AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW ON OUR WEBSITE (see instructions below). The Government may consider comments and inquiries while preparing the final plans and specs; however, the Government is not seeking comments and may not provide responses to inquiries. A solicitation will be issued on or about the 21 January 2009 with proposals due on or about 21 March 2009.<BR>The purpose of the L-31 North (L-30) Seepage Management Pilot Project (SMPP) is to identify, test, and determine the relative effectiveness of seepage management technologies in order to recommend features to control groundwater flow and levee seepage from Everglades National Park.  Additionally, the project will help determine the constructability of a seepage management barrier to various depths/lengths within the semi-confining unit of the aquifer and may also yield results beneficial to the implementation of the full-scale Everglades National Park Seepage Management Project.  The proposed project is located in Miami-Dade County, north of Tamiami Trail (U.S. Highway 41) and Krome Ave (Route 997).  The L-30 borrow canal and levee mainly runs north-south but makes roughly a 45-degree southwesterly departure from Krome Avenue until it intersects Tamiami Trail, thereby forming what is commonly known as the L-30 triangle.  This 1.25 mile segment of the L-30 Canal, between S-335 and S-334, has been found to be an extremely thick portion of the Biscayne Aquifer with very high measured transmissivity.  A field drawdown test performed as a part of the L-31N SMPP and a Preliminary Seepage Report based on historical data for the area both found the triangle to have the highest seepage rate per mile between S-335 and S-334.   Conceptual Design - The tentatively selected alternative will include the design, installation, and testing of a subsurface seepage management barrier augmented with collection pipes and seepage recovery wells located within the barrier, adjacent to a sheet pile window in the L-30 levee located north of US Highway 41 (Tamiami Trail) between water control structures S-335 and S-336.  The barrier will have dimensions of approximately 80100 feet in depth and approximately 1,0002,200 feet in length.  The selected alternative proposes the placement of a barrier feature using a soil-cement-bentonite (SCB) mix and sheetpile construction technique.  The seepage barriers exact length and depth will be determined using detailed field data, engineering expertise from technical team members, and the A-E contractor. It is anticipated that installation of the seepage barrier through the geologic layers in the project area will be hard limestone may prove difficult, and will most likely require creative engineering techniques for excavating.  This design proposes a SCB slurry wall with a 6 ft. wide  trench.  A 100-ft long shallow sheet pile wall section is proposed as a gap in the slurry wall that will act as a shallow window to direct any desired seepage flow.  During periods of high water flow in the aquifer, seepage flows passing through the window will be captured by the system of wells and pumps.  Wells and pumps will be installed to capture the desired quantity of flow and pump it into the Water Conservation Area 3B as surface water or into adjacent canals.  The pumping system design will allow for the pumps to be controlled locally as well as from a remote location using telemetry.  Flow measurement devices will be installed at the ends and at the mid-point of the barrier.  An approximate 10-ft by 10-ft control building will be required to house electrical controls and panels at the mid-point of the barrier.  It is anticipated that the sheet pile depth can also be adjusted to create varying window size as needed.  Preliminary design concept places the sheet pile at a depth of approximately 50 ft.  General Construction - The following engineering features are conceptual in nature and may or may not represent the final design of this project.  Soil-Cement Bentonite Slurry Wall - The Soil-Cement-Bentonite (SCB) slurry wall will be placed in a 3-ft wide trench cut out of a 6 ft. wide pre-blasted zone.  By possibly  pre-blasting this zone the properties of the porous limestone will change to a zone containing less permeable materials.  The trench is to be excavated through the pre-blasted zone of limestone down to a pre-established invert elevation with a base in the less permeable Tamiami Sands.  Typically soil-cement-bentonite (SCB) walls are 24 to 30 inches wide and match the width of the equipment.  In this case the blasted zone is anticipated to be approximately six (6) feet wide which allows for ~30 inch trench centered within the blasted lower permeability zone leaving lower permeability material on both sides of the trench.  It is reasoned that the engineered filter will enable the wall to be constructed using conventional excavating equipment (e.g., extended stick backhoe or similar) is probable, while minimizing loss of the bentonite slurry mixture.  After the six feet wide trench has been blasted, the 30-inch trench will be excavated.  As the excavation proceeds, bentonite-water slurry is continuously added to build a filter pack and ensure that the trench remains open.  After the blasted material has been excavated, it is replaced with a backfilled mixture of soil-cement-bentonite.  The preliminary mix design assumes 10 to 15% cement and 2 to 5% bentonite mixed with the excavated rock materials.  Sheet Pile Wall - A sheet pile wall will be constructed at the midsection of the slurry wall. This 100 ft long shallow sheet pile wall will be inserted to bridge the gap between the 2 sections of slurry wall to act as a shallow window directing or funneling any seepage flow.   The pumps could be possibly used to divert excess seepage.  The sheet pile depth of emplacement and size may be varied or later changed to create a window of varying size depending on need.  The method of installation may require a creative exaction technique (ex. Blasting through limestone layers), followed by pile driving to a pre-established invert elevation by hammer or vibratory methods.  There is likely to be some disturbance surrounding the piles so there is possible need for seepage tightening of the wall by grouting or other sealing methods.  This seepage tightening will seal any holes or gaps in between individual piles that remain after installation would be plugged. Disposal - All unsuitable material will be disposed of within the L-31N right-of-way. Cleared, grubbed and excavated materials that are suitable for reuse may be stockpiled on site for grading and erosion control of the embankment.  Staging - It is anticipated that the A-E contractor will need approximately 1 acre for staging construction trailers and 3-4 acres for the staging heavy construction equipment.  Access to the project site could be from State Rd 997 (Krome Ave.) and/or from U.S. Highway 41 (Tamiami Trail) by S-334 or S-356. As a first option, the team would like to the contractor to use the area is within the L-31N right-of way located along L-31N (south bank), beginning 0.5 mile south of the north gate at U.S. Highway 41, then southward about 0.25 mile.

<CONTACT>Gregory E. Taitt, Contracting Officer, Email gtaitt@usaid.gov
<DESC>The purpose of the municipal governance program is to create effective, responsive, democratic, transparent, accountable and gender sensitive municipal governance in Afghanistan.  Through the municipal governance program, USAID will help the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA): (1) clarify the local governance framework; (2) provide responsive policy guidance and assistance to sub-national entities; (3) strengthen the legal, fiscal, economic and service delivery functions of municipalities; and (4) foster greater citizen participation in municipal governance.  As a result of municipal governance assistance, Afghan citizens will know where to turn to for better delivery of services, will understand the responsibilities of local governance leaders, will play an active role in the decision making process and will see local governance structures as legitimate.  To meet these objectives, USAID envisions working in 30-40 municipalities (inclusive of Kabul) and will be releasing a request for proposal in early 2009.

<DESC>The Indian Health Service (IHS) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for construction of the new Norton Sound Regional Hospital in Nome, Alaska. Please note that this is not a request for proposals and the Government is only seeking information for market research and acquisition planning purposes. 

This project will involve construction of an approximate 146,250 SF steel frame structure including 3 levels plus a mechanical penthouse.  The building will be located in Nome, Alaska on a 38.9 acre site. The replacement hospital will provide space and adequately support a modern, fully staffed health care delivery program including inpatient acute care and nursing and delivery (14 beds); endoscopy; outpatient surgery; ambulatory care; emergency and urgent care; ancillary for diagnostic imaging and laboratory; dental; optometry; audiology; respiratory and physical therapy; community health including public health nursing; nutrition; health education; alcoholism; environmental health; mental health and social services.

This project is presently being designed under a grant awarded by the Denali Commission to the Norton Sound Health Corporation (NSHC). The design by the firm of Kumin Associates, Inc. of Anchorage, Alaska in association with Mahlum Architects of Seattle, Washington is anticipated to be completed in February 2009.  NSHC will own and operate the new hospital which will be built on land owned by NSHC.  NSHC has also completed construction of the foundation gravel pad and the steel pile foundation will be complete by February 2009.

The current estimated construction cost range is $90 to $130 million.  Full funding for the construction project has not been appropriated but is anticipated to be made available in phases over 5 fiscal years beginning in Fiscal Year 2009.  The NAICS code for this effort is 236220 and the Small Business size standard is $33.5 million.   

General Contractors interested in this opportunity should submit a letter of interest that includes the following information to Abram Vinikoor at abram.vinikoor@ihs.gov by December 31, 2008. 

1. Provide the name of firm, a brief description of the firms history and capabilities and the contact information for the primary point of contact. 

2. Provide a brief narrative on three projects that you feel demonstrates your firms prior experience in providing general construction services of similar size, scope and location. 

3. Would your firm bid or propose on the project on its own or as a part of a joint venture?

4. Based upon the size standard, provide your business size and status: Large Business, Small Business, Indian or Native owned, Small Disadvantaged, Veteran Owned Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a) Contractor, or HubZone. 

5. What is the current and anticipated bonding capacity of your firm?

6. What issues should the Government consider in phasing and contracting the construction in the most efficient manner given the construction seasons and conditions in Nome? 

7. The early purchase of structural steel is being considered in 2009 so it could be provided as Government Furnished Materials for installation by the General Contractor in Spring 2010. Would this be advantageous? What assistance could you provide to the Government during steel detailing and fabrication to facilitate installation of the structural steel?  

8. Do you have any other recommendations on packaging the acquisition that would simplify the acquisition process or make participating in the project more likely for your firm?

<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), intends to issue a solicitation for proposals for a five year contract (base plus option) for the Trade and Accession Facilitation for Afghanistan (TAFA) project. The purpose of the project is to generate economic growth, trade and investment by improving the conditions for international and cross-border trade and transit.  It is expected to help the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) and the private sector to realize the advantages of greater regional and global trade linkages and export-oriented business development through assistance in three categories: 1) trade policy liberalization, 2) trade facilitation, and 3) public outreach on trade-related issues.  

The project is expected to result in the Afghan Governments improved capacity to negotiate and implement regional trade agreements and make progress toward WTO accession; to increase efficiency and transparency while reducing obstacles to trade in such areas as customs, transport/transit, and border crossing operations; to expand customs revenue collections; to raise its rating on the trading across borders indicator in the World Banks Doing Business survey; to enlarge its export market opportunities through adoption of international product and safety standards; and to increase understanding of and support for a liberal trade regime by the business community and the public throughout Afghanistan. 

The order of magnitude for this project anticipated by this solicitation is over US$10,000,000.

This solicitation will be accomplished using full and open competition and all interested parties will be invited to submit their proposals.  USAID intends to provide the maximum flexibility to each offeror and will issue a detailed Request for Proposals (RFP). It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued in January 31, 2009 (the RFP would be posted at FedBizOpps). 

Please do not consider this announcement an RFP and do not submit your proposals until the formal RFP is posted.

<DESC>U.S. Coast Guard Rescue 21 Program Resident Office Alaska is performing a preliminary Technology Assessment of vertical axis wind generators  vertical axis wind turbines.  The purpose of this preliminary assessment is to determine the feasibility of using vertical axis wind generators on harsh remote Alaska mountain tops as supplemental power for search and rescue communication sites.

The USCG has, in the past, tried several types of conventional horizontal axis wind generators designed for high wind and harsh environments without success.

Information is requested on vertical axis wind generators  vertical axis wind turbines in the 500 Watt to 10 KW range, specifically designed to withstand winds speeds in excess of 120 mph, wind gusts even higher, along with freezing rain, ice buildup, and snow.

The existing remote search and rescue communications site use a hybrid power system with a nominal 24 VDC positive ground back up battery bank for equipment power.  It is expected that new generation sites will be powered in a similar fashion.

The Coast Guard is specifically interested in Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) equipment currently in use.  When responding to this RFI, please include information such as number of units produced to date and installation/application information including point of contact/reference, location, year installed, etc.

This Request for Information (RFI) is part of an overall strategy to identify potential applications for wind generated power for remote communications sites. The information obtained by this RFI will be included in a market study that may be coupled with a hands-on evaluation to identify which system or systems may be considered by the USCG for potential fielding.

This notice is for informational and market research purposes only; it is not a solicitation. The USCG will not reimburse for the information submitted. There is no guarantee that any solicitations will result from this notice but if your firm is interested in providing information please send no later than December 19, 2008 to:

<DESC>Mission Installation Contracting Command Center- Fort Bragg, North Carolina intends to award, on a sole source basis in accordance with 10 USC 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, a contract to Scotland Aero Services Inc., 16701 Airport Road, Maxton, North Carolina  for airport usage and parachute training jumps  from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009.  Laurinburg/Maxton drop zone is the only commercial activity in the area with Federal Aviation Administration approved aircraft, pilots and drop zone certified for competition by the United States Parachute Association and meets all of the prerequisites of the USAPT.  The drop zone is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week and is readily accessible to the USAPT (US Army Parachute Team).  The training requires each team member to perform an average 8 to 10 jumps per day. The location of the facility is vital in that it is within 25 nautical miles radius from Fort Bragg.  The airport must be able to accommodate the following aircraft:     (2)  C-31A Fokker F27MK400M ;  (2) UV-18A DeHavilland Twin  Otters;  and Aircraft light (aircraft type TBD). There are no commercial airways over the Laurinburg/Maxton Airport which allows take offs and landing on a routine basis therefore eliminating mission delays.  The USAPT jumps from between 3,500 to 12,500 feet ten times a day. The location and facilities are instrumental in the fulfillment of the contract.  Failure to obtain these parachute training jumps will result in inadequate preparation and training to enable the USAPT competition teams to compete in the United States National Championships and the World Championships.  Demonstration Teams will not be able to maintain proficient skydiving skills which enable them to  safely land in highly populated, tight spaces.Tandem Team would not be fully capable of  providing category 1-4 tandems in support of the  teams recruiting mission.  Failure to purchase these items would decrease effectiveness and perform of the USAPT.  This is not a Request for Competitive Proposals.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If you feel your firm possesses the ability to provide these supplies, then you must respond by demonstrating your firms technical capability to meet the requirements.  If no affirmative written response is received, the supplies will be awarded without further notice.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the email address provided below no later than December 11, 2008, 1:00 pm EST.  Point of contact for this notice is Renee M.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a modification to an existing contract with the Academy for Education and Development (AED) on a noncompetitive, cost only (no fee) basis. The Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP) in Pakistan is to train local personnel to respond to epidemics. The end of the period of performance for the contract and the proposed modification is August 31, 2009. No follow-on contract is planned. The proposed modification will cover approximately eleven training courses ranging from 5 days to 8 weeks, with number of participants ranging from 10 to 30. As a part of the training, staff and trainees may respond to epidemic outbreaks for actual field experience. For continuation and consistency of this training it is imperative to utilize AED for this modification. AED's ability to perform this work in a timely manner will enable training for more Pakistani personnel needed for increasing numbers of epidemic outbreaks. The North American Industry Classification Code is 541611.</p>

<SUBJECT>Sole Source Notice to Oregon State University from USDA/NRCS Plant Material Center in Corvallis, OR
<SOLNBR>NRCS-OR-09-001
<RESPDATE>121808

<DESC>The USDA/NRCS Corvallis Plant Material Center (PMC )would like to continue its long standing relationship with Oregon State University (OSU).  Listed below are the reasons for our decision for a Sole Source Procurement:

Item 1  The USDA/NRCS Corvallis PMC seeks to purchase from OSU supplies and services including machinery, equipment operators, water, fuel, fertilizer, pesticides, shop services, student labor (summer), facility maintenance and library services.

Item 2  The supplies and services will be used to carry out the goals and mission of the USDA/NRCS Corvallis PMC in a cooperative and cost effective manner.

Item 3  To carry out our goals and mandates, USDA/NRCS Corvallis PMC has determined that it will need to acquire through procurement the previously stated services and supplies for a total estimated cost of $44,100.00.

Item 4  The USDA/NRCS Corvallis PMC is located on OSU property and has leased farm land and building space from OSU for decades.  The yearly charge of $1 for building space is obviously cost effective.  Being located on the OSU Hyslop Farm, plant materials center staff is free to use OSU specialty farm equipment whenever needed, thus saving valuable time and money for the program.  OSU is able to meet all of the specifications needed by the Plant Material Center including building space, on site irrigation wells, shop services, facility maintenance and equipment operators for the same cost charged to other OSU facilities and programs.

Item 5  The USDA/NRCS Corvallis PMC has been located on the OSU Hyslop Farm for decades.  The land lease rate charged to USDA/NRCS is far less than similar farm land in the area.  We are able to buy local supplies under an OSU purchase order for major discounts because of our association with the college.  The USDA/NRCS Corvallis PMC is also able to get field inspections done for free because of our association with the farm, which saves hundreds of dollars.  Beside the overall cost advantage offered by OSU, the technical expertise of OSU faculty and staff is invaluable.  Because of our long standing relationship, techniques and equipment have been developed over the years that make farming small areas such as our very cost effective not offered by different locations.

Please refer to the Sole Source Justification.  This is not a solicitation; it is notice of intent to sole source a requirement.Inquiries/information received after the established deadline shall not be considered.  The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-2.JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION		*1.  Identification of the service/department and the transaction/requisition #:VA Boston Healthcare System:  Transaction: 523-09-1-9183-0036*2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved:SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT SERVICE FOR MAVERIC RESEARCH DEPARTMENT*3.  Description of the supplies/services required to meet the agencys needs (including the estimated value):Time is urgent and compelling with in an eight week turn around period.  Service to provide analysis on 1600 DNA samples on the Affymetrix Gene Chip Human 6.0 array. This array is the only DNA Chip available that combines 900,000 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and 946,000 non-polymorphic copy number probes (CNPs) for genome-wide association studies.  The use of this array is an integral part of the planned DVA CSP study and array substitutions will not be allowed.Estimated cost:  $1,000,000 ($625 per DNA sample)4.	  Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:FAR Part 6.302-2 Unusual and compelling urgency *5.  Demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:The Affymetrix GeneChip Human 6 array was developed and is manufactured by Affymetrix.  The chip arrays, the processing system, all reagents, and software are patented and sold only through Affymetrix.  Although other laboratories can purchase Affymetrix equipment, chips, and reagents and perform this function on a fee for service basis, we decided to have this project done at Affymetrix for the following reasons:Experience:  As the manufacturer and sole provider of the complete analysis system, this company has much more experience than any other company.  Affymetrix has processed > than 100,000 samples.  Greater than 25,000 samples have been analyzed on the Gene Chip 6 array with greater than 99% call rates.  Capacity: As the manufacturer of the equipment, Affymetrix has more instruments available than other institutions and have the capacity to process 2880 samples per week.  Security:  VA personnel have visited the Affymetrix laboratories and seen their physical, information, and data security systems.  All of their facilities are protected by key card access and have environmental controls offering sample and data security system that are more elaborate than the typical laboratory.  Data access is limited and audited.  Data files are routinely backed-up.  Data is encrypted with digital keys and signatures until securely delivered to the VA.  *6.  Describe the efforts that have been made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a Commerce Business Daily notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:Notice will be published7.	 Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:The cost to the Government will be determined to be fair and reasonable in accordance with criteria   *8.  Description of the market survey that was conducted (i.e. names of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:From the literature and trade shows, there are only two vendors capable of providing a chip based method of measuring on the order of one million DNA polymorphisms per assay.  These vendors are Affymetrix and Illumina.  Both vendors are actually participating in this project (see below).Personnel from VA Central office have visited both vendors.  There are differences some between chips; for example the Affymetrix chip also allows for looking at copy number of some genes*9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as  an explanation as to why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statement of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for competition have not been developed or are not available.This array is the only DNA Chip available that combines 900,000 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and946,000 non-polymorphic copy number probes (CNPs) for genome-wide association studies.We need to use Affymetrix for this contract because part of the goal of this project is to compare the Affymetrix and Illumina platforms.   It is unclear as to which platform will perform better for conducting this type of analysis.  The equipment necessary performs the analysis on the Illumina platform exists at the VA genomics laboratory.   VA Central Office is funding this laboratory to analyze the samples on the Illumina platform.  The Affymetrix chip analysis conducted on the same samples will be contracted out to Affymetrix (this PO request.  The equipment to perform the analysis on the Affymetrix platform does not currently exist within the VA and as outline above (question 6) Affymetrix has the expertise and capacity to provide the high volume, high quality scientific results and assure appropriate data security Comparison of the data obtained using the two platforms, will be informative as to the which platform will perform better in future large scale genomic studies within the VA research.*10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed an interest in the acquisition:None to date*11.  A statement of the actions, if any, that the department/service may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies/services is required in the future:Contracting Activity will continue to encourage full and open competition whenever possible.

Description
The Defense Acquisition Challenge (DAC) Program was established by Congress (Chapter 139 of Title 10 USC, 2359b) to increase the introduction of innovative and cost-saving technologies and products into existing Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition programs. The DAC Program is managed through the Office of Secretary of Defense (Acquisition Technology & Logistics), Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Advanced Systems & Concepts), Comparative Testing Office. DAC provides any person or activity within or outside the DoD the opportunity to propose alternative technologies and product improvements. Opportunities known as Challenge Proposals proposed at the component, subsystem, or system level of an existing DoD acquisition program, will be evaluated for resulting improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of that acquisition program.  DAC Proposals will be evaluated under the guidelines and criteria outlined in Title 10 USC Section 2359b, Defense Acquisition Challenge Program. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is open to any technologies, products, or processes demonstrating a near-term potential to improve existing DoD acquisition programs that address the specific operational areas outlined below. Preference will be given to those technologies and products that challenge an incumbent and have the potential to be evaluated in less than 24 months from project selection, with near-immediate transition to operations/production at the completion of evaluation. To meet this time-line the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of proposed technologies or processes must be TRL 7 (prototype demonstrated in a relevant or operational environment) at time proposed, and TRL 8 or 9 (qualified through testing or ready for production) by completion of DAC testing. The following operational areas will be considered by DAC for US Army, US Air Force, US Navy and Marine Corps, US Special Operations Command, or other Defense Agencies: 1). Warfighter enhancements that specifically address improved warfighter effectiveness (e.g., lethality, accuracy, endurance); improved warfighter survivability (e.g., protection, agility, stealth, medical); improved warfighter force protection (e.g., defensive systems, detection, armoring, chem-bio defense); and improved warfighter sustainability (e.g., lighter equipment, combined equipment, longer missions, better batteries). 2). Direct warfighter support that specifically addresses logistics (e.g., supply chain management in the field, equip reliability); teaming (e.g., Net/Information Centric Operations at the tactical/operational level); surveillance, tagging and tracking (e.g., blue and hostile forces tracking, friendly identification). 3). Warfighter employment that specifically addresses planning capabilities (e.g., large unit employment); coordinating capabilities (e.g., Net/Information Centric Operations at the strategic level); transport capabilities (e.g., getting to/from the fight); and operational readiness (e.g., equip availability, maintainability, training). 4.) Other proposals that support our national strategy.  Proposals that specifically address solutions for acquisition programs experiencing a Nunn-McCurdy breach will be given special consideration if they address any design, engineering, manufacturing or technology integration issue causing said breach and satisfy all other DAC legislative requirements identified in Title 10.  Additionally, appropriate priorities will be given to those proposals from businesses that are not major contractors with the DoD.  The evaluation of proposals will be conducted in two phases. In the FIRST PHASE, any person or activity within or outside the DoD interested in participating must submit a proposal via the website: https://cto.acqcenter.com  and attach a Quad Chart using the most current Quad Chart format under Reference Materials on the website. All proposals received will be subjected to peer and review panels. Evaluation criteria for selection in this phase include at a minimum: (A) whether the proposal has merit; (B) whether the proposal is likely to result in improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability at the component, subsystem, or system level of an acquisition program; (C) whether the proposal could be implemented in the acquisition program rapidly, at acceptable cost and acceptable disruption. Proposals that meet the requirements as outlined above, and any additional evaluation criteria deemed appropriate for source selection, will be prioritized based on potential for providing innovative and cost-saving technologies or products into existing DoD acquisition programs and ability to meet warfighter needs. If not identified in the proposal, the acquisition program of record (POR) that can be identified as the most likely to benefit from the proposed technology or product will be asked to conduct a review of the proposal submitted in this First Phase. The associated DoD Program Manager, in collaboration with the prime system contractor on the program as appropriate, will decide whether to accept the proposal and further refine/develop the proposal for submittal as a Final Proposal. The acquisition program manager who reviews and accepts the initial submittal is responsible for submittal of the Final Proposal during the SECOND PHASE. The acquisition program manager will determine the scope of the DAC project to include action as a validation test or a comparative test based on market evaluation, acquisition best practices and program need.  In this second phase the Final Proposals submitted by program managers compete for DAC funding to test the proposed technology. In addition to the required areas on the initial proposal, the Final Proposal must include: key performance parameters (those the technology/product/process must meet); test concept and schedule for the test planning, administration, and data analysis; a plan for integration (to include cost and schedule) of the technology or product into the acquisition program; estimated vendor support costs; test article cost; projected facility/laboratory/test range costs; Quad Chart and a Project Chart with cost profile for the test and evaluation of the technology/product/process for the intended application. The integration plan must include all applicable certifications (safety, flight worthiness, insensitive munitions, operational utility, etc.) required to insert the product/technology/process into the acquisition program. Letter(s) from the acquisition authority expressing intent to procure, or the weapon system prime expressing intent to incorporate, pending successful testing, are required with the Final Proposal. By law, DAC funds cannot be used to implement/field the technology or product.  At the completion of the Second Phase a Government-led evaluation team will review all competing Proposals and assess each against the evaluation criteria set forth in Title 10, USC Section 2359b and all required Federal Acquisiton Regulation (FAR) criteria for source selection. The Second Phase Government review of the Proposals will include all criteria listed above, as well as: (A) an assessment of the cost, ease, and likelihood of adopting the challenge proposal and implementing it in the acquisition program; and (B) consideration of any intellectual property issues associated with the Challenge Proposal. Proposals will be selected for funding based on their assessment rating and the availability of Government funding. Selection for funding is highly competitive. Every attempt will be made to ensure that all submitters are notified of the outcome of their proposal(s). Final FY2010 selections are expected to be finalized NLT 1 October, 2009. All submissions into the Defense Acquisition Challenge website must be UNCLASSIFIED. Classified submissions, up to SECRET, can be accepted through the mail. Classified responses must be appropriately marked, sealed and mailed in accordance with classified handling procedures. Classified proposals must adhere to the same Proposal and Quad Chart formats provided on the website. For classified submittals, send an email to defensechallenge@osd.mil. Mailing instructions will be provided at that time. Classified documents must be mailed and received by the applicable due date and time. Classification does not in any way eliminate the offeror requirement to comply with all instructions in the BAA. Notification of rejections will be emailed to the Proposal submitter. It should be generally assumed that the reason a proposal was not considered for further review was due to failure to meet the requirements for DAC. This should not be construed as a commitment by the Government, and any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information or otherwise compensate/ reimburse for the information solicited. Persons submitting proposals are advised that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the government to any agreement involving expenditure of government funds. While this BAA and evaluation process meet the requirements for fair and open competition, the final determination will reside with the DoD contracting officer from the Sponsoring organization. Proposals must be received/ submitted via the DAC website NLT 2000 hours EST, 13 February 2009. Proposals submitted after the deadline will have to be submitted as an UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL and may result in the proposal not being considered for funding during the initial selection cycle. All Proposal submissions must comply with the Submission Guidelines and use the templates provided on the website. Failure to comply with the above instructions may result in the rejection of the proposal during the administrative review.  The agency posting this announcement, Washington Headquarters Services/ Acquisition and Procurement Office, is not responsible for the DAC program and therefore cannot answer submitter questions or accept proposals.

<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>Special Operations Command Central (SOCCENT) currently uses McAfee Endpoint Encryption. McAfee uses powerful encryption and strong access control to prevent unauthorized access to your sensitive data and stop its loss. This is imperative to the integrity of Department of Defense systems.</p>
<p>Endpoint Encryption offers two forms of encryption to protect data from unauthorized access wherever it is stored or travels:<br />&bull; Full-disk encryption helps ensure that information remains secure when it's stored on desktops, laptops, tablets, and other mobile devices <br />&bull; File and folder encryption lets you control which specific file types and folders are encrypted-and ensure they stay encrypted regardless of where they are saved using Persistent Encryption Technology<sup>TM</sup> <br />With both encryption types, encryption happens transparently and "on the fly," with virtually no system performance degradation. There's also no user interaction or training required. As a result, you never miss a beat to keep your data protected.<br />When users start up their PCs, they are met with strong two-factor authentication before their computers complete booting. These two factors could be the combination of a password challenge and possession of a smart card or token. Other authentication options are also available. Thanks to single sign-on, once users authenticate, they have unfettered access to the information they need to do their jobs efficiently.<br />Through powerful encryption and strong access control, your data is now protected against unauthorized use. To demonstrate this fact to others and to meet industry and government compliance requirements, Endpoint Encryption also offers extensive auditing and reporting capabilities.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address to below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolutions.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  A written proposal will be issued.  The solicitation number is W912EQ-09-R-0003. This acquisition is issued as a request for Proposal. This acquisition is set aside 100% for small businesses. The associated NAICS code is 541620 with a size of $7.0M. The following is a list of contract line item number(s): CLIN 0001: Rivervale Outlet Ditch Mussel Survey Task 1; CLIN 0002  Rivervale Outlet Ditch Mussel Survey Task 2.<BR>  <BR>Contractors shall submit a lump sum quotation to include all chargers. The government intends to evaluate proposals based on technical capabilities, personnel qualification, past performance and price related factors. Quotes may be submitted in hard copy or electronically, either through regular mail, email, or by facsimile. Regardless of the method of delivery, it is the offerors responsibility to ensure receipt of quotes by the time and date stated herein. STATEMENT OF WORK: The Contractor shall provide all personnel and equipment required to perform work that may include, but not be limited to, the following work items in accordance with specific task orders issued by the Contracting officer:<BR><BR>1. The Contractor shall, within 30 days after issuance of a task order, conduct surveys (qualitative and/or quantitative) in a manner agreed upon in each task order to determine the presence/absence of endangered mussels, provide density estimates of endangered mussels, translocate populations of endangered mussels, and provide other services that may be required by the Memphis District relating to endangered mussel populations.  Variables such as weather, flood events or other unforeseen circumstances may delay implementation of work without penalty to the contractor.  <BR><BR>Task 1.<BR><BR>a.  Quantitative sampling of approximately 5.2 miles of Rivervale Outlet Ditch, located north of Marked Tree, Arkansas.  The average width of this ditch is 80 feet.  The Memphis District has proposed to cleanout portions of this ditch.  The federally endangered freshwater mussel Potamilus capax was recently collected in this ditch during a preliminary reconnaissance survey. Quantitative sampling will include a sufficient number of replicate samples to adequately estimate population densities of both T&E species and non-endangered mussels. The report shall include number and location (GPS data) of all P. capax collected during the survey and a population estimate for P. capax for the area surveyed.<BR><BR><BR>b.  If during the course of formal consultation between the Memphis District USACE and the USFWS it is decided that translocation of endangered mussels is required, the contractor will be responsible for collecting and moving any endangered mussels found in the reach.  When translocating endangered mussels, sufficient personnel will be present to collect the required numbers of the target species from the reach.  Techniques employed will ensure maximum coverage of the substrate.  For example, personnel may be deployed in a line perpendicular with the channel in such a manner as to have a six-inch overlap in their survey area.  In this manner, the entire substrate can be covered without gaps.  Specific requirements relating to translocation will be described in the Biological Opinion supplied by the USFWS.  Translocation reports will include total number collected, mortalities (if any), GPS data on translocation sites, numbers placed at each site (if appropriate), the number of trips the contractor made to transport the mussels, average time to transport the mussels, temperature of water, and average water depths.  <BR><BR>Task 2.<BR><BR>The Memphis District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is proposing to build a 1,640 cfs pump station to divert water from the White River near DeValls Bluff in Monroe County Arkansas for agricultural irrigation purposes.  An Environmental Impact Statement and Environmental Assessment have previously been completed on the overall Grand Prairie Area Demonstration Project (GPADP), and a previous study conducted in 2001 by Miller et al., found no endangered freshwater mussels within the survey reach.  However, due to the length of time since that survey, and additional concerns regarding alterations to current velocities, changes in water elevations, and other potential hydrologic impacts, an additional study is needed.   <BR><BR>Study Area:  The study area for this survey will encompass two mussel beds in the vicinity of DeValls Bluff, Arkansas.  Figure 1 shows the location of the survey reach. <BR>The two mussel beds in the White River are approximately 625 M2 (upstream bed) and 1500 M2 (downstream bed).<BR><BR>Objective:  The objective of this study will be to conduct quantitative and qualitative surveys on two mussel beds in the vicinity of the proposed GPADP pump station. Information gathered in this effort will be used during the project monitoring process to determine whether project operations are impacting the mussel community in the survey area.  A previous study (Harris 1989) found the endangered Lampsilis abrupta present in the downstream mussel bed.  The initial monitoring effort (2005) found evidence of Potamilus capax (shells) but encountered no live specimens.  <BR><BR>Methodology and Sites:  An inter-agency team made up of Bill Posey (AGFC), Joe Krystofik and Chris Davidson (USFWS), Corps personnel, and a private industry malacologist met at DeValls Bluff, Arkansas and determined the sampling methods and areal extent of the survey.  Both quantitative and qualitative sampling will be conducted on the known mussel beds (Figure1). <BR><BR>Quantitative surveys will be conducted using a 0.25 meter quadrat.  At least 1% of the total area of each bed will be quantitatively sampled.  Each sample will consist of all material within the quadrat to a depth of 15 centimeters.  This material will be transported to the surface, processed through a sieve, and all unionids will be collected.   Mussels will be identified, enumerated, and returned to the approximate point of collection.  The lengths of the beds will be measured and the upstream and downstream limits of the beds will be delineated in decimal degrees using a GPS unit.  Spot dives will be conducted on the beds in order to estimate species richness.  At least fifteen, 15-minute dives will be conducted on each mussel bed.<BR><BR>General Contractor Requirements.<BR><BR>1.Coordination:  To the maximum extent possible, coordination will be done by telephone.   When in the field, the Contractor will submit a daily status report and dive schedule for the next day.  A safety meeting will be conducted prior to the start of work.  Site visits will be arranged for inter-agency team members and the Corps Dive Coordinator(if required) while surveys are being conducted.  The Contractor may be required to attend meetings with Corps and other resource agencies in Memphis, TN  to discuss scope of work, sampling locations, survey status, etc.<BR>2. Schedule and Deliverables:  <BR>All work shall be completed not later than _____.   Note: If required, a dive safety plan must be approved prior to start of fieldwork.  Site specific plan shall be submitted with Contractors proposal.<BR><BR>a.  Written assessments for environmental impact statements, environmental assessments, and biological assessments or other project documents.<BR><BR>b.  Preparation of technical reports containing results of work items accomplished under this contract.<BR><BR>Tasks to be performed are in partial fulfillment of the Memphis Districts obligations under the Endangered Species Act of 1973; as amended, and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.<BR><BR>Personnel Standards.  <BR>	<BR>a.

(End of provision) 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.   OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:     solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

 HSAR 3052.20970  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUN 2006).
 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions) 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

<DESC>Request for Information 4, 4 Dec 08
GENERAL STATEMENTS
The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this RFI nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. Any Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued electronically and will be posted on the FedBizOpps web site at www.fbo.gov.
The construction effort to build the MILCON facility that will house the Research Altitude Chambers is already underway.  For this reason the Government makes no promise to have any changes made to the facility. However, your feedback is extremely valuable in assessing any potential impacts to system integration with the MILCON facility as a result of the facility constraints.  We understand that your specific designs are not complete and the results of this interchange of information are not contractually binding to any party.  As you provide responses we ask that you are as specific as possible (e.g., statements like In order to reduce risk of installation problems and testing of the completed system, an estimate is that the minimum exterior door size of ___ feet by ___ feet is required are preferred versus The door size may be too small.).
In addition to the facility constraints provided in the MILCON coordination document, there shall be no on-site external hydrostatic testing of the chambers nor is it allowable that a previously tested chamber be disassembled and re-assembled on-site because these options present unacceptable risk.  Please keep this additional constraint in mind in your planning efforts.
As time is of the essence, industry answers are requested by COB Wednesday, 12 Dec 08.

<DESC>PLEASE NOTE CHANGE TO LAST PARAGRAPH
This public announcement is being issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.1.3.12.  This is not a request for proposals, and unsolicited proposals will not be accepted.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, or will the Government pay for information received as a result of this solicitation.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently considering an effort utilizing highly specialized and skilled engineering and technical resources to design, develop, test, implement, deploy and support its Time-Based Flow Management (TBFM) system, which is a planned initiative to enhance the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) decision support tool.  TMA is currently used by Traffic Management Specialists to optimize the flow of aircraft into capacity-constrained areas using time based separation, otherwise known as metering.  TBFM will build upon existing TMA functionality to fulfill user operational needs and Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) commitments.  PURPOSEThe purpose of this market survey is to assess market interest in the above stated requirement, and assess the capabilities of potential offerors through Industry responses.  The responses to this market survey will be used to determine industry interest and capabilities for improving and enhancing the time based metering capabilities of TMA.
The information gathered from this survey will be used to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside competition, in whole or in part, among small businesses and/or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. Small businesses are requested to submit a Business Declaration Form (see attached).  This effort employs The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology).  This restricts small businesses to a size standard of no more than 500 employees.  A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey does not exclude the vendor from competition.  
Submission requirements and instructions are provided in Attachment 1 to this survey.  Respondents are required to complete the Business Declaration Form at Attachment 2.  A draft TBFM Statement of Work is included at Attachment 3.
All responses to this Market Survey should be received no later than December 30, 2008.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  Interested parties with questions are encouraged to submit questions to the TBFM Questions & Answers website at: 
www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/systemops/prog/tbfm/
Your questions must be submitted no later than December 22, 2008.  No more questions accepted after this date.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The National Cancer Institute intends to procure the services of the Battelle Memorial Institute, 505 King Avenue, Columbus, OH 43201 for this new requirement.

The sole source acquisition is justified under the statutory authority contained in 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) and the following authority contemplated by FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2).  When supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for.  We could not locate another contractor with validated experience and security clearance in the very specific process of performing an aerosol spore challenge of Bacillus anthracis that is classified as a Category A human pathogen and is subject to strict Federal Control measures. Battelle Labs in Columbus, OH is the only place capable of performing the work of the SOW (investigating an NCI vaccine candidate against anthrax in a BSL-3 facility capable of handling aerosol anthrax) in a testing facility that meets government and safety requirements, and where the results will be interpretable with prior data and thus satisfactorily meet the governments objectives.  Battelle lab has limited space for rabbit experiments of the type required by this SOW, and research facilities from across the country are requesting use of these particular Battelle facilities.

The contract will be issued on a sole-source basis to Progeny since the terms of an existing contract with Progeny prevent the Government from releasing or disclosing SBIR-specific data relative to Progenys COTS Technology Infusion process and procedure for five years after completion of the project under which the data was generated. Access to this data is necessary for the current procurement. The contract will include Cost Plus Fixed-Fee provisions with an estimated Level of Effort of (116,400) hours. This contract Statement of Work requires engineering services including technology assessment, mechanical and electrical component analysis, hardware/software development and integration, critical item testing, certification and test, and life cycle logistics studies necessary for the testing and evaluation, prototype and Engineering Development Model (EDM) components of torpedo systems.  The period of performance will be for five years.  Any interested party may submit an offer which will be considered. See Note 22. Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed at our web site:

http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.  We also provide electronic access in our Bid Room.

<DESC>WPJ-08-0894  PERIMETER IMPROVEMENTS PROJECT, NEBRASKA AVENUE COMPLEX (NAC), 3801 NEBRASKA AVENUE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC  
 
CBD Notice posted on September 11, 2008 is hereby amended to change the solicitation issuance date from September 30, 2008 to October 15, 2008 and RFP due date from October 30, 2008 to November 17, 2008.

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity to procure 
services of a highly qualified construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment necessary for an overall security enhancement of both physical spaces and security equipment in and around the perimeter of a campus of federal office buildings which is located on a 38 acre complex in Northwest Washington, DC. This complex is commonly known as the Nebraska Avenue Complex (NAC).

GSA intents to award a firm-fixed price contract utilizing Source Selection procedures 
that represents the best value to the Government, as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15.  Under this Source Selection, non-price factors are significantly more important than price.

This procurement is not set-aside for small businesses.  However, this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Women-owned businesses are encouraged to submit bids and so state that they are women-owned.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) issuance date is October 15, 2008; and the RFP due  
date is November 17, 2008.   GSA is issuing this solicitation electronically and on CD-ROM.  You may access the RFP documents at the Federal Business Opportunity Website Home Page at http://www.FEDBIZOPPS.gov.  However, the construction project drawings will be available on CD-ROM only.  Potential offerors may pick-up a CD-ROM copy of the construction project drawings on October 15, 2008 at the General Services Administration, National Capital Region, Regional Office Building, Bid Room, Room 1065, 7th & D Streets, SW, Washington, DC.  Please reference Solicitation Number WPJ-08-0894 when requesting the bid documents and drawings. 

Construction completion and final acceptance is expected to occur within 25 months after 
a notice to proceed (NTP). GSA is planning to award this contract in early 2009.

The estimated cost for the project is between $15,000,000 and $25,000,000 dollars.

This project will include major renovations and demolition of several buildings located at the NAC. There will also be construction of new guard booths, vehicle screening building, upgraded fencing and electronic security equipment used to monitor the site. This is a turnkey project.

Due to the substantial amount and complexity of electronic equipment required on the project it is expected that the Prime Contractor will have as a part of their team, a technology systems integrator, security specialist, AV and IT specialists. Some portions 
of the technology systems will be required to be certified by the Underwriters Laboratory (UL).  Therefore, appropriate parties of the team of technology subcontractors will be required to have applicable UL certifications.

Interested Offeror(s) must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, which has successfully and satisfactorily completed projects of similar complexity, scope, and size, or which has similar projects currently under construction.

Offeror(s), individually or as a team, must have the capacity to obtain performance and payment bonding for up to 100% of the firm-fixed price.  

While the contractors personnel will have to satisfy the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 the Government does not anticipate that any special security clearance (i.e. TOP SECRET) will be required to participate in this procurement.

The RFP will require the proposals be submitted in a two volume set.  Volume I will be the Technical Proposal and Volume II will be the Pricing Proposal.  The selection process will utilize source selection procedures in accordance with the FAR Part 15.  The selection process will use tradeoffs.  Non-price factors are significantly more important than the price related factors.  The technical proposals evaluation (non-price) factors are as follows: Capabilities/Experience (33%), Past Performance (25%), Technical Approach (22%), and Small Disadvantaged Business Participation (20%).

Offerors will be required to address Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) considerations in 
the technical portion of their proposals.  Offerors shall provide a SDB Participation Plan that outlines their targets, expressed as dollars and percentage of the total contract value, in each 
of the applicable, authorized NAICS Industry Subfactor, and a total target for SDB participation by contractor, including joint venture partnership, and team members, and a total for SDB participation by subcontractors.

YOU ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF UPLOAD OF THE RFP AT THIS SITE AND REGISTER ON THE INTERESTED VENDOR LIST (IVL).  

THERE WILL BE NO PUBLIC BID OPENING.
