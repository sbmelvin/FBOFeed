<DESC>PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; BIDS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.     This solicitation is issued as Request for Proposal No. 2002-N-00300.  This procurement is being issued as a 100% small business set aside under the NAICS code # 334519 with a size standard of 500 employees.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-02. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  (NIOSH),  in Morgantown, WV has a requirement for 100 Portable Hand-Held Spirometers.   BACKGROUND: NIOSH has an ongoing study entitled  "Workplace Exacerbation of Asthma."    Phase II, Validation Study, of this project will involve NIOSH lending commercial portable hand-held spirometers to the contractor for collecting serial forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR).  Subjects with and without workplace exacerbation will be requested to conduct serial spirometry over a 3 week period.  The findings will serve as the "gold standard" to determine the sensitivity and specificity of a self-report of workplace exacerbation of asthma.  Prior to the serial spirometry, the contractor will test subjects pre- and post-bronchodilator using NIOSH-approved methods.  This data will provide a measure of the extent of the reversibility of airway obstruction, and the post-bronchodilator FEV1 value will serve as a denominator for summarizing the serial FEV1 measurements as the percentage of a personal best value.  After completion of the pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry, the contractor will instruct subjects in the proper use of the hand-held spirometers and ask the subjects to conduct several trial blows as proof of their ability to use the device.  The subjects will be asked to use the hand-held spirometers during the following 3 weeks for at least 16 days.  Each day the subjects will be asked to complete five trials: first thing on getting up, morning break, before lunch, before dinner, and at bedtime.  Three acceptable blows will be requested for each trial.  In addition, subjects will be asked to indicate when and where they were at each trial, recent medication use, and whether they were having trouble with respiratory symptoms.  The contractor will provide subjects a local telephone number (or toll-free number if long-distance) to call and ask for assistance.  At the end of each week of testing, the contractor will call the subject to confirm that everything is going well and to provide a reminder about downloading data from the spirometer.   The downloaded data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the contractor to identify problems with compliance or performance.  Results from a micro-based portable spirometer with maneuver quality checks is preferable to using traditional mechanical PEF meter.   The devices will be checked for accuracy and reliability before and after use by a technician in the NIOSH Pulmonary Function Support Laboratory.   SPECIFICATIONS:  This procurement action is to acquire 100 EACH of a HAND-HELD,  PORTABLE SPIROMETER including modem, cradle, telephone downloading, 3 year warranty, supplies, and customized software, in accordance with the following criteria/ specifications:   a) ultrasonic sensor for measuring pulmonary function;  b) measures FEV1, FEV6 or FVC, PEF;   c) NHANES III predicted normal values for basic spirometric measurements;  d) electronic storage of results for each acceptable blow; at least 3 best trials stored per session (although the intent is to have information downloaded every day, the unit must be able to hold, store and transmit up to a maximum of five (5) blows a day for a period of three (3) weeks);  e) telephone and PC downloading capability in electronic format;  f) programable to include o

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Michigan, Institute for Social Research, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105.  The project looks to establish the planning documentation and epidemiological sample frame for conducting a longitudinal study that disentangles the confounding effects of race and socio-economic status on long-term healthy aging.  The goal of this project will focus on creating new survey sampling methodologies and applications unique to a diverse and complex population, spanning numerous and various socio-economic patterns, with a particular focus on assessment made by a longitudinal study.  This study requires a detailed knowledge of the public health characteristics of this region and the ways in which we must collect racial and socioeconomic demographic data to assess their influence on a variety of health outcomes such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular functioning, psychophysioloigcal and cognitive performance, and muscular strength and conditioning.  This project will create the underlying planning documentation and epidemiological justificaitons for defining a sampling population and creating new survey sampling methods and applications required to perform  a scientifically valid longitudinal study.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued as a request for quotations (RML-RFQ-2008). The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27 (through 06/25/2001). This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a Small Business Set-Aside.  The associated North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) for this procurement is 325998 and the size standard is 500 employees.  SCHEDULE: The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis (LHBP) has a requirement for peptide libraries consisting of 19-amino acid, biotin-labeled peptides. The LHBP has identified, through genome-scale approaches, a large number of proteins involved in the pathogenesis of infections caused by Group A Streptococcus  (GAS).  These peptides will be used to identify specific regions of these proteins recognized by the host immune system with the long-term goal of identifying GAS vaccine candidates.  We anticipate the need to order an average of approximately 700 peptides per month for a period of 12 months.  It is mandatory that the peptide libraries purchased have the following features: 1) The individual peptides must be synthesized using multiple parallel synthesis on polyethylene pins in 8 x 12 96-sample blocks using multi-pin solid phase peptide synthesis technology to minimize costs and turn around time.  2) The resultant peptides must be biotinylated at the aminoterminus and must be synthesized with a 4-residue (S-G-S-G) spacer arm.  The synthesis technology must allow the peptides to be cleaved after synthesis on pins, synthesized in 1-5 mmol quantities, and supplied in the final form as lyophilized powder.  In addition, Mass Spectral Analysis must be performed on selected peptides as part of the quality control process.  3) The company that will supply  the peptide libraries must have the capability to synthesize and supply the peptide libraries within 4-5 weeks of the placement of the order.  FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Inside delivery shall be no more than 30 days after receipt of order (ARO).  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis and issue a modification to the existing contract (No. 50-DGNE-0-90069) with Honeywell Technologies Solutions (Honeywell) to extend the Period of Performance for item 3000 of the contract, Product Monitoring, an additional three (3) months (01/05/2002 through 04/04/2002), plus six (6) additional one-month options to be exercised if, and, as needed. This contract is in its second year option period and provides engineering analysis and navigation support services for the NOAA Office of Satellite Operations. The National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Services (NESDIS) operates all of the United States civil meteorological satellites from the Satellite Operations Control Center (SOCC), located in
Suitland, Maryland. The civil meteorological constellations consist of the Geostationary Orbiting Environmental (GOES) and Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) Spacecraft. The
GOES satellite programs provides continuous, dependable, timely, high-quality observations of the Western Hemisphere and geosynchronous space environment. The POES Satellites are in
polar, sun-synchronous orbits and provide operational coverage of the entire Earth four times each day. The data gathered from these satellites allows our country's weather and emergency agencies to monitor global climate change, verify ozone depletion and land surface change, monitor the critical space environmental parameters, and support search and rescue efforts across the globe.  This contract extension is necessary to provide manual product monitor support prior to the acceptance of the automated Rehosted Product Monitor which is nearing completion of development and testing. Any prospective offeror must demonstrate a cost and technical benefit to the Government in view of the short period of performance. Interested sources must also
submit a written narrative of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature, demonstrating the ability to provide the required services in sufficient to permit an agency analysis to determine a bona-fide capability to meet the Government's requirements, within 15 days of publication of this notice.  Responses without the required
documentation shall be considered non-responsive.  Telephonic responses shall not be accepted.
