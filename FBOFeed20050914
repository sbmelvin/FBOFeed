<DESC>MOTOROLA MOSCAD SYSTEM UPGRADE This is Sole Source procurement, synopsis published for informational purposes only. Solicitation documents are not available.  The proposed contract is for a Motorola Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (MOSCAD) System for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  The proposed source is Motorola, Inc.  The description is a Fire Station Alerting System with two-way communications (both send and receive) to match up with existing Motorola CENTRACOM Gold Elite Radio System at three locations on Wright-Patterson AFB.  The government anticipates a sole source award to Motorola, Inc because Motorola MOSCAD software is the only approved software that can be installed that is compatible with the Motorola Dispatch software which is currently installed on the radio system and connecting to any other manufactures equipment would void the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) listing for the MOSCAD system as a whole.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the government will consider all quotations/responses received within five (5) days of the issuance of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this acquisition. The ASC Ombudsman is Stephen J. Miller, ASC/AE, 1755 Eleventh St, B570, R113, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH  45433-7404 (Phone:  937-255-5315; FAX 937- 656-7193; E-Mail stephen.miller@wpafb.af.mil).  Any quotation/response should be faxed to Steve Godby, 88 CONS/PKBA, 937-656-1412, or e-mailed to Steve.Godby@wpafb.af.mil no later than 26 Aug 05.

<DESC>General Services Administration (GSA) Lease No. LAZ94479 provides 25,262 rentable square feet of contiguous office and related area in a 30-story building with a 6-level secure underground parking garage for 18 official vehicles.  GSA is interested in considering alternative space if relocation is economically advantageous to the Government.  In making such a determination, GSA will consider cost factors including, but not limited to, the total cost of the physical move (including telecommunications and computer cabling costs); tenant improvement costs (whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent); and anticipated rent for the space.  Of particular importance is space configuration to support a sophisticated IT infrastructure with satellite capability, as well as excellent security that is able to provide lockdown and limited floor and office access as warranted.  Proximity to employee services, such as moderately priced restaurants, banks, public transportation, and a fitness center, as well as hotel accommodations for visitors is also necessary.  Other factors impacting the Government's rights under a prospective lease, such as the length of any firm term that may be required at an alternative location, length of time necessary to deliver occupancy-ready space, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term, will also bear.

Space must be located in the Central Business District in Phoenix and within these boundaries: North-Camelback Road; South-Jefferson Street; East-7th Street; and West-7th Avenue; further bounded by North-Van Buren Street; South-Jefferson Street; East-7th Street; and West-Interstate 17.  Space must meet the Federal Government's standards for fire safety, be capable of being fully accessible to the physically challenged and be located outside a 100-year floodplain.  Space must be ready for occupancy on August 12, 2006 or sooner.  A lease term of 10 years with a firm term of 5 years is sought.

Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building's ownership.  If you desire to submit a location for inspection, please forward information by 5:00 PM EDT, September 30, 2005.  Expressions of interest should include building name and address, location of space in the building, rentable square feet offered and rentable rate per square foot (specifying services and utilities included), ANSI/BOMA defined usable square feet, percentage of common area factor used to determine the rentable square feet, one-eighth inch scale drawing of space offered, and contact information for owner or authorized agent.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) for the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Mrs. Mary Anne Glitz, 521 Greenwich Street, Falls Church, Virginia 22046, to continue to provide services to perform various contract administration duties in the NIDA/NIH Contracts Office.  Mrs Glitz has gained an in-depth knowledge of the NIH and federal regulations for pre-award and post award administration duties during her previous employment with the federal Government as a Contracting Officer (CO) and her experience preparing pre-decisional documents for SBIR awards.  Both as a federal CO and as a private contractor, Mrs. Glitz has analyzed direct and indirect cost proposals, worked with contractors and federal program and contracting staffs and thoroughly used the Federal Acquisition Regultions and NIH procedural guidance on the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) process.   The purpose of these contract is to have cost analysis advisory services performed for regular and SBIR awards  and complex contact modification to enable the Contract Management Branch (CMB) specialists to continue making award funding decisions.  The NIDA Contracts Management Branch has responsibilities that include making new contract awards supporting NIDA’s biomedical and behavioral research missions.  Mrs. Glitz will be responsible to continue the performance of the tasks as outlined on the following Statement of Work: 1) Pre-Award processing steps on SBIR Phase I and II Contract Projects. The contract Support contractor must use senior level, working knowledge of the SBIR contracts program and perform process steps and prepare necessary associated documentation.  Most customarily, this will include performing independent costs analyses and recommending pr-negotiation objectives.  The contract Support contractor also must draft documents for NIDA staff to send to prospective research contractors initiating and concluding negotiations.  This also includes drafting recommended award documents, using NIH standard contract generation documentation tools.  Various file memo and other letters and memoranda for NIDA staff also must be prepared.  Samples of many standard memos will be provided, but senior level analyses and initiates are vital for full performance.  Similar actions on non-SBIR actions also may be required.  2) Post-Award, Complex contract modifications and support documents.  The Contract Support contractor must draft for review and signature by the NIDA Contracting Officer various bilateral change orders, cost overrun settlements, PBS award fee determinations, actions revising funding levels, etc.  The contract Support Contractor also must compare and analyze billed costs vs previously negotiated costs, prepare EXCEL spreadsheet data entry comparisons, and make recommendations to the NIDA Contracting Officer on most appropriate actions course.  The Contract Support Contractor then must analyze the negotiated vs actual direct effort devoted on appropriate term form contracts to see if the research contractors provided all required effort on those contracts.  The contract Support Contractor shall prepare closing documents (samples to be provided by NIDA) on overhead rates and obtain certifications/releases from the research contractors.  3) Processing research contractor’s financing requests.  The Contract Support Contractor must examine invoices against existing contract terms (examining contractual cost ceilings/advance understandings, contracting Officer Authorizations, compare billings against other previous bills and contract terms, coordinate review paperwork performed by NIDA Program Officials, and make a recommendation to the NIDA Contracting Officer concerning payment in full, partial payment, or full invoice suspension.  Following the review, the Contract Support contractor must enter invoice data into: (1) EXCEL; and (2) NIDA Contract Administration Tracking System databases and file the paperwork into appropriate contract folders.  4) Processing contractors’ special approval requests. The Contracts Support contractor must examine contract terms for any applicable coverage, analyze the projected cost impact, and coordinate paperwork with NIDA Program Officials, the NIH property office, Information technology staf, and others as directed.  Following the review and coordination, the Contract Support Contractor must draft any appropriate approval/rejection letters, and file copies of such in appropriate contract folders.  
5) Review/Action on delinquent deliverables.  The Contract Support Copntractor must draft miscellaneous correspondence to Program Officials and/or Contractors as directed, using samples NIDA will provide on a variety of routine contract administration issues.  It then must update the NIDA Contract Administration Tracking System databae to reflect such actions.   6) Assorted support staff functions.  The Contract Support Contractor must perform miscellaneous jobs necessary to keep overall office paperwork work flowing within assigned deadlines.  This involves reconciling Federal and NIDA level reports on obligations and spending and attending and participating in meetings with NIDA program, review and budget staff to learn of specific assignments.  This could involve making entries in various NIDA or other Federal databases (e.g, CATS, NIDACIS, CPS, DCIS).  In order to maintain continuity of the work that has already been performed, award of a contract to any other source would result in duplication of effort and substantial expense to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Payment: Payment is to be made in periodic installments (not more frequently than every 2 weeks) based on hours performed.  The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561499, and Size Standard is $6.o Million.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.   Comments  to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLB-PS-2005-174-CDM  may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, Building RKL2, Suite 6149, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention Ms. Cecilia Morales, Contract Specialist.

BACKGROUND.  The US Air Force provides global civil engineering support activities through a variety of contract vehicles maintained by AFCESA and its sister field operating agency, the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE).  Current Air Force major contractual programs address environmental restoration, military family housing, contingency, and the military construction program (MILCON).  The SATOC represents the primary contract vehicle for AFCESA’s newly formed S/R&M program and primarily supports existing Air Force facilities and infrastructure.  The program supports a range of S/R&M efforts with both small (<$100K) and large task orders (>$5M) expected.

PROGRAM INFORMATION.  The SATOC contractual program will meet AFCESA customer requirements worldwide, including locations in remote, austere, and hostile environments.  The acquisition strategy contemplated is awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts with multiple pricing arrangements (i.e. Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee, (CPFF).  The anticipated total program ceiling is $10 billion over a ten-year period.  We anticipate awarding a number of contracts under full and open competition procedures, and 8(a) set-aside procedures.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 236220 with an applicable size standard of $28,500,000.  

We anticipate releasing the RFP on or about 25 Nov 05.  The RFP will be issued via the FedBizOps. http://www.EPS.gov

2.  What is your degree of relevant experience in providing the full range of delivery methods including design-build, design-build plus, turnkey, traditional, and concept/implementation work plan at both CONUS and OCONUS locations?

3.  We anticipate awarding multiple task orders simultaneously, possibly in 
geographical/diverse locations. Does your company have experience performing on simultaneous multiple task orders/contracts in various locations and conditions? 

4.  What is the minimum and maximum dollar value project on which your firm would routinely consider submitting a proposal?

5.  What is your bonding capacity for construction work?

6.  What is your business size? If you are a small business, do you also qualify under any of the sub-categories (small disadvantaged business, 8a, woman owned small business, HUB Zone small business, service disabled veteran owned small business, and HBCU/MI)?

7.  Are you interested in this requirement as a Prime Contractor, Joint Venture, or Sub-Contractor. 

8.  For this type of work, what are your actual percentages and dollars in subcontracting to small business and all-subcategories (small disadvantaged business, 8a, woman owned small business, HUB Zone small business, service disabled veteran owned small business, and HBCU/MI)?

9.  What are the most critical criteria that would distinguish one company’s capabilities from another?  What criteria do you recommend be used during evaluation? Explain.

Fair Opportunity provisions will not be applicable to the task order awards.  These IDIQ contracts will be awarded based on the following primary and secondary areas of performance:  (primary areas - 2 contracts for GA & FL, 1 contract for AL & MS, 1 contract for KY & TN and 1 contract for NC & SC; secondary areas - each primary area of performance not awarded to a successful CM will be considered as secondary geographical locations of performance.  However, consideration will be given to a firm's ability to provide service in the secondary areas of performance on an individual task order basis.  Each contract will consist of a base year, extending 365 calendar days from the date of contract award and four (4) additional one-year duration options to be issued at the discretion of the Contracting Officer for a potential total duration of 5 years.

The selection process will utilize source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 15.101-1. The primary objective of this process is to select the most technically qualified contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government when all factors including price are considered.  For this acquisition, technical/management factors are more important than price and price related factors. The evaluation factors will be outlined in the Request For Proposal (RFP).  Award without discussions is contemplated.  Therefore, offerors in responding to the RFP will be encouraged to submit all proposals on their best terms and conditions.

                                   EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>The Library of Congress Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division operate a full service motion picture conservation center located at Wright Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton Ohio. The primary purpose of the Center is to conserve, preserve, and restore the Library’s film archive, the largest of its kind in the United States. 

Being that the Dayton, Ohio facility is only equipped to produce copies of black and white motion pictures, it only makes sense that, due to the depth and diversity of the motion picture collections, we have as many tools on hand as is possible to attempt to accurately copy and preserve an art form who’s techniques and technologies are rapidly disappearing from the World motion picture markets.

It is the Library’s understanding that there is only one source of black and white motion picture film stock materials in the World and that is the German company, ORWO. Midridge Image Supplies Inc. is the sole United States distributor of said film stock(s), therefore the Library of Congress intends to purchase through a sole source the following items: 

1.	Orwo B&W, PF2 Plus AHU Positive Print Stock, Poly Base (2000 ft rolls).
2.	Orwo B&W DN21 Dupe Negative Stock w/AHU, Poly Base (2000 ft rolls).

Any other company/manufacturer that feels it is capable of and believes its film stock can meet all the above performance requirements can apply to the Library for consideration.   Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government must receive all such statements by close of business 12PM EST, Friday September 30, 2005 to be considered.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed Order (Contract) based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any information received from interested firms/manufacturers responding to this notice will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any questions regarding this Notice shall be in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer, Jackie R. Johnson, Jr. via email at jjohn@loc.gov.

<DESC>This is a SYNOPSIS under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) for Commercial Items Acquisition in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and 13. Solicitation No. N68711-05-R-8015, STREET SWEEPING AND HYDRO-CLEANING AT VARIOUS NAVAL FACILITIES LOCATED IN SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) and will be a single award Firm-Fixed Price and Indefinite Quantity contract. The performance period will include a base year and nine 12-month option periods. The solicitation is restricted to small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 562998 and the size standard is $6 million dollars. This solicitation incorporates FAR 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, and 52.212-5, and are attached to the solicitation. The following factors will be used to evaluate offers: Factor #1 Past Performance: Provide a list of contracts similar to the project description shown under the solicited contract, completed during the past 3 years. Contracts listed may include those entered into with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers. Provide the information on Attachment 9, “Past Performance Project Data Sheet” for each contract. Failure to use Attachment 9, “Past Performance Project Data Sheet” may result in a lower rating for this factor. Failure to provide a point of contact (POC) that is accessible, or a correct current phone number and fax number may result in a lower rating for this factor. If you are submitting a project your firm performed on as a subcontractor, the prime contractor may be cited as the point of contact. Evaluation of past performance will often be subjective. The evaluation of past performance will include the contractor’s history of reasonable and cooperative behavior, commitment to customer satisfaction, record of conforming to applicable law and industry standards (i.e., Service Contract Act Wage Determinations/Safety Standards, etc.); quality of workmanship, record of recommending and/or implementing innovative approaches and/or technologies; record of controlling costs; safety performance record, and adherence to schedules. The Government reserves the right to contact any other sources of information that may have knowledge or information on an offeror's relevant past performance history. Offers which demonstrate a lack of relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor. Any offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may not be competitive when compared to the proposals of the other offerors. Factor #2 Key Personnel, Vehicles, Equipment, and Experience: Identify offeror’s key personnel and their minimum job requirements and job experience. More weight will be given to offerors who demonstrate key personnel with more experience and job requirements as it relates to the performance work statement of this contract solicitation. Information may be provided on Attachment 12. Vehicles & Equipment: Provide information on vehicles and equipment to be used under this contract (e.g., type of vehicles and equipment, number of vehicles and equipment, age of vehicles and equipment, and if they are new or refurbished vehicles and equipment). More weight will be given to offerors who propose more reliable vehicles and equipment to be used under this contract. Use Attachment 13, “Vehicle & Equipment List” to submit information for evaluation. Experience: This section shall address the offeror’s experience with work similar to the project description shown under the basic solicitation Technical Section 1503060 specification 3.1 and Attachment 1503060-07. Offerors shall submit projects will have been performed or completed within the past five years, as of the closing date for receipt of proposals. More weight will be given to offeror’s who demonstrate experience for the following type of projects: a.) Airfield Pavement Sweeping b.)Steam Cleaning and Hydro-Scrub of miscellaneous structures. Use Attachment 8, “Experience Project Data Sheet” to submit projects for evaluation. Failure to use Attachment 8, “Experience Project Data Sheet” may result in a lower rating for this factor. Failure to provide all requested data, a point of contact (POC) that is accessible, or a correct current phone number and fax number, may result in a lower rating for this factor. Projects submitted, which are outside the five-year period specified, will be removed and discarded prior to evaluation. Factor #3 Price: The price proposal for the Base Period and all Option Periods, will be evaluated to determine the reasonableness, realism, and completeness of the offeror’s proposal. One or more of the following techniques will be used to ensure a fair and reasonable price: 1.) Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. 2.) Comparison of proposed prices with the independent Government estimate. 3.) Comparison of proposed prices with available historical information. 4.)Comparison of proposed prices with resources proposed. A price that is found to be either unreasonably high or unrealistically low in relation to the proposed work may result in the overall proposal being considered unacceptable. Any inconsistency whether real or apparent, between proposed performance and price must be clearly explained in the price proposal. For example, if unique and innovative approaches are the basis for an apparently unbalanced/inconsistently priced proposal, the nature of these approaches and their impact on price must be completely documented. The burden of proof of price realism rests solely with the offeror. Price Proposal Submission: The offeror shall complete and submit the following in the order shown below in a separate price proposal binder: 1)SF 1449. 2)Pavement Sweeping and Steam Cleaning and Hydro-Scrub Exhibits A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. 3)Attachment 11 Financial Questionnaire. Relative Importance of the Evaluation Factors: Factor 1 and 2 are of equal importance. When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1 and 2 are approximately equal to Factor 3. The importance of price will increase if offerors non-pricing proposals are considered essentially equal in terms of technical quality, or if price is so high as to significantly diminish the value of a proposal’s technical superiority to the Government. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered. Options:The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options. Written Notice: A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed, or otherwise furnished, to the successful offeror, within the time for acceptance in the offer, shall result in a binding contract, without further action from either party. Before the expiration date specified in the offer, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.THIS RFP WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD FREE OF CHARGE VIA THE INTERNET WORLD WIDE WEB AT http://esol.navfac.navy.mil ON OR ABOUT SEPTEMBER 23, 2005, AND CAN BE FOUND UNDER SOLICITATION/CONTRACT NUMBER N68711-05-R-8015.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service (USPS) has a requirement for the acquisition of a service for a web-based Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) National Excess Management System (NEMS) with minimal customizations for use by U.S. Postal Service personnel.  A COTS NEMS is a national database that must support the entry, listing and multiple disposition methods (i.e., sale, re-distribution, recycling, donation, scrap etc.) of excess material by multiple users at multiple locations with hierarchical user profiles.  NEMS must also support the financial tracking and reporting of listed assets.  NEMS COTS solutions are modular so a phased-in implementation program is possible, built around USPS business rules, and easily interfaced with existing postal legacy systems.  The selected supplier shall be responsible for the configuration, customization, testing, integration, deployment, and support of NEMS.  See attached.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Army Communications and Electronics Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC) is planning the release of  Request for Proposal (RFP) for the replacement of the Firefinder AN/TPQ-36(V)8 Radar Processor (RP), spare parts for the RP, an d technical, logistical and engineering support services.  The principal source of some current Firefinder AN/TPQ-36(V)8 performance problems lies in the RP, which performs the signal and data processing functions.  It is required that a replacement RP be designed to allow the radar system to meet the requirements which the current AN/TPQ-36(V)8 system fails to achieve and to allow for future upgrades.  The RP Replacement program will exploit the positive advantages of the AN/TPQ-36(V)8 while addressing som e of its performance shortfalls.  The programs objectives are to address current RP obsolescence issues, expedite a RP replacement that addresses AN/TPQ-36(V)8 performance in a clutter environment, provide RPs for Modularity fieldings and provide for futu re growth/expansion.  Spare parts are needed to sustain the replacement RPs.  Technical support is required, primarily to modify the software to improve performance in a clutter environment.

<DESC>Please note that in the second paragraph of the PIP PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION section, references to "51" have been changed to "xx" to correct a word processing error.  The paragraph now reads correctly, as follows:  
 
The AC program seeks to develop a software execution infrastructure for existing COTS programs.  This infrastructure will monitor and augment COTS application behavior so multiple active copies of application X running under the infrastructure behave as a self-aware Application-X-Community that: 1) collaboratively diagnoses problems (attacks/bugs/errors), 2) collaboratively responds to problems by generating appropriate configuration changes, patches, filters, etc., and 3) collaboratively generates a community-specific situation awareness gauge that predicts likelihood and timing of imminent problems.  Potential formulations for success metrics are:  1) for collaborative diagnosis: xx% accurate problem identification, localization, and diagnosis in xx minutes; 2) for collaborative response: generate effective patches/filters in xx minutes and prevent xx% of harmful patch/filter side effects; and 3) for situational awareness: predict likelihood and timing of problems with xx% accuracy and provide both a local and community-wide measure of risk.  In lieu of providing complete program success metrics up front, the AC program requests that AC researchers propose success metrics and the resources and time needed to achieve them.  AC researchers are encouraged to provide several alternatives making rational tradeoffs between research ambition and project length.  AC researchers should also identify where commercial investment in products and services is justified, in the event the proposed metrics are achieved.  The AC program seeks a small number of teams where each team covers all the technical areas and must include an integrator that can bring the resulting technology to market if the research is successful.  The program will test the hypothesis that a collaborative reliability and defense system for black-box COTS applications can be made mostly automatic and that application communities encompassing a greater diversity of users and environments are more resilient in the face of unanticipated errors and attacks.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled FORMATION FLYING TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES (RFI-541710-FF) and replaces that synopsis which was posted on September 1, 2005. Due date for response has been changed to October 31, 2005. CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771.  INTRODUCTION: NASA is currently compiling an integrated portfolio to represent the state of U.S. technology in the area of spacecraft formation flying.  In order to confine the scope of this call, it will cover only unique capabilities to enable spacecraft formation flying in the specific categories defined in Appendix A.  The portfolio will be export-controlled and may include supplements with proprietary or classified protections.   The means of collection will be through secure electronic submission of standard format data sheets, following the formats in Appendix B and possible short presentation at a workshop in a proprietary or non-proprietary setting, to be defined at a later date.  The chart formats can be adjusted as needed for convenience, distribution markings, etc., as long as all information is provided.  The workshop and associated information collected will be open only to U.S. Government civil servants, members of Federally-Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) who are representing the government, and members of the presenting organization.   It is anticipated that all submitted data sheets representing technologies at technology readiness level (TRL) 2 or above will be included in the collection, provided that submission requirements are met.  However, due to time constraints, it is possible that only a subset of those who request to present orally will be selected to present, based on current requirements, maturity, relevance to near-term requirements, and credibility.   Please carefully review Appendix A for the appropriate submission area, if there is more than one for a system-level technology area, then please select the best fit area.  We anticipate the following categories of submission: 1.  Export controlled and/or proprietary data, unclassified 2.  Unrestricted, unlimited distribution data, unclassified 3.  Data classified SECRET, collateral 4.  Data classified TOP SECRET, collateral 5.  Data classified SCI Be certain that your charts are appropriately marked with any and all applicable distribution restrictions.  If proprietary, for example, simply modify the charts as needed to use your company’s standard proprietary header and/or footer markings.  You may submit multiple technologies in one file, with a separate chart for each technology.  In such a case, the individual who enters the information will be listed as the point of contact, (POC) by default, so each technology chart should list an appropriate POC, if different from the submitter.  For UNCLASSIFIED submittals, follow the link  http://aaaprod.gsfc.nasa.gov/Project/loginNRA.cfm to submit.  You will be asked to request a username and password that you will use for submittal. Internet Explorer 6.0 and Netscape 7.0 are the preferred browsers. User name and password to perform electronic submission can be obtained by sending an e-mail to Lisa Kane at Lisa.M.Kane-Hager.1 “AT” gsfc.nasa.gov. (It may take a day or two to obtain the user account and password.) For SECRET COLLATERAL submittals, send an unclassified notification to Jesse “DOT” Leitner “AT” nasa.gov or phone message to 301-286-2630 (unclassified line) and then send by registered mail to  GSFC Security Office Code 240.1 NASA GSFC Greenbelt, MD 20771 For TOP SECRET or SCI submissions, contact Dr. Jesse Leitner at 301-286-2630 (unclassified line) or the email address above to arrange submission through appropriate channels.  For further information or clarification on any element of this RFI, please contact Dr. Leitner via the information provided above.   Submissions will be accepted until October 31, 2005, 5 pm EST.   DO NOT TRANSMIT ANY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ON THE WEB-BASED SUBMISSION SYSTEM. SUMMARY: With this RFI, NASA is requesting community participation in a U.S.-wide spacecraft formation flying technology portfolio generation. No procurement is planned as a result of this RFI, although responses may be considered in formulating NASA’s future strategic investments and other decisions. It is emphasized that the requested information is for preliminary planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, explicit or implied, that the Government will solicit any related procurement from responders or any other groups or individuals in the future. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by respondents in furnishing the requested information. NO AWARDS WILL BE GRANTED AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THIS RFI.  An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to negotiate on a Sole Source basis. The U.S. Government has an urgent need to acquire and maintain within the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) Ca-DTPA and Zn-DTPA (Calcium and Zinc Diethylenetriaminepentaacetate). Currently there is only one manufacturer with a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approved Ca-DTPA and Zn-DTPA to treat internal contamination from radioactive elements, Hameln Pharmaceuticals, Gmbh, of Hameln, Germany. Hameln Pharmaceuticals has been granted by the FDA Orphan Drug Exclusivity for a period of 7 years from the date of approval of the New Drug Application (NDA) which was August 11, 2004. In November of 2004 Hameln Pharmaceuticals signed an Exclusive License and Supply Agreement for their FDA Approved Ca-DTPA and Zn-DTPA with Akorn, Inc. of Buffalo Grove, IL for the marketing and distribution of both drugs in the United States and Canada.

The Government intends to enter into a sole source contract with Akorn, Inc of Buffalo Grove, IL. A commercial item award, resulting from a written RFP is anticipated. The anticipated award date is on or about November 15, 2005. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement by submitting a capabilities statement to Darrick A. Early at the e-mail address below by September 29, 2005. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis RFP-DHHS-ORDC-DDA-05-10 may be submitted to Darrick A. Early at (202) 205-5668 or in writing to darrick.early@hhs.gov. This proposed acquisition is subject to the availability of funds.

<DESC>The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), helps to ensure an end to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by increasing basic knowledge of the pathogenesis and transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, supporting the development of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, and supporting the development of vaccines and other prevention strategies.  The purpose of this planned acquisition is to seek a contractor to continue an ongoing quality assessment program for virologic assays performed on samples from subjects enrolled in DAIDS-sponsored multi-site clinical studies.  The Virology Quality Assurance (VQA) Program is critical to the scientific integrity of on-going and future studies concerning HIV diagnosis, disease progression, assessment of treatment, vaccine efficacy and other preventive measures.  The VQA has been in operation since 1988 and has developed and standardized quality control procedures for approximately 25 virologic assays used in DAIDS-sponsored clinical trials.  DAIDS is seeking capability statements from organizations capable of performing the following tasks:  (1) implement standards of performance for existing and newly developed virologic assays and assess the ability of Sites to successfully perform the assays; (2) conduct studies on the adaptation, standardization and application of new and existing virologic and biostatistic methodologies; (3) acquire, characterize, store, document and disburse quality control materials and reagents to include biohazardous materials and infectious agents; (4) disseminate Virology Quality Assessment technical and scientific data; (5) maintain computerized software systems that support the VQA Program; and (6) expand services to include additional Sites when necessary through exercise of Options.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITIES RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS AN 8(a) SET-ASIDE; 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE OR AS FULL AND OPEN. ALL SIZE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES. To ensure the validity and inter- and intra-laboratory comparability of virologic laboratory data obtained from DAIDS-supported clinical trials and HIV natural history studies, the contractor will continue a program for "Real-Time Assay Validation," where known quality control materials (QCMs) are tested by VQA-supported laboratories (Sites) in parallel with patient samples to ensure the validity of each assay “run.”  The contractor will also conduct a "Proficiency Testing" (PT) program, where unknown QCMs are tested by the Sites to periodically monitor Site assay performance.  The contractor will provide participating Sites with standardized reagents and controls for conducting research aimed at development and evaluation of virologic and statistical methodologies.  The VQA Program will serve current and future DAIDS-sponsored clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups (User Groups).  Currently supported User Groups include: the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG), the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG), the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS), the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), the Community Program for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA), the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), the Comprehensive International Program of Research on AIDS (CIPRA), the Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP), as well as other domestic and international individual grantees.  Collaborations are anticipated with CDC Global AIDS Program (GAP)-affiliated laboratories supporting the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) activities.  Currently, the VQA program serves approximately 55 domestic and 25 international Sites.  The base contract is expected to cover these 80 Sites.  Although the structure of the clinical trial networks is subject to change during the contract period, the changes are not expected to result in changes to the number of participating Sites in the base contract.  However, the Government anticipates a need to expand the number of Sites during the course of the contract, and such an increase in the contractor’s activities may be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as one or more Options in each of the contract years.  The work to be performed under this contract is currently being carried out by Rush Presbyterian – St. Luke’s Medical, under contract N01-AI-85354 and is expected to be completed on September 20, 2005.  All capability statements will be evaluated against related ability and experience for providing this type and magnitude of support; available qualified personnel; corporate experience and existing facilities and resources. It is anticipated that this contract will be for a 7-year period of performance and require an estimated 9 to 19 FTEs with expertise consistent with the operations of a project of this size and complexity. All interested organizations should submit two (2) copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above. Please respond as directed by Government-Wide Numbered Note 25 which states: “Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration, on each of the following qualifications: (1) Experience: An outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed and any in-house research and development effort; (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientist, engineers and technical personnel who may be assigned as a principal investigator and/or project officer; (3) Facilities: Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration. A statement regarding industry security clearance. Any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.” In addition, in accordance with Government-Wide Numbered Note 26, “Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.” No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK
“CASE TRACKING SUPPORT SERVICES”

INTRODUCTION
 
OALJ presides over formal hearings arising from over 80 separate labor-related statutes and regulations, with most of the work concerning the Black Lung Benefits Act and the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act.

OALJ judges and their support staff use the Case Tracking System (CTS) which is a “Case Management” solution to manage OALJ cases through their life cycle. The life cycle of an OALJ case starts with the initial filing, it then runs through to the rendering of a judges’ final decision which closes the case.  The CTS user has the ability to add and retrieve information related to cases such as documents served, case status and case location, etc.  The CTS produces a variety of management reports that provide case area managers with information pertaining to their caseloads.  

The current CTS system is composed of the following interrelated application modules that are GOTS products:

&#61607;	Web Access Application:  Provides the User interface to the Case Tracking Application and core functions of electronic case management, event tracking, queries, and reporting.
&#61607;	DMS: Web Application that issues a case document and its associated service sheet, creates the service sheet document, creates PDF electronic versions of the case document and service sheet and attaches the PDF files to the case record.  
&#61607;	Electronic Service:  Delivery of all judge issued documents electronically via e-mail to parties in OALJ cases with a secure link for pick-up of the document and service sheet.  These parties to the cases are both government and citizens.
&#61607;	Web File:  A collection of SQL Server Jobs that publishes Case Decision documents that are identified as being within FIOA regulations to be published to the OALJ Public Web Site.
&#61607;	CaseLink:  A ColdFusion Application that “links” a document file that is not already stored within CTS to an existing Case Event. The CaseLink module loads a document into CTS to an existing case event. 
&#61607;	DMS Search: A Search Engine on the OALJ Public Web Site that facilitates the public’s retrieval of case decision documents. 

SCOPE OF WORK

1.	Technical End User Support – Contractor personnel shall provide direct (one-on-one) end user support to all users of the CTS or as directed by OALJ.

<DESC>CONTAINERIZED BATCH LAUNDRY (CBL) MARKET SURVEY Purpose: The purpose of this survey is to solicit your interest, current capabilities, and potential in   performing the roles of Product Support Integrator/ Product Support Provider in support of a Containerized Batch Laundry (CBL) Performance Based Logistics (PBL ) Program. The government is seeking information to develop a PBL concept for CBL.  The Government has not committed to PBL for CBL at this point.  IAW AR 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is DODs preferred support strategy for materiel systems.  The Army will imp lement PBL, when appropriate, on weapon systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness; increased reliability; enhanced logistics response times; enhanced deployment support; enhanced wartime support; reduction in the logistics  footprint, and reduction in logistics costs.  The term  PSI refers to both government and civilian agencies with which we may establish a contract or an agreement. Under a PBL contract, the contractor would be responsible for a large portion of the CBL logistics support, such as supply chain management and reduction in scheduled and unscheduled Crew, Organizational and Direct/General Support level maintenance through  improvements to the system.  The Army would retain responsibility for all  maintenance of the CBL.  Sustainment training may be the contractors responsibility.  The support process is required to be transparent to the war fighter.  In addition, the contr actor would be responsible for CBL configuration management, to include recommendation and implementation of configuration changes to improve performance and reliability. PBL Definition: See Appendix A for Definitions of PBL and other frequently used terminology. Intent: Length/Type of Contract: Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Price Contract for up to 20 years.   Goal: The ultimate goal is improved system readiness and ultra-reliability.  A goal is to structure a contract which would incentivize the contractor to maximize system reliability, thereby reducing maintenance, spare parts and training requirements in the proce ss.  Desired Results and Outcomes:  1.  Operational readiness 98% or better for the system.   2.  Reduced Logistics Footprint, unscheduled maintenance, training burden, scheduled maintenance and maintenance times. Proposed Measurements:  Level of performance expressed in terms of measurable outcomes/how outcomes are to be measured and evaluated. Current Report Available: 1.  The current DA Form 2406, Unit Equipment and Serviceability Report (U) provides data on the following; Not Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) and Not Mission Capable Maintenance (NMCM) for both the Organizational level maintenance and Support level maintena nce. These are the only metrics recorded, maintained, reported and available to the PM or PSI.   Data is reported in percentages of down time due to the lack of repair parts [Not Mission Capable Supply (NMCS)] or lack of time, or maintenance personnel to p erform the maintenance [Not Mission Capable Maintenance (NMCM)].  The backside of the DA Form 2406 provides data on specific equipment (by bumper number) that is down at the time of the report.  2. DA Form 2406 data can provide an indication that a systemic problem exists. However, it does not provide specific parts or procedures that fail causing low readiness rates.  Commanders can provide comments/remarks in their monthly Unit Status Report (US R).   3.  Reported data is not always accurate, although it can indicate a systemic problem within a fleet. But it does not necessarily provide the root cause of that systemic failure. 4.  As mentioned, the monthly DA Form 2406 is the only metric available to the PM for review and assessment of how well our system is performing.  No other statistics are maintained or reported.  Any other data desired or required would have to be research ed by the contractor.  U nits are not manned, nor do they have the expertise or equipment, to collect any other data.  Additional data, e.g., MTBEFF, MTBSA, etc., would need to be collected by trained personnel outside the unit.   Potential Performance Measures: The following performance measures could be established for the CBL for supply support and can be tracked through the Commodity Command Standard System (CCSS).   1.  The PSI would be responsible for maintaining a Non-Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) rate, e.g., less than 2% at the Organizational and Support (under the two-level maintenance concept; Field and Sustainment level of maintenance).  2.  The PSI would be responsible for the transportation/shipping of material to destination. The PSI would ship all assets to the commercial shipping address specified by the activity. The PSI would be responsible for meeting delivery time frames specified  below. The PSI must be able to provide asset visibility to the requisitionor and would be responsible for providing input to the Global Transportation Network (GTN) for all shipments of material for which the PSI is assigned as the Inventory Control Point  ICP.  Order Ship Time (OST) is the time from when a requisition is dropped to the time it is closed out by the recipient and is inclusive of transportation. Order Ship Time (OST) for Essentiality Code A items: 	Priority 01-03;   2-3 days  Priority 04-08;  4-5 days				 Priority 09-15	 6-8 days  Order Ship Time (OST) for Essentiality Code C items: 	Priority 01-03;   3-4 days 				Priority 04-08;  5-7 days 				Priority 09-15	 8-10 days 3.  Inventory Control. The PSI would be accountable for the storage, management and distribution of the wholesale inventory using the PSIs approved inventory management processes. Warehouse Denials would be 0%.   The PSI would be responsible for the manag ement and accountability of the retail stock at ASL/ PLL level. The required outcome is to have serviceable spares and repair parts available to support planned CBL operational requirements. The PSI would report the status of the wholesale inventory to the  Government 4. Quality of Parts. All articles delivered would be required to be free from defects in accordance with their operational application. Any article failing to operate correctly would be returned to the PSI for repair or replacement. If the PSI is a contrac tor, a monthly report would be required.  If the PSI is government, Quality Deficiency Reports (QDRs) would be monitored. 5. Failure Reporting, Analysis and Corrective Action. The PSI would, as part of an overall reliability program, define and describe the implementation of a failure and fault reporting, analysis and corrective action program. The PSI would tabulate and trac e all reported failures from discovery to action closeout. All failure analysis would be closed out within 60 days of occurrence unless the Government grants an extension. 6.  Supply Support Requirements. The PSI would procure, repair, overhaul, manage, and distribute spare parts and material, both repairable and consumable, to satisfy all CBL wholesale and retail supply support requirements. The PSI would procure and distri bute retail level requirements. This refers specifically to Authorized Stockage List (ASL) and Prescribed Load List (PLL).  The PSI would make recommendations to unit commanders on lines to be stocked at the unit and Direct Support (DS) level. The PSI woul d be responsible for determining wholesale requirements to support demand forecasts. The PSI would provide the necessary services to accommodate anticipated Government requirements (deployments).  7. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). The PSI would receive and process all requisitions and maintain an on- line requisition status tracking and reporting system capable of providing requisition and transportation status, requisition cancellations, and re quisition notifications. The system would have to be capable of providing status on  all Government requisitions to authorized Government offices and individual requisition status to requisitioning units.  8. Configuration Management. The PSI would manage CBL weapon system configuration to ensure integrity and compatibility of the system, subsystem, assembly, and subassembly configuration baseline in an automated configuration database.  9.  The PSI would administer and manage a repair program for Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) while retaining other metrics as outlined above.  10.  Reduced Logistics Footprint  The government would seek a measurable reduction in number of tools required (special and common); measurable reduction in number of maintenance, repair and troubleshooting tasks; measurable reduction of training required ; and a measurable increase in fuel economy. PBL System Candidates: See Appendix B for profile of the CBL. Systems to be supported under this PBL Program are systems currently in production and systems to be fielded.   These profiles would include both wartime and peacetime OPTEMPO and specific details necessary to determine level of work required to perform th e support operations.

We appreciate your cooperation in answering these questions and thank you in advance for your participation.   APPENDIX A DEFINITIONS Performance Based Logistics (PBL):  PBL is a product support strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes), and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall on the PMs designated Product Support Integrator (PSI) and their support provider(s).  PBL is: - Buying results not resources - Using performance specs not design specs - Buying solution or an outcome not def ining the process and methods to achieve a pre-determined course of action. - About assigning responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. Product Support Integrator (PSI):  The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system.  This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a private /public sector partnership).       Product Support Provider (PSP):  The PSP is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to all providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.  The PSI would be required to n egotiate Performance Based Agreements (PBA) type arrangements with all PSPs to fulfill their responsibility.   Examples of PSPs include:  DLA centers, AMC MSC Inventory Materiel Management Centers (IMMCs), Depots, contractors sub-contractors, etc. APPENDIX B CBL PBL CANDIDATE PROFILE  Vehicle System     Containerized Batch Laundry System Description/Mission Profile SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: The CBL consists of two washer-extractors, two dryers, a water heater, an electric water pump, a sewer ejection unit, ventilation, a Field Deployable Environmental Control Unit (FDECU), the Army Space Heater (ASH), a water reuse/recycle system which will a llow water used during the rinse cycles to be reused.  A 16 x 20 TEMPER tent will be provided as a shelter when processing laundry.  The CBL is contained in an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Deployable Medical Systems (DEPMEDS) side -opening shipping container (20x8x8) to facilitate transport by sea, air, or land.  The CBL will be operated by four soldiers (three operators and a team supervisor IAW current Force Structure) during a 10-hour shift.  The CBL will be set up, operated, maintained, and prepared for storage by unit personnel Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) 92S (operators) and MOS 63J (maintainers).  The CBL will be used to clean individual and organizational items of clothing during conventional operations.    The pr imary mission for the CBL will be to launder 150-200 pounds of laundry per hour in support of the CSH.  The CBL will be used as a total replacement for the M85 Laundry Unit (LIN: L48315) in the CSH.  The system may be required to move once every 14 days. In addition to the CSH, the Special Operations Support Battalion (SOSB) will also be fielded the CBL to support 750 to a maximum of 1850 personnel in two different area of operations.  The CBL will be an integrated system with the capability to allow for t he performance of all laundry functions including receipt, sorting, folding, and distribution.   	Predecessor System Information: The CBL replaces the M85 Laundry [Line Item Number (LIN L48315)] in Combat Support Hospitals. Two each will be fielded to these units at 26 different locations with one each going to 4 schools. MISSION SCENARIO The primary mission of CBL will be to launder a minimum of 150 lbs. (200 lbs. maximum) of laundry per hour in support of corps Combat Support Hospitals (CSH).  The CBL will provide laundry support for the 248 patients and 506-soldier unit as well as any li nens and surgical gowns the hospital needs laundered.  The CBL will operate in hot and basic conditions from -25 to +120 degrees Fahrenheit (F) to support laundry operations for the 248-bed hospital requiring the laundering of 4600 pounds of laundry per da y.  The CSH can be split into two separate hospital company entities, which requires them to operate independently of each other (a 164-bed and an 84-bed hospital).  Three thousand pounds of laundry will be laundered at the 164-bed and 1600 pounds at the 8 4-bed.  The CBL will be a total replacement for the M85 Laundry Unit, trailer-mounted and will be capable of cleaning individual and organizational items of clothing during conventional operat ions.  The system may be required to move once every 14 days.  The CBL may be transported by a load handling system designed to transport ISO containers or the PLS.  The CBL crew must be able to secure, upload, or download the system using materiel handlin g equipment, perform pre-combat checks, expand and close the shelter and operate the system while wearing Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) II and arctic clothing.   An additional mission of the CBL will be to support the laundry mission of the Special Operations Support Battalion (SOSB), which also requires the CBL, and will be co-located in two different theaters of operations and will support a minimum of 750 to max imum of 1850 personnel.  	The following are the Operational Mode Summaries/Mission Profiles (OMS/MP): Typical CBL Daily Operating Profile Tasks # of Operators	# of Occur	Time (Hours)	 Total Service Checks (Before PMCS (shift change), fuel, water)	 2 per shift	2	1.0	2.0 Operate on Demand	 Washer and Dryer Operations	 2 per shift	2	10.00	20 Service Checks (After PMCS (shift change), fuel, water)	 2 per shift	2	1.0	2.0 Total Time			12.0	24.0 14 Day Wartime Mission Profile 	Hours per  Day	 No. Days	 Total Hours Movement to Operating Site 12.0	 1	 12.0 Operating Time (OT)	10.0 20.0 	1,14 2-13 	20.0 240.0 	Total OT: 260 Standby Time (PMCS Before and After) 	2.00 4.0	1,14 2-13	4 48 Movement from Operating Site	 12.0	 1	 12.0 Calendar Time	 24.0	 14	 336.0 CLIMATIC AND MOBILITY CONDITIONS Climatic Design Types (AR 70-38)	% of Usage		Mobility Conditions	% of Usage Basic	85		Improved Roads	50 Hot	15		Unimproved Roads	40 			Cross Country	10 OEM  SFA Defense Products 20 South Wisner Street P.O. Box 820 Frederick, MD  21701 Point of Contact Name: Mr. Joseph Digirolamo Telephone Number:  410.820.9140 Email Address: jdigirolamo@sfa.com Fleet Assessment   Fielding will begin in January 2006.   Annual Support Workload (Maint AMMS)  Scheduled Services, etc. The CBL is supported by the standard Army logistics and maintenance systems.  The CBL is repairable within the current four level Army maintenance system.  No additional MOSs are required to support the CBL and no additional personnel are required as a res ult of fielding the CBL.  An overall system manual for the CBL has been published with the exception of the 23P. The 23P will be published by the end 1QFY06.  If repairs cannot be made at the DS level, maintenance personnel would contact an SBC Logistics  Assistance Representatives (LARs) for assistance.  LARS can and do contact the PM Force Sustainment Systems office for further assistance. Unit Level (UL) Maintenance. Unit maintenance includes Preventative Maintenance Checks and Services (PMCS), replacement of easily accessible unserviceable parts not requiring special tools or test materiel, lubrication, cleaning, preserving, tightening, replacement of parts and module s (authorized by the MAC, minor adjustments, and inspection of components.   Direct Support (DS) Maintenance. DS maintenance using common test equipment provides Line Replacement Unit (LRU) services to unit maintenance.   General Support (GS) Maintenance 	The current Maintenance Allocation Chart (MAC) does not identify any GS level tasks. Depot Maintenance 	Depot may perform overhaul if required.  However, given the low density of CBL, this function would most likely be contracted.  The current MAC only identifies oneDepot level repairs. Reliability  Details about the current system readiness requirements are as follows: The CBL shall have a probability of completion of 20 hours of operation as described in the Operational Mode Summary/Mission Profile (OMS/MP) without the occurrence of an essential function failure of at least 0.90 (T) at least 0.95 (O).  The CBL shall hav e a probability of completion of 20 hours of laundry operations as  described in the OMS/MP without the occurrence of a system abort of at least 0.95 (T) greater than 0.95 (O) Depot Capability  Current Workload None.  Annual Sustainment Parts Cost	 $50K (Estimated);  $30K (Estimated) for consumables.

<DESC>Purpose: The purpose of this survey is to solicit your interest, current capabilities, and potential in   performing the roles of Product Support Integrator/ Product Support Provider in support of a Containerized Kitchen (CK) Performance Based Logistics (PBL) Progr am. The government is seeking information to develop a PBL concept for CK.  The Government has not committed to PBL for CK at this point.  IAW AR 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is DODs preferred support strategy for materiel systems.

A goal is to structure a contract, which would incentivize the contractor to maximize system reliability, thereby reducing maintenance, spare parts and training requirements in the proc ess.  Desired Results and Outcomes:  1.  Operational readiness 98% or better for the system.  CK is reported as a system and includes the 10kW Generator and the M1083 5T Cargo Truck.  2.  Reduced Logistics Footprint, unscheduled maintenance, training burden, scheduled maintenance and maintenance times. Proposed Measurements:  Level of performance expressed in terms of measurable outcomes/how outcomes are to be measured and evaluated. Current Report Available: 1.  The current DA Form 2406, Unit Equipment and Serviceability Report (U) provides data on the following; Not Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) and Not Mission Capable Maintenance (NMCM) for both the Organizational level maintenance and Support level maintena nce. These are the only metrics recorded, maintained, reported and available to the PM or PSI.   Data is reported in percentages of down time due to the lack of repair parts [Not Mission Capable Supply (NMCS)] or lack of time, or maintenance personnel to p erform the maintenance [Not Mission Capable Maintenance (NMCM)].

APPENDIX A DEFINITIONS Performance Based Logistics (PBL):  PBL is a product support strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes)., and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall on the PMs designated  Product Support Integrator (PSI) and their support provider(s).  PBL is: - Buying results not resources - Using performance specs not design specs - Buying so lution or an outcome not defining the process and methods to achieve a pre-determined course of action. - About assigning responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. Product Support Integrator (PSI):  The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system.  This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a private /public sector partnership).       Product Support Provider (PSP):  The PSP is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to all providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.  The PSI would be required to n egotiate Performance Based Agreements (PBA) type arrangements with all PSPs to fulfill their responsibility.   Examples of PSPs include:  DLA centers, AMC MSC Inventory Materiel Management Centers (IMMCs), Depots, contractors, sub-contractors, etc. New Equipment Training (NET):  NET is training operators and maintainers receiving the system during initial fielding on how to operate and maintain the equipment.  Sustainment Training: Sustainment training is follow-up instruction after using the equipment for some time concentrating on changes and upgrades to the system. Two Level Maintenance: The two levels of maintenance are field level (on-system) and sustainment level (off system) replacing the previous four levels (unit, direct support (DS), general support (GS) and depot. Field Maintenance: Considered on-system maintenance. Combines the maintenance activities previously completed at the unit and DS levels. Sustainment Maintenance: Considered off-system maintenance. Combines the maintenance activities previously completed at the GS and depot levels. Reliability: The probability that an item will perform its intended function for a specified interval under stated conditions. Recapitalization (recap): Complete repair and overhaul of worn out equipment to like-new condition.

A MEP803A 10 kW Tactical Quiet Generator (TQG) 120/208 volts, 50/60Hz, 60 amp, 3 phased system, provides system po wer.  Six (6) Modern Burner Units (MBU) are integrated into the systems cooking equipment: one field oven, a griddle top, a steam table and a tray pack heater.  Refrigerated and heated storage, environmental control and running water are provided on board .  Major appliances include two refrigerators, two air conditioners, a heated cabinet and a sink. All of these items are sheltered within a hybrid expandable 8 x 8 x 20 ISO container and placed on a tactical trailer towable by the 5 Ton Family of Medium  Tactical Vehicles (FMTVs). The CK was developed to meet the requirement for the capability to feed soldiers in the field IAW the Army standard of two prepared meals and an operational ration each day.  The CK has the capability to provide up to three hot UGR or A ration meals per day for units responsible for feeding up to 800 troops in all field scenarios and in most climate conditions. The CK pumps and heats water for cooking and washing. The CK requires 45 minutes or less to set up or take down by assig ned crew of four (4) personnel consisting of 5th percentile (female) to 95th percentile (male) and a supervisor. The CK in its deployed configuration provides over 390 square feet of enclosed floor space, 280 sq. ft. of which is allotted for the food prepa ration area.  Preventive Maintenance Checks and Services (PMCS) can be accomplished in 30 minutes or less. Major and/or Secondary Items:  The CK consists of six (6) Modern Burner Units (MBU) that are integrated into the systems cooking equipment: one field oven, a griddle top, a steam table and a tray pack heater.  Refrigerated and heated storage, environmental control and running water are provided on board.  Major appliances include two refrigerators, two air conditions, a heated cabinet and a sink. In one ISO frame measuring 8x8x20.  An awning that covers the mechanical room platform to provide protection from rain, sun, and wind. Basic Sustainment Materiel (BSM):  There are two requirements that must be supplied before the unit can be operated.  These are water for the on-board sink and fuel (JP8) for the MBUs and the generator.  The CK operates on either commercially provided powe r (208 volt, 50-60 Hertz, 3 phase) or Army tactical generator power 10 kilowatts (kW). Predecessor System Information: The CK replaces the Mobile Kitchen Trailer [Line Item Number (LIN L28351)] on a one for two basis.  MISSION SCENARIO Deployed within the brigade, division, corps, and echelons above corps area, the CK operation would feed up to three hot meals a day to up to 800 Soldiers per meal.  Support to forward area (brigade and battalion trains), and decentralized operations may r equire the CK to move once during a 72 hour period.   The peacetime mission supports dictated civil relief operations and military feeding training exercises, during which time operations would follow the applicable wartime OMS/MP. 	The CK will be deployed Army wide to provide greatly improved field feeding operations.  The CK will be used during all phases of peacetime training and under wartime conditions, supporting all types of missions and conflicts. The CK will be provided for use in Combat, Combat Support (CS) and Combat Service Support (CSS) units.  It will be transportable by all sea, rail, ground, and air transportation assets. The CK will operate in Hot and Basic Climatic Design Types.  The operational temperature range for  the CK is from -25 degrees F to +120 degrees F.

<SUBJECT>41--MARKET SURVEY FOR 8X8X20 REFRIGERATED CONTAINER SYSTEM (RCS)
<SOLNBR>PMFSS-RCS
<RESPDATE>101505
<ARCHDATE>12142005
<CONTACT>joyce.croci, 508-233-4360
<DESC>Purpose: The purpose of this survey is to solicit your interest, current capabilities, and potential in   performing the roles of Product Support Integrator/ Product Support Provider in support of a 8X8X20 Refrigerated Container System (RCS) Performance Based Logis tics (PBL) Program. The government is seeking information to develop a PBL concept for RCS.  The Government has not committed to PBL for RCS at this point.  IAW AR 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is DODs preferred support strategy for materiel systems.  The Army  will implement PBL, when appropriate, on weapon systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational readiness; increased reliability; enhanced logistics response times; enhanced deployment support; enhanced wartime support; reduction in the logistics footprint, and reduction in logistics costs.  The term PSI refers to both government and civilian agencies with which we may establish a contract or an agreement. Under a PBL contract, the contractor would be responsible for a large portion of the RCS logistics support, such as supply chain management and reduction in scheduled and unscheduled Crew, Organizational and Direct/General Support level maintenance through  improvements to the system.  The Army would retain responsibility for all maintenance of the RCS.  Sustainment training may be the contractors responsibility.  The support process is required to be transparent to the war fighter.  In addition, the contra ctor would be responsible for RCS configuration management, to include recommendation and implementation of configuration changes to improve performance and reliability. PBL Definition: See Appendix A for Definitions of PBL and other frequently used terminology. Intent: Length/Type of Contract: Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Price Contract for up to 20 years.   Goal: The ultimate goal is improved system readiness and ultra-reliability.  A goal is to structure a contract which would incentivize the contractor to maximize system reliability, thereby reducing maintenance, spare parts and training requirements in the proce ss.  Desired Results and Outcomes:  1.  Operational readiness 98% or better for the system.  RCS is reported as a system and includes the 10kW Generator.  2.  Reduced Logistics Footprint, unscheduled maintenance, training burden, scheduled maintenance and maintenance times. Proposed Measurements:  Level of performance expressed in terms of measurable outcomes/how outcomes are to be measured and evaluated. Current Report Available: 1.  The current DA Form 2406, Unit Equipment and Serviceability Report (U) provides data on the following; Not Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) and Not Mission Capable Maintenance (NMCM) for both the Organizational level maintenance and Support level maintena nce. These are the only metrics recorded, maintained, reported and available to the PM or PSI.   Data is reported in percentages of down time due to the lack of repair parts [Not Mission Capable Supply (NMCS)] or lack of time, or maintenance personnel to p erform the maintenance [Not Mission Capable Maintenance (NMCM)].  The backside of the DA Form 2406 provides data on specific equipment (by bumper number) that is down at the time of the report.  2. DA Form 2406 data can provide an indication that a systemic problem exists. However, it does not provide specific parts or procedures that fail causing low readiness rates.  Commanders can provide comments/remarks in their monthly Unit Status Report (US R).   3.  Reported data is not always accurate, although it can indicate a systemic problem within a fleet. But it does not necessarily provide the root cause of that systemic failure. 4.  As mentioned, the monthly DA Form 2406 is the only metric available to the PM for review and assessment of how well our system is performing.  No other statistics are maintained or reported.  Any other data desired or required would have to be research ed by t he contractor.  Units are not manned, nor do they have the expertise or equipment, to collect any other data.  Additional data, e.g., MTBEFF, MTBSA, etc., would need to be collected by trained personnel outside the unit.   Potential Performance Measures: The following performance measures could be established for the RCS for supply support and can be tracked through the Commodity Command Standard System (CCSS).   1.  The PSI would be responsible for maintaining a Non-Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) rate, e.g., less than 2% at the Organizational and Support (under the two-level maintenance concept; Field and Sustainment level of maintenance).  2.  The PSI would be responsible for the transportation/shipping of material to destination. The PSI would ship all assets to the commercial shipping address specified by the activity. The PSI would be responsible for meeting delivery time frames specified  below. The PSI must be able to provide asset visibility to the requisitionor and would be responsible for providing input to the Global Transportation Network (GTN) for all shipments of material for which the PSI is assigned as the Inventory Control Point  (ICP).  Order Ship Time (OST) is the time from when a requisition is dropped to the time it is closed out by the recipient and is inclusive of transportation. OST for Essentiality Code A items: Priority 01-03;   2-3 days  Priority 04-08;   4-5 days				  Priority 09-15;	  6-8 days  OST for Essentiality Code C items: Priority 01-03;   3-4 days Priority 04-08;   5-7 days Priority 09-15;	 8-10 days 3.  Inventory Control. The PSI would be accountable for the storage, management and distribution of the wholesale inventory using the PSIs approved inventory management processes. Warehouse Denials would be 0%.   The PSI would be responsible for the manag ement and accountability of the retail stock at Authorized Stockage List (ASL) /Prescribed Load List (PLL) level. The required outcome is to have serviceable spares and repair parts available to support planned RCS operational requirements. The PSI would r eport the status of the wholesale inventory to the Government 4. Quality of Parts. All articles delivered would be required to be free from defects in accordance with their operational application. Any article failing to operate correctly would be returned to the PSI for repair or replacement. If the PSI is a contrac tor, a monthly report would be required.  If the PSI is government, Quality Deficiency Reports (QDRs) would be monitored. 5. Failure Reporting, Analysis and Corrective Action. The PSI would, as part of an overall reliability program, define and describe the implementation of a failure and fault reporting, analysis and corrective action program. The PSI would tabulate and trac e all reported failures from discovery to action closeout. All failure analysis would be closed out within 60 days of occurrence unless the Government grants an extension. 6.  Supply Support Requirements. The PSI would procure, repair, overhaul, manage, and distribute spare parts and material, both repairable and consumable; to satisfy all RCS wholesale and retail supply support requirements. The PSI would procure and distri bute retail level requirements. This refers specifically to ASL and PLL.  The PSI would make recommendations to unit commanders on lines to be stocked at the unit and Direct Support (DS) level. The PSI would be responsible for determining wholesale require ments to support demand forecasts. The PSI would provide the necessary services to accommodate anticipated Government requirements (deployments).  7. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). The PSI would receive and process all requisitions and maintain an on-line requisition status tracking and reporting system capable of providing requisition and transportation status, requisition cancellations, and req uisition notifications. The system would have to be capable of providing status on all Government requi sitions to authorized Government offices and individual requisition status to requisitioning units.  8. Configuration Management. The PSI would manage RCS weapon system configuration to ensure integrity and compatibility of the system, subsystem, assembly, and subassembly configuration baseline in an automated configuration database.  9.  The PSI would administer and manage a repair program for Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) while retaining other metrics as outlined above.  10.  Reduced Logistics Footprint  The government would seek a measurable reduction in number of tools required (special and common); measurable reduction in number of maintenance, repair and troubleshooting tasks; measurable reduction of training required ; and a  measurable increase in fuel economy. PBL System Candidates: See Appendix B for profile of the RCS. Systems to be supported under this PBL Program are systems currently in production, systems currently in the Army fleet, and reset/recap systems.   These profiles would include both wartime and peacetime OPTEMPO and specific details necessary to determine level of work required to perform the support operations.

<DESC>The Division of AIDS (DAIDS), of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), helps to ensure an end to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by increasing basic knowledge of the pathogenesis and transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, supporting the development of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, and supporting the development of vaccines and other prevention strategies.  The purpose of this planned acquisition is to seek a contractor to continue an ongoing quality assessment program for virologic assays performed on samples from subjects enrolled in DAIDS-sponsored multi-site clinical studies.  The Virology Quality Assurance (VQA) Program is critical to the scientific integrity of on-going and future studies concerning HIV diagnosis, disease progression, assessment of treatment, vaccine efficacy and other preventive measures.  The VQA has been in operation since 1988 and has developed and standardized quality control procedures for approximately 25 virologic assays used in DAIDS-sponsored clinical trials.  DAIDS is seeking capability statements from organizations capable of performing the following tasks:  (1) implement standards of performance for existing and newly developed virologic assays and assess the ability of Sites to successfully perform the assays; (2) conduct studies on the adaptation, standardization and application of new and existing virologic and biostatistic methodologies; (3) acquire, characterize, store, document and disburse quality control materials and reagents to include biohazardous materials and infectious agents; (4) disseminate Virology Quality Assessment technical and scientific data; (5) maintain computerized software systems that support the VQA Program; and (6) expand services to include additional Sites when necessary through exercise of Options.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITIES RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS AN 8(a) SET-ASIDE; 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE OR AS FULL AND OPEN. ALL SIZE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES. To ensure the validity and inter- and intra-laboratory comparability of virologic laboratory data obtained from DAIDS-supported clinical trials and HIV natural history studies, the contractor will continue a program for "Real-Time Assay Validation," where known quality control materials (QCMs) are tested by VQA-supported laboratories (Sites) in parallel with patient samples to ensure the validity of each assay “run.”  The contractor will also conduct a "Proficiency Testing" (PT) program, where unknown QCMs are tested by the Sites to periodically monitor Site assay performance.  The contractor will provide participating Sites with standardized reagents and controls for conducting research aimed at development and evaluation of virologic and statistical methodologies.  The VQA Program will serve current and future DAIDS-sponsored clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups (User Groups).  Currently supported User Groups include: the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG), the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG), the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS), the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), the Community Program for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA), the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), the Comprehensive International Program of Research on AIDS (CIPRA), the Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP), as well as other domestic and international individual grantees.  Collaborations are anticipated with CDC Global AIDS Program (GAP)-affiliated laboratories supporting the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) activities.  Currently, the VQA program serves approximately 55 domestic and 25 international Sites.  The base contract is expected to cover these 80 Sites.  Although the structure of the clinical trial networks is subject to change during the contract period, the changes are not expected to result in changes to the number of participating Sites in the base contract.  However, the Government anticipates a need to expand the number of Sites during the course of the contract, and such an increase in the contractor’s activities may be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as one or more Options in each of the contract years.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business or 8(a) firms capable of providing laundry processing for Government owned linen and other items as further described below.  This is a request for interested firms with the capability of providing the required services to submit a capability statement along with projected pricing, to assist the Government in determining in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) whether or not this procurement will be set-aside for any of the programs described above. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code 812332 with a size standard code of $12 million dollars.  All respondents are requested to identify their firm’s size and type of business (e.g. small business, service-disabled, HUBZone, 8(a), etc). 

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is one of five agencies of the Public Health Service, which in turn, is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The NIH consists of more than 50 buildings on a 300 acre campus in Bethesda, Maryland. NIH employs approximately 22,000 people making it one of the largest employers in Montgomery County, Maryland.  NIH also operates an animal center in Poolesville, MD, offices in the National Naval Hospital, and occupies several rental buildings in Bethesda, Baltimore, Gaithersburg, and Rockville. The Laundry supports all patient care, animal care, laboratory and service functions at NIH conducted in the on-campus and off campus locations described above as well as in the Children’s Inn, Edmund J. Safra Family Lodge and the Clinical Center/Clinical Research Center (CRC) (located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland), and is under the auspices of the Housekeeping & Fabric Care Department (HFCD) of the Clinical Center.   The estimated total annual pounds of all types of laundry (including but not limited to bulk linen, surgical scrubs, animal bedding, uniforms, animal cage covers, etc) processed is approximately 1.5 million pounds, however, on a daily basis, there may be significant variations in quantities of laundry requiring pickup, delivery and processing from areas at NIH, both on and off the Bethesda, Maryland campus (other than the Clinical Center Hospital complex-CRC/Bldg. 10/Family Lodge and Children’s Inn). From Monday through Friday, the Clinical Center’s laundry accounts for approximately 80% of the daily laundry volume of NIH. On the weekends, the only area at NIH requiring laundry pickup and delivery is at the Clinical Center Hospital complex. . Not all of the locations will require pickup and deliveries on a daily basis, however, the vendor is still required to have the capability to provide the necessary services on a 5 day per week basis (Monday through Friday) to ALL NIH locations.  The vendor shall wash and process in full compliance with all relevant Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) rules and regulations as well as all applicable federal, state and local government regulations regarding control of infectious diseases in health care facilities, the government owned linen and return it to the government free of soil, stains and pathogenic or other contaminant agents. Bulk linen accounts for the major portion of the laundry to be processed.   

The vendor is required to provide all necessary equipment and supplies to perform the required services, including but not limited to truck(s) needed to pickup and deliver all laundry, laundry carts used to pickup and transport linen to and from NIH, etc.  

Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide (a) a capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills and capability to fulfill the Government’s requirements for laundry processing services, including available resources-both with personnel and equipment such as washers, dryers, , trucks, laundry carts, etc.  that would be utilized to process the NIH laundry.  If equipment or supplies are not currently available, the capability statement should  discuss how the contractor would obtain the required equipment needed in order to successfully perform the services.  Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the area of providing the services described. The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail so that the Government can determine the experience, and capability of your firm to provide the required services at fair market prices. Experience should identify on-going and /or previous contracts for the same or similar type of laundry services performed including a brief description, duration, dollar value, client’s name address, telephone number, and name of contact; (b) available resources; and (c) firm’s size and type of business (e.g. small business, service-disabled, HUBZone, 8(a)), etc).

A copy of the capability statement and projected pricing for the laundering and processing of hospital bulk linen, animal bulk linen and lab coats, must be received at the address identified in this synopsis by no later than close of business (4:00 p.m. local time at designated location) on September 30, 2005. Responses by e-mail or facsimile (fax) WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.

The government requests a firm-fixed price, for each line item (tasks, training, travel, etc.) for a one year period.   The requirement is to modify and distribute Spectral Library Identification Classification Explorer (SLICE) software that displays and searches a comprehensive library of x-ray spectra, images, and associated data. The government will have unlimited rights for shared distribution and future expansion of the database, to include additional analytical data such as infrared and mass spectra.  The database will include spectra obtained by SEM-EDS in a form that makes intercomparison of spectra viable. The following tasks shall be accomplished interactively.  Task 1: Assessment of requirements of forensic community. The government will organize a meeting to be attended by government personnel to include IT and security personnel, contractors and selected members of the forensic community.  This meeting is to assess the requirements of the forensic community and analyze issues regarding database modifications.  Prior to this meeting, the contractor shall review the evolution of this project and the recommendation of the Scientific Working Group for Forensic Archive of X-ray spectra (SWGFAX).  The contractor shall review and recommend possible resources to include x-ray spectroscopy, database technology, and information technology.  The results of this meeting shall define the specific modifications to include selection of materials categories required for the Forensic Materials Database, decisions concerning the type of data to be included for each material, requirements of the search and display algorithms, and provisions for access to and sharing of data.  The modified database shall consist of reference spectra and additional descriptive information of manufactured materials, pure elements, compounds, and materials of specific forensic and counter-terrorism interest such as explosives and military ordnance.  The recent formulation of a tape database by scientists from three laboratories utilizing SLICE shall serve as the approach to be utilized in selection of samples and organization of data field for additional material groups.  Similar extensions of SLICE shall be utilizing data provided by the government and other sources of authenticated samples and spectral data of acceptable quality (see Task 2), such as the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), manufacturers, and selected crime laboratories.  The requirement may include additional SLICE material groups such as: gunshot residues and related materials; commercially-available white powders; black electrical tapes; metal alloys, including solders; explosives and pyrotechnics; materials of particular counterterrorism interest, such as military armaments.  The government requires that the Forensic Materials Database shall be modified to fulfill the requirements of the wider forensic community , the database architecture shall possess additional features, such as allowing the addition of data by individual users for purposes of performing small-scale research studies, e.g., to determine case-specific frequencies or product variability.  Task 2: Expand and improve upon existing utility and database structure.  Modifications of the SLICE utility to include the additional features shall be accomplished by building on the government’s current architecture.  The government requires that the modified database utility shall be utilized for a variety of functions, such as the following: Comparison of questioned forensic materials to commercial standards for the purpose of identification; System performance checks based upon comparison of live spectrometer performance to certified spectra;  Determination of frequency of occurrence of compositional types; Determination of variations of composition within a type of material; Associations of a material with a specific manufacturer; Identification of compounds.  The following specific tasks may be required: (a) Develop QA criteria for inclusion of submitted spectra.  The contractor shall perform experiments to determine the ranges of SEM/EDS operational parameters (e.g., tube voltage and current, detector dead time, x-ray take-off angle, etc.) that result in spectra of acceptable quality.  The effects of changes in these parameters shall be evaluated by measuring the correctness of the matching algorithms used for spectral comparison.  The results shall be utilized to set acceptable limits for inclusion of spectra in the database; (b) Include XRD, FTIR, Raman, chromatography, and MS data (spectra and discrete data) within materials records, with query and display utilities that shall be used in conjunction with present SEM/EDS data searches.  Expansion and enhanced capabilities of SLICE shall include spectra and analytical data obtained by additional instrumental methods; (c) Supplemental data display in spreadsheet format.  Modification of the utility is required to output data in a format readily compatible with a standard spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel; (d) Modify the comprehensive image management.  The current image management routines needs modification to bring them up to current imaging standards; (e) Incorporate PDF file display capability in the image section; (f) Modify for construction of an SEM/EDS spectrum from a given composition.  In cases where suitable reference information does not exist, calculation of a spectrum for a given composition is required for evaluation of evidentiary materials.  Contractor shall perform test with reference materials to demonstrate the accuracy limitations of the spectral construction algorithm; (g) Modify for the ability to subtract component spectra from a combined spectrum and the ability to create a bulk spectrum from a combination of component spectra; (h) Define a comprehensive materials Atree@.  The current directory structure based on materials classes requires modification to make it compatible with future expansion and multi-user sharing of the database; (i) Make modification to the fitting algorithms used for comparison of x-ray induced XRF spectra.  Although XRF spectra share features with EDS spectra, they have specific search algorithm requirements for which the current version of SLICE needs modification; (j) Evaluate the usefulness of combining the SLICE "identification" utilities with automatic particle recognition protocols, in order to characterize particle populations in an unattended search; (k) Evaluate the usefulness of providing direct links from SLICE materials records to Internet materials directories and resources, for installation in facilities where Internet access does not violate security requirements; (l) Recommend a mechanism for protection and distribution of compartmentalized materials data for distribution only to specifically selected users. Task 3: Distribution of utility and training.  The contractor shall provide ten copies of the modified software to the government.  These copies shall be loaded onto the controlling computers for SEM instruments and stand-alone PCs at the government and other locations.  The software shall operate such that the x-ray spectra acquired from samples of questioned origin can be searched against selected portions of the entire database.  The software shall be modified such that data entered by any user can be utilized in search routines by other users.  Sharing of unclassified data for this implementation shall be by transfer on storage media, such as CDs, or by transferring of files via the Internet.  Maintenance of a master Forensic Materials Database containing files input from the multiple users shall be accomplished by the contractor during the course of the contract, i.e., during product modification.  The contractor shall provide a scheme for continued data entry and sharing among users of the database following completion of the contract and delivery of the modified software. Upon the government’s acceptance this data shall become the basis of the Forensic Materials Database and the modified software shall be made available by the contractor for use by a wider population.  The contractor shall provide on-site training for the modifications of the software for the government and other designated individuals at Quantico, Virginia. Deliverables: 1) Report containing the consensus requirements established by the contractor and the advisory group; 2) List of technical obstacles, including any modifications or enhancements required, and recommended approach to solve them; 3) Periodic update version releases of the software as they are modified during the course of this contract; 4) Ten copies of a fully functional database for installation at user locations for evaluation, data entry, and utilization for evidence evaluation.  A mechanism for sharing of data among user workstations shall be provided; 5) Comprehensive operational manual including criteria for spectral acquisition and database use; 6) A final report summarizing all work on this project and results obtained shall be due one month following the end of the contract period.  The report shall be submitted in both paper (5 copies) and one electronic format to the CO (one paper copy) and the COTR (4 paper copies); 7) All original notes and data related to spectral interpretation or statistical evaluation in either paper or electronic format, as appropriate, to archive for discovery purposes shall be submitted to the COTR; 8) Upgrades to the software following completion of this project to the government in perpetuity; 9) Source code for all software.  Government Furnished Property - All data, including X-ray spectra, required for database development and evaluation will be provided by the government and other participants.  The contractor may utilize the government data to demonstrate the characteristics of the SLICE software, but may not charge a distribution fee for the Forensic Materials Database. Qualifications of Key Personnel.  The Contractor shall identify all key personnel assigned to this contract.  All key personnel shall sign non-disclosure agreements and obtain required security clearances prior to commencing work on this contract.  Specialized Reporting Requirements - 1) Electronic versions of monthly progress reports shall be submitted by the 5th working day (for the previous month) of each month to the COTR.  Electronic versions of reports shall be accessible with Microsoft Office 97 software (Word, Excel, Power Point) or with Corel WordPerfect 8.  If a report is too large for e-mail submission, it may be submitted on CD-ROM; 2) Quarterly reports shall be submitted at the end of March, June, September, and December. Quarterly Reports shall contain the following sections:  Critical Project Milestones (status; if completed, date of completion); Quarterly Roadblocks (if any, and steps taken to resolve); Next Month's Plans; Deliverables Met (that quarter); Quarterly Status Update.  The Quarterly Status Update is the lengthiest portion of the report and shall describe technical accomplishments and appropriate budgetary information.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6 of the FAR, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement shall serve two purposes, one, to alert contractors that RFQ V218535223CT99 issued on 23 AUG 2005 is hereby cancelled and two, hereby announces the request for quote for the required items under a new RFQ V218535255CT99; a subsequent solicitation document will not be issued.  Fleet Industrial Supply Center Norfolk intends to purchase for the USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) the following items;
0001 Re-Seal Cosmetic Polymeric (Monolithic Seamless) Deck Covering:  Furnish labor and material to sand and reseal with two coats clear epoxy sealant.  The area of decking measures approximately 19,000 SF (clean RFQ and list of spaces spreadsheet can be obtained by emailing the Contracting Officer scott.wilkins@navy.mil ).  Deck covering is to be in accordance with MIL SPEC MIL-D-24613.  Final product shall be a smooth, non-porous, continuous, bright (glassy), hard deck covering.  Haziness, cloudy finish, misty appearances, air bubbles, or debris shall be cause for rejection.  Contractor shall maintain completion log in order to track contract ‘ceiling’ of specified square footage.
Ship requests delivery completion no-later-than (NLT) 31 DEC 2005.  FOB Point Destination Naval Base Norfolk, Norfolk, VA 23511 and Norfolk Naval Ship Yard, Norfolk VA 23502.  Contractor shall adhere to all requirements and regulations of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the USS Harry S. Truman and the Norfolk Naval Shipyard once established. 
The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JAN 2004), 52.212-2  EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.   Contract evaluation and process will conducted under FAR Part 13.5 – Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Past Performance and Price, with past performance being somewhat more important than price. (1)  Past Performance Evaluation Standards: The offeror shall demonstrate Past Performance through completion of similar U.S. Navy contracts for same or similar installations.  The Contracting Officer may consider past performance experience with contracts that cover numerous other types of marine decking installation contracts.  Data submitted by the offeror other than relevant contracts may not be considered.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Failure to submit past performance information shall be considered certification (by signature on the proposal) that the contractor has no past performance for like or similar items for the Government to evaluate.  Offerors are required to provide information on no more than five (5) of the firm’s most recently completed U.S. Navy (not to exceed five years since completion) for like or similar services to those to be provided under this RFQ.  Offerors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts/orders should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation.  
Offerors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the proposal with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the proposals of other offerors having acceptable or better past performance.
Offerors are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry.  This information may include Contracting Officer’s knowledge and experience with contracts he or she has written, Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS), or past performance information from any source.  The information contained in offeror's Past Performance submittals will be evaluated by the PCO with the assistance of a Contract Specialist, if assigned.  The PCO will evaluate the offeror's Past Performance using the following sub-factors, which are of equal importance.
(a) Quality:  The offeror’s demonstrated history of delivering products and services of high quality and compliance with contractual requirements.  Quality will be evaluated in terms of: overall customer satisfaction, instances of rework and/or deficiency reports, and evidence of effective and/or innovative work applications that were beneficial to the customer.
(b)Timeliness: The offeror’s compliance with delivery and/or performance schedules, timeliness of submission of requested information, reports, and invoicing. 
(c) Contractor Responsiveness:  The offeror’s demonstrated ability to respond to customer concerns, isolate and resolve problems, and take systemic improvement action.
Each performance risk assessment of the factors listed above will consider:  the number, type, and severity of problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken and the overall work record.  
The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror’s performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information, therefore the adjectival ratings generally correlate with the definitions of performance risk as follows: 
Very Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will very successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets and exceeds contractual requirements to the Federal Government’s benefit.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.  This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA).
Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appears or were satisfactory. This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA).
Moderate Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions or the contractor’s proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. This equates to Acceptable (A).
High Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor’s corrective actions appear or were ineffective. This equates to Marginal (M).
Neutral:  No relevant past performance history, or for which past performance information is not provided or available.  Unknown performance risk assessment.  This equates to Neutral (N).
Under most circumstances, it will be unnecessary to divulge the solicitation number, or other identifying information to the reference.  In the event that it is necessary, you need to obtain a non-disclosure statement from the party to whom the information was provided.
The assessment of the offeror’s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offerors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFP.  In determining the rating of past performance evaluation factor, the Government will give greater consideration to the contracts which the Government determines are most relevant to the RFP. 
2.  Price:  The PCO will evaluate Price.  When the proposals are received, the PCO shall review the submission of offers as specified in FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors– Commercial Items (Jan 2004), paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(11).
The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose total offer is the most advantageous to the Government.  Offers must include prices for the CLIN listed.  Failure to do this may be cause for rejection of the offer for the CLIN listed.
The offeror’s proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.404-1.  The evaluation may include, but is not limited to: 
a)	Price comparison with other offerors; 
b)	Completeness:  All pricing information as it directly relates to the SOW; and
c)	Comparison with independent Government estimates.
Although price is the least most important evaluation factor, it has the potential to become more significant during the evaluation process.  The degree of importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factor on which selection is to be based.  The importance of price will also increase when a proposal's price is so significantly high as to diminish the value to the Government that might be gained under the other aspects of the offer.  If, at any stage of the evaluation, all offeror’s are determined to have submitted equal, or virtually equal, or generally equivalent, non-price proposals, price could become the factor in determining which offeror shall received the award.
3.  Best Value Determination.  The Government reserves the right to select an offeror with other than the best past performance, if the price is so advantageous to the Government as to constitute best value.  On the other hand, the Government may select an offeror with other than the lowest price if the quality of past performance and a fair and reasonable price of a competitor result in the greatest value to the Government.  Any such determination of best value will be made by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the evaluation criteria identified in this plan and the solicitation.
 (b) Options. N/A.
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   Please respond by providing a proposal response for the Statement of Work to micaela.bowers1@us.army.mil by 3:00 p.m. EST for the following: STATEMENT OF WORK 1.	Task Order Title. The Effect of Computer-Based Problem Knowledge Couplers on the Development of Diagnostic Skills of Medical Students 2.	Objective. The Department of Health Affairs is looking for ways to provide consistent health care to soldiers and other Department of Defense (DoD) beneficiaries. Use of automation tools, such as the problem knowledge coupler, extends a health care prov iders basic fund of knowledge and enables a more comprehensive differential diagnosis.  Unlike other computer-based diagnostic tools that analyze only the information that is entered into the machine to make a diagnosis, the Problem Knowledge Coupler (PKC ) actually suggests information through cross referencing and categorizes the information in order of statistical signifigance. There is no comparable medical history taking or medical recording keeping tool to date.  Utilization of the problem knowledge c oupler as a teaching tool may be the answer to the lack of time to teach critical areas in depth. It lends itself well to current educational tools such as problems-based learning. Currently, (PKC) is being used as a tool to collect comprehensive historical patient information in order to assist diagnosis and management in primary clinical medical situations. Pilot projects are now in place in medical clinics at Fort Knox, KY and May port Navy Base, FL. If this tool will become part of the system in which the military/federal trainee or student will work, then it should be also an instrument of their education.  In fact, it may become an alternative to the limited didactic teaching of an already crammed clinical rotation.  The objective of this proposal is to validate the PKC as a teaching tool as well as a data collections system. 3.	Scope.  The contractor will :  a.  procure hardware, software, and expendibles necessary to complete the project; b.  facilitate trainee/student evaluation; c.  collate and statistically analyze data. 4.

Offe rors lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

The offeror should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmati vely state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the offeror's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully me et the requirements of the RFP. The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFP.

Amendment 3.

The purpose of this amendment is to answer Questions and Answers asked by contractor(s).

1.  I VIEWED THE AMENDMENT TO THE RFQ REFERENCED ABOVE. JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS......SIDE TRACKS ARE NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!!!! THE SHADES DO NOT STAY IN THE TRACKS. IT WILL BE A MAINTENANCE NIGHTMARE TO DO ANY TYPE OF REPAIR ON THESE SHADES LET ALONE GETTING SHADES BACK INTO THE TRACKS EVERY TIME THEY COME OUT. THEY ARE NOT NECESSARY FOR THE FUNCTION OF THE SHADE.  Answer:  Given the size of the shades we choose to require tracks and believe that the tracks will assist in keeping the shades in better shape over the years. Our specifications remain unchanged. 
2.  YOU ARE ASKING FOR 2 WALL MOUNTED SWITCHES BUT IN YOUR DESCRIPTION YOU ASK FOR A SWITCH TO CONTROL THE UPPER MOTORS AS ONE AND THE LOWER MOTORS AS ONE AND THEN INDIVIDUALLY CONTROL EACH MOTOR ON THE UPPER LEVEL (WHICH WOULD REQUIRE 5 ADDITIONAL SWITCHES) AND INDIVIDUALLY CONTROL EACH MOTOR ON THE LOWER LEVEL (WHICH WOULD REQUIRE 5 MORE SWITCHES) FOR A TOTAL OF 12 SWITCHES. Answer:  The following clarification is provided; we need two (2) wall mounted “gang boxes”, each with six (6) button stations. The six (6) buttons would serve to control the upper shades collectively (one button) and the other five (5) buttons to control the shades individually. The same set up would apply to the bottom shades.  

Submission date and time of quotations remains unchanged.

ANSWER:  Specifications require a film that is clear and has a shading coefficient of 0.68.  
 
3.  Question:  The specs note, “ensure that all tinted windows have no air bubbles after installation.”   Does this mean that the film is tinted or that the windows are tinted?
ANSWER:  The windows are tinted.
 
4.  Question:  Please clarify conflicting statements in the specifications:  “clear window film” vs. “shading coefficient of 68%”.  These statements conflict with each other as one calls for a “clear film” and the other a “shaded film”.  Please clarify which product is required.

ANSWER:  The specifications do not require certifications.
 
16.  Question: Manufactures do not issue warrantees to Company's  that are not certified to install blast mitigation films. We need to be advised of what GSA standard you are trying to achieve.

17.  Question:  What product did you write your spec from?
ANSWER:  See the answer to #1 above. 
 
18.  Question:  Our experience from other military projects dictates that there should be requirements for Company's involved as well as installers?
ANSWER:  Other military projects are irrelevant to this requirement.  
 
19.  Question:  Can you still get the level of protection you want with a seam in the middle of the  glass?
ANSWER:  The adhesive used to install the film should maintain the level of protection to almost the same level.

HSAR 3009.104-75  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), 
except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 
(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. (End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
	
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may 
file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of 
the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity, does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002.

business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for 
this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). 
However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer 
in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself 
manufacture, is 500 employees. 
(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office 
specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this 
solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or 
as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show -- 
(1) The solicitation number; 
(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;

(7) “Remit to” address, if different than mailing address;

(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to 
include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other 
references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone 
numbers and other relevant information); and 
(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement 
specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions 
included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required 
representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the 
solicitation may be excluded from consideration. 
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in 
its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of 
offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the 
solicitation. 
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall 
be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless 
otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at 
no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender’s request and expense, 
unless they are destroyed during preaward testing. 
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers 
presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying 
the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated 
separately. 
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, 
revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in 
the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is 
specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, 
for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are 
due. 
(2) 
(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at 
the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time 
specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it 
is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that 
accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and— 
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by 
the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the 
Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the 
date specified for receipt of offers; or 
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the 
Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the 
Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or 
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal 
received. 
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes 
its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it 
is received and may be accepted. 
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government 
installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer 
wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, 
or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. 
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government 
processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated 
for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and 
urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other 
notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of 
offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the 
solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the 
exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral 
solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile 
offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the 
exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in 
the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in 
person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time 
set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is 
established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. 
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government 
intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with 
offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s 
best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government 
reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the 
Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all 
offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest 
offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an 
offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless 
otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities 
less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award 
on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices 
offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision 
substantially as follows: 
Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) 
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to 
the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most 
advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The 
following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Price 

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding 
the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. 
The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices 
are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the 
Government to exercise the option(s). 
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise 
furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in 
the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either

receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 
(End of Provision) 

OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen:
