<CONTACT>Leslie Leavitt Purchasing Agent 7022938642     LLeavitt@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Associated Cultural Resources Experts (ACRE), 8341 Sangre de Cristo Road, Suite 202, Littleton, Colorado 80127.  Reclamation proposes to conduct a Class III inventory of areas surrounding Hoover Dam to locate and document historic structures and archaeological sites associated with the construction and operation of Hoover Dam, and for HABS/HAER and other documentation to support consultation with the Nevada State Historic Preservation Officer concerning proposed renovation of the Old Exhibits Building at the Dam.  The proposed work is a continuation of historic resource surveys and documentation projects initiated under Interagency Agreement Nos. BOR #8-AA-30-00028 and BOR #00-AA-30-0079 between Reclamation and the Western Area Power Administration (Western).  Reclamation intends to award a contract for the proposed inventory and documentation work, without Western's involvement because the proposed work will be directed principally toward Reclamation owned and managed lands and facilities. ACRE has been working under a cooperative agreement between Reclamation and Western to document historic resources associated with Hoover Dam.  ACRE has also worked for the Federal Highways Administration, the Nevada Department of Transportation, and Lake Mead National Recreation Area on a number of projects in the vicinity of Hoover Dam and Boulder City.  During these previous projects, ACRE has conducted extensive archival research and field work leading to the documentation and evaluation of numerous facilities and elements of the historic infrastructure associated with construction and operation of the Dam.  As a part of these earlier projects, ACRE has consulted with the Nevada and Arizona State Historic Preservation Offices (SHPOs), the National Park Service's National Historic Landmarks and Historic American Engineering Records (HAER) Programs on the procedures and levels of documentaiton required by those offices and programs.  ACRE is also familiar with Reclamation's requirements and goals for this project.  Reclamation will save time and money by contracting with ACRE for this work because ACRE has already completed much of the background research, is extremely familiar with the historic facilities and structures that remain to be documented in the area identified for inventory and has a good understanding of the protocols involved in reporting their findings. This procurement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition procedures.  The anticipated award date is September 9, 2004.  All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  Offers shall show contractor's capability to provide the required work and quotes are to be submitted no later than September 3, 2004, 4:00 p.m., PST.  Responses to this notice should be mailed to Bureau of Reclamation, Attn:  Leslie Leavitt, PO Box 61470, Boulder City, NV   89006-1470 or sent via facsimile to (702) 293-8050.

<CONTACT>JEFFREY HAMMITT CONTRACT SPECIALIST 9162789341     ;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Western Region Branch of Acquisition and Grants (USGS) intends to issue a modification increasing the scope of task order # 02023W7118 under contract # 02WRCN0023 to the Environmental Careers Organization (ECO), located at 30 Winter Street, Boston, MA 02108-4720.  This action is to procure the professional managerial services of ECO, a non-profit organization, to provide the personal services of a student sciences intern under the authority of P.L. 106-113.  Under this authority, only non-profit organizations and accredited institutions of higher education may provide such services.  ECO is the only source that has expressed interest in the USGS Western Region's program, and the current employer of the student sciences intern in question.  Therefore, ECO is the only known source that can meet the Government's existing need to extend the term of service of this student sciences intern. This notification is provided to the public notwithstanding the prohibition at FAR 16.505(a)(1) that "The contracting officer does not synopsize orders under indefinite-delivery contracts."  Contract 02WRCN0023 has reached its maximum, and the proposed modification to task order 02023W7118 is considered a "contract action" as contemplated in FAR 5.001 as "actions for additional supplies or services outside the existing contract scope".  Because the aggregate value of this task order, including this proposed modification, will not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, the procedures of FAR part 13 apply.  Thus, as discussed above, the Government intends to award this action to ECO on a sole-source basis as "the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available", pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  Interested and qualified concerns who believe they can satisfy the Government's need shall deliver a capabilities statement to this contracting office no later than 5:00 P.M. on Monday, 06 September 2004.  The contracting officer shall evaluate submissions to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS; NO WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED AT THIS TIME.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this action. This notice and any resulting modification conform to the requirements in place through FAC 2001-24, dated 19 July 2004. For further information please contact Jeff Hammitt at (916) 278-9341 or jhammitt@usgs.gov.

The new facility is to be approximately 18,000 square feet.  The total estimated construction cost exceeds $4 million dollars. The Construction Manager (CM) will consult with the Architect/Engineer and The NIT staff during the design phases to provide cost estimating and to assure that the project will be designed in a cost effective and efficient and economical manner within budgetary limitations.  Prior to completion of design the Construction Manager (CM) will be required to submit a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for the construction of the facility.  If the GMP is accepted a contract will be entered into for the construction phase of the facility. Additional bid packages may be necessary due to proposed involvement of an Air Force Reserve civil engineering unit in some activities of the construction project.  The Construction Manager will be required to render supervisory and managerial services during construction, for which he will be paid a fee over and above the price covering the actual construction work.  A Performance Bond (100%) and Payment Bond 40% (not to exceed $2.5 Million Dollars) will be required of the CM prior to execution of the GMP Contract. Consideration for selection will be based on assessment of prior experience and qualifications using the following evaluation criteria: 1) Construction Management Experience, i.e., of the description used in the proposed contract; 2) Construction experience in the last five years on projects of similar size and scope to this project, i.e., health centers, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities; 3) Experience of Construction Manager's professional staff; 4) Cost Management and critical path scheduling experience; 5) Construction Contracting experience with Indian Organizations; 6) Management Plan; 7) Preference to Indian Owned Firms 8) Price.  Offerors are advised that technical quality is as important as price.  The Solicitation is expected to be available on or about September 10, 2004.  Request for solicitation package must be made in writing to Autumn leaf Spears, Director of Health and Human Services, Narragansett Indian Health Center, 4533 South County Trail, Charlestown, RI 02813, phone 401 364 1265, ext 10.

<DESC>Description:  SUBJECT:  ENGINEERING DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF A 4 GAS-FIRED BURNER SYSTEM. DESC: The U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to ENERCON Systems Inc., Elyria, OH for the following work (to be delivered to the U.S. Department of Energy, Albany Research Center, 1450 Queen Ave SW, Albany, OR 97321): STATEMENT OF WORK - 1.  Engineering design and fabrication of a 4 gas-fired burner system to include the capability to exchange conventional and regenerative burners on an existing and the new aluminum melting furnace.  This system must be completely compatible with the new, computational fluid dynamics-modeled 2 burner regenerative burner system just designed and fabricated. 2.  Furnish all necessary burners, controllers, mass flow controllers, gas train valving, regulators, metering, manual air and gas balancing apparatus, cabling, 2 regenerative burners, 3 paired intake and 3 paired exhaust blowers, 20 magnahelics, and piping for the new round top aluminum reverbratory furnace. END OF STATEMENT OF WORK. This purchase order is being issued to ENERCON Systems Inc., because the objective of this action is the engineering, design, fabrication, and training for operation of two, unique gas fired, regenerative/conventional burners, gas trains, blowers, and controls for installation on the new RAMF and the retrofit on the Experimental Reverbratory Furnace located at the Albany Research Center, Albany, OR.  Enercon Systems Inc is uniquely capable of performing this objective which entails the engineering of a four gas burner system to include the burners, gas trains, burners, and controls fro a new found aluminum melting furnace and the retrofitting of the capability of a regenerative burner system to replace the conventional burners, when desired, on an existing furnace. Enercon Systems Inc has been instrumental in the past in providing unique, gas-fired equipment for this area to include a truly unique thermal oxidizer; a hot blast (air preheating system) that will be the heart of the new regenerative burner system; the design and engineering of our state-of-the-art air pollution control system for this building; and the design and fabrication of the current regenerative/conventional tow burner system for the new round aluminum melting furnace (RAMF) and ERF.  All of this work and the apparatus associated with it is complex and will have to be designed to be assimilated into the current aluminum melting capability in Bldg 34.  Not only will the system have to be designed to fit the current and furnace, but the burner systems will have to be procured from a number of dissimilar sources and carefully engineered to fit both the existing systems and the new furnace. Because of the research nature of these furnaces, the systems will have to be designed to work efficiently using both conventional burners, but it will be necessary to, with an absolute minimum amount of work, to convert the two aluminum melters to use a set of 4 regenerative burners on the new RAMF and 2 on the ERF.  This requires specialized knowledge of the existing systems, CFD, engineering design, and the capabilities needed for the new melting and curing furnaces and Enercon Systems has this knowledge.  The only entity with this unique capability is Enercon Systems Inc.  No other company would be able to do this work without undertaking a long, and steep learning curve.  Enercon Systems Inc has the unique personnel to complete the requirement being purchased the Albany Research Center. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.  Offerors shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc., in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as meeting technical acceptability.  Therefore, no solicitation will result the announcement. This award shall be made using FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770. The Technical Representative for the above requirement is Mr. Paul Turner at 541-967-5863.  All bids, proposals, or quotations must be submitted by 5:00 PM Eastern Time, September 10, 2004.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences intends to award a sole source purchase order to NC State University Sponsored Programs, Raleigh, NC, pursuant to 41-U.S.C. 253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This study is an ongoing collaborative project between NIEHS and NCSU in building gene expression discriminant models with statistical frameworks.  NCSU will provide expert assistance in creating pattern recognition methodologies with statistical models tied to associated biological/toxicological information and gene functional annotation for predicting classes of biological samples exposed to toxicant agents or exhibiting variations in biological mechanisms.  Using computer software, database systems, computational procedures and statistical analyses, the development of a data mining system for identification of biomarkers of toxicity shall be pursued and delivered within a year of the contract award.  Interrogation of gene regulatory networks or pathways and sequence-based identification/validation of disciminators shall be essential for characterization of genes and gene networks implicated in adverse toxic effects.  Highly reliable genetic networks with statistical probabilities tied to gene interactions shall be constructed from NIEHS' gene expression data.    The nature of this work is highly specialized and multidisciplinary in nature necessitating close and regular interactions with members of a multidisciplinary team.  Physical proximity to NEIHS is essential.  It requires internationally recognized expertise in bioinformatics and broad skills and knowledge in Bayesian conditional probability and mathematical statistics, statistical theory, biology and genetics, database development, computer programming (Java, C++, Matlab, SAS and SQL), data mining, pattern recognition and genome sequence analysis.  All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 10 days of date of notice to Elaine Shoaf at the above address or fax 919 541-5117 for consideration by the agency.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.

<DESC>This is an amendment to synopsis N6339404R4009 posted 14 January 2004.  The purpose of this amendment is to restate the small business set-aside requirements.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business with cascading set-aside provisions.   The hierarchy of the business types is that small businesses shall take precedence over large businesses.  Proposals from large businesses will only be considered if the government does not receive offers from two qualified small business firms.  The complete details of the cascading set-aside will be stated in the solicitation document. The solicitation invokes an event-based security qualification procedure where offeror's security qualifications are evaluated at three points to ensure only authorized offerors receive access to classified material (the Statement Of Work (SOW) and only offerors who meet security requirements and who can commence performance at the time of award are considered for award.  The three-phase! d events are: (1) qualification (clearance and need-to-know) to receive the SOW, (2) qualification at time of proposal submission and (3) qualification at time of award.  The successful offeror must meet the security requirements for each event and must maintain the required security requirements throughout performance of the contract.  A unclassified or sanitized version of the SOW will not be provided because of (a) the cost of providing various matrixes of documents that may be requested, (b) offerors not receiving the entire SOW will not be responsive and (c) the event based qualification procedure specifies higher standards than the SOW classification level. To be eligible to receive the SOW and to be eligible for contract award, the following security requirements and information requirements must be met.    (Reference: National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) DoD 5225.22-M). SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: (A) have a Defense Security Service (DSS) issued ! facility clearance providing for TOP SECRET personnel clearances and SECRET safeguarding. Such facility clearance must be unrestricted, that is not be under a special security agreement or have any restrictions on access to TOP SECRET, communication security services, cryptographic materials and equipment, Restricted Data or Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and; (B) have an appointed Contractor Special Security Officer (CSSO). REQUIRED DATA: (1) Cage Code (2) Legal Name, Known Name (if different) (3) Physical Address (4) Level of Clearance (personnel clearances authorized must be final TOP SECRET with DCID 6/4 certification (5) Storage/Safeguarding Level (must be SECRET or above) (6) Status of Clearance (must be active – final and favorably adjudicated within the past five years) (7) Facility Security Officer name/phone (8) Classified Mailing Address (9) Cognizant DSS Office location (10) DSS Industrial Security Representative name/phone and (11) a copy of the CSSO ! designation letter. If the designation letter is not government issued, the offeror must also include objective evidence of the source of government authority to make such a designation. All multiple locations require separate submissions for the facility to which the SOW shall be sent. Offerors are cautioned that this information will be verified with the DSS Central Verification Activity (CVA) located at www.dss.mil and any inaccuracies may result in a determination of not qualified to receive the SOW. The above information shall be sent via mail or other carrier to: Special Security Representative (SSR), Naval Surface Warfare Center, 160 Rochester Dr, Louisville, KY 40214-2685 and MUST BE RECEIVED by the SSR on or before close of business, 4:00 pm EST,  09 September 2004.  All offerors are cautioned that the date for receipt of the required security information is firm and will not be extended.  All offerors who previously submitted security information in response to this synopsis must resubmit the required information to be considered.  This address is approved for receipt of classified up to SECRET level.  Offerors may contact the SSR at (502) 417-3396 if a higher-level submission is required.  Failure to furnish accurate and complete information will result in the offeror being ineligible to receive the classified SOW and will render the offeror ineligible to receive contract award.  For offerors who are cleared to receive the SOW, the following security documents will be provided: (1) A DD254 Contract Security Specification authorizing possession of the classified SOW and production of a classified proposal not to exceed the SECRET/NOFORN level and (2) an additional DD254 authorizing higher-level submission upon reques! t and satisfaction of supplementary security requirements. Sponsorship will not be provided for new or upgraded facility clearances. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for the procurement is 541330 and the size standard is $23 million dollars.  The proposed acquisition will be a cost plus fixed fee with award term provisions not to exceed 60 months.  Questions regarding this requirement should be faxed to Ms. Ann Marie Hagan at (805) 228-6298, electronic mail is not authorized.  The anticipated release date of the solicitation is 16 September 2004.  Upon release, the solicitation will be available at http://www.phdnswc.navy.mil/procurements/.  This release will not include the SOW.  Copies of the SOW will only be provided to offerors who meet the security requirements.  The closing date for receipt of offers is 19 October 2004.  Note 1 applies.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Molecular Medicine and Virology Section (MMVS), Laboratory of Molecular Medicine and Neuroscience  (LMMN) plans to procure, on a sole source basis from Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc (One Zeiss Drive, Thornwood, NY 10594), an Apotome-upgrade for an existing Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope that will convey confocal imaging capabilities. The North American Industry Classification System Code for Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The Laboratory of Molecular Medicine and Neuroscience (LMMN), investigates the biology of viral infections in nervous system cells derived from human brain and the molecular regulation which controls cellular and viral gene expression.  This request is necessary to allow for more accurate and detailed examinations of the virus-cell interactions central to LMMN studies.  Lytic JCV infection of oligodendrocytes causes the fatal demyelinating disease, Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), which occurs almost exclusively in immune compromised individuals, particularly with AIDS.  Equipment required for this request includes an Apotome- upgrade for the existing Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope, Axiovision software upgrade modules, a Zeiss imaging workstation, and computer hardware add-ons (memory upgrade, RAID controller, and 160 GIG hard disk).   The Zeiss Apotome-upgrade with imaging accessories will advance the existing Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope with confocal capabilities.  This will eliminate the need to purchase a separate and significantly more costly confocal microscope.  The acquisition will enhance acuity and accuracy of imaging on the existing scope, by conveying abilities to precisely locate objects of interest within a cell and determine whether multiple objects of interest are co-localized.  Carl Zeiss MicroImaging is the only source known to NINDS that can provide the instrument required for the research.  This instrument is vastly important to the LMMN's study of virus-cell interactions.  There are no other known companies that manufacture the Apotome, or comparable imaging technologies that work with the existing microscope.  The Apotome-upgrade hardware and software included in this requisition is patented by Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.  The Zeiss Apotome-upgrades are the only components made that convey confocal abilities to the existing Axiovert 200M microscope.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, September 10, 2004.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please state solicitation number NCI-40145-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with The Pennsylvania State University based on an unsolicited proposal to improve the quality of the FLECHT (Full Length Emergency Core Cooling Heat Transfer) , and the FLECHT-Separate Effects and Systems Effects experimental data residing in the NRC Reflood Heat Transfer Data Bank by adding important information such as data channel definitions, heat flux, and void fractions, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)2(i).  The proposed Principal Investigator for this effort is the same individual that developed the original FLECHT and FLECHT-SEASET data base 30 years ago, as a consulting engineer for Westinghouse Electric Corporation.  Based on the knowledge of the original data and having access to the original  data as a result of a former long tenure as consulting engineer with Westinghouse, the Principal Investigator was able to determine a way to correct the current deficiencies.  The Principal Investigator proposes to perform a series of calculations based on the original test data and using special computer programs (e.g. CATALOG, FFLOWS, FLEMB, and DATARH) to produce the needed information.  A cost-type purchase order utilizing the procedures under FAR Part 13 is contemplated.  The period of performance is one year from date of award.  This notice of intent is neither a request for quotes or a solicitation of offers.  Interested firms must submit written capability statements demonstrating their ability to perform the required services to the above address not later than 15 calendar days from the date this announcement appears in the Federal Business Opportunities.  Capability statements that do not fully demonstrate the respondent’s ability to satisfy the requirements above will not be considered.

The University of North Carolina
At Chapel Hill’s Shep Center is an evaluation contractor with unique abilities, knowledge and history required by HRSA’s Bureau of Primary Health Care in developing an objective, external evaluation of the impact analysis and review criteria to evaluate applicants for new starts and expansions.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 561990   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) National Enforcement Investigations Center intends to award a sole source fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1. The purpose of this acquisition is to renew EPA's annual materials handling license.   The NAICS Code for this procurement is 561990.  EPA's NEIC currently is in possession of radioactive sources which are utilized in the detections and  measurement of radioactive materials.  Since EPA possesses these radioactive resources, EPA must abide by the regulations of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, CFR 10, Part 30 which sets forth the requirements of a materials license.  Since the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is the only  organization with the authority to grant U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission materials licenses, it has been determined that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is the only viable source to meet the Government's requirements.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the  proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This effort is estimated to be below the $25,000 threshold.  All questions should be directed to Carole Britt via e-mail at britt.carole@epa.gov.

This acquisition is for services to develop and provide technical assistance to 13 of the combined 103 Multiple Behavioral Risk Factor grantees, Family Violence grantees and Health Start Programs overseen by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau’s Division of Perinatal Systems and Women’s Health (DPSWH), HRSA.   The technical assistance (TA) shall be provided to enhance the capacity of providers to screen for and educate their clients about family violence and to improve linkages between screening sites and community-based intervention programs for women experiencing family violence during or around the time of pregnancy.  Of the 13 sites that receive TA, a maximum of four (4) may have also received TA in 2003-2004 through the MCHB TA Contract.   The technical assistance provided shall include the following four components: (1) A technical assistance written needs assessment prior to site visit, (2) Developmental of a technical assistance plan for enhancement or provider capacity to screen and for effective linkages between perinatal domestics violence screening sites and essential community intervention programs, (3) Two-three days of on-site technical assistance (TA) to implement the technical assistance plan, and (4) Follow-up phone and or electronic consultation to each site that receives TA.  The FVPF is the only organization with extensive experience working with diverse populations including African American, Filipino, Latino and recent immigrants, which mirror the populations serviced by the DPSWH grants.  The FVPF is recognized leader in developing partnership between health care, criminal justice, employers and publics assistance programs and has developed several propriety materials that directly relate to the technical assistance needed to enhance linkages between screening sites and community-based inventions programs for women experiencing family violence during or around the time of pregnancy.  FVPF is the only organization with the experience, proprietary materials and diversity of experience that is able to provide deliverables at a rate that eliminates development of completely new needs assessment, training, and evaluating materials that have not been previously evaluated in the grants served by DPSWH.  FVPF is the only vendor with the breadth of expertise to effectively tailor technical assistance to each grantee as well as substantially reduce duplication of costs by utilizing proprietary tools in the delivery of technical assistance.Any other organization that attempts to develop this type of proprietary material and diversity of expertise would have to replicate their previous accomplishments. This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would be recovered through competition, therefore, the Family Violence Protection Fund, is a responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S. C. 253 ( c ), (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a solicitation and published for information purposes only.  A copy of the Justification for Other Than Full and O pen Competition is on file.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Please See NOTE 22.  The US Army has undertaken the task to fully deploy the Army Golden Master (AGM) across the entire United States Army network infrastructure via the previously awarded software release management services contract, which was in s upport of the Armys MS Enterprise License Agreement (MS ELA) contract.  The AGM establishes a consistent hardened desktop and server image, consisting of specific MS products, to be leveraged by all organizations in the Army.  A single AGM provides increa sed manageability and security to the Army.  The US Army Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM)/Enterprise Systems Technology Activity (ESTA) will ensure the deployed solution is integrated across the Army enterprise, then manage, operate and provi de continue improvement and configuration management of the AGM.  MS has provided consulting services to various Army commands and activities for the deployment and maintenance of MS solutions for many years.  MS obviously is in a unique position to provid e support to NETCOM/ESTA AGM effort to include priorities such as Windows XP and Office 2003 deployment.  MS consulting services will focus on assisting NETCOM/ESTA in streamlining the workstation/server build and imaging process, workstation-hardening pro cess, and data migration process for legacy workstations migrating to the new platform.Since the services to be rendered under this contract requires direct access to MS S/W source code, key business processes and scheduled new product release dates, any e ffort to obtain competition would not be successful.  No other vendor has access to MS S/W source code, key business processes and scheduled new product release dates other than MS itself.  Microsoft consultants will provide world-class technical expertise , enterprise experience and project management skills during the envisioning, planning, developing, stabilization and implementation phases of this effort.  Inclusion of MS increases the likelihood of successful implementation of the over all AGM goals and  objectives. The proposed source (Microsoft) is the only source that can provide the service required by the U.S. Army.  Furthermore, MS is the only vendor that has provided written or verbal interest in this effort.  To date, no other sources have express ed written or verbal interest.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) is seeking a qualified golf course developer to develop and operate, under a ground lease, the White Oak Golf Course within the Federal Research Center (FRC) at White Oak in Silver Spring, Maryland. 

GSA has identified three objectives for the development and operation of the White Oak Golf Course. These objectives are: 
1. Leveraging private sector experience, resources, and capital to manage and redevelop the golf course while maintaining the integrity of the FDA complex and preserving a historic resource. 
2. Enhancing community interaction with the golf course by facilitating outreach between the golf course developer and the local community. 
3. Using the Cooperative Use Act to increase the value of the golf course to the community and the government.
This Request for Qualifications (RFQ) represents an opportunity for developers that are interested in being considered for the development and operation of the White Oak Golf Course under a ground lease.  The RFQ stage is the first stage in a two-stage selection process (see Section V.A.).  The objective of this RFQ stage is to identify the most highly qualified developers based on key factors that include:

1.	Developer and Developers Key Personnel Experience 
2.	Developer Financial Capacity and Capability 
3.	Developer and Developerfs Key Personnel Past Performance 
4.	Developers Vision and/or Strategy for Development/Operation of White Oak Golf Course 

In the Requests for Proposals (RFP) stage, GSA will issue an RFP to the Short-List of qualified developers that are identified at the RFQ stage. 

---Please note: this RFQ document represents your only opportunity to be qualified and placed on the short list for the RFP.  ---

The idea to seek a private developer/operator for the White Oak Golf Course comes at a great time for those interested in responding to this RFQ.  It is anticipated that the potential customer base for White Oak Golf Course will continue to grow tremendously over the next five years.

--- Pre-Submission Tours are scheduled for September 9 and 14, 2004, at 10:00.  Please contact Sheldon Jobe, 202/260-0767, to confirm space availability.---

<DESC>This is an amendment to ESI40422 posted August 26, 2004, with a response date of September 6, 2004.  The response date should have been August 31, 2004.  The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences intends to modify an existing purchase order to NC State University Sponsored Programs, Raleigh, NC, pursuant to 41-U.S.C. 253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This study is an ongoing collaborative project between NIEHS and NCSU in building gene expression discriminant models with statistical frameworks.  NCSU will provide expert assistance in creating pattern recognition methodologies with statistical models tied to associated biological/toxicological information and gene functional annotation for predicting classes of biological samples exposed to toxicant agents or exhibiting variations in biological mechanisms.  Using computer software, database systems, computational procedures and statistical analyses, the development of a data mining system for identification of biomarkers of toxicity shall be pursued and delivered within a year of the contract award.  Interrogation of gene regulatory networks or pathways and sequence-based identification/validation of disciminators shall be essential for characterization of genes and gene networks implicated in adverse toxic effects.  Highly reliable genetic networks with statistical probabilities tied to gene interactions shall be constructed from NIEHS' gene expression data.    The nature of this work is highly specialized and multidisciplinary in nature necessitating close and regular interactions with members of a multidisciplinary team.  Physical proximity to NEIHS is essential.  It requires internationally recognized expertise in bioinformatics and broad skills and knowledge in Bayesian conditional probability and mathematical statistics, statistical theory, biology and genetics, database development, computer programming (Java, C++, Matlab, SAS and SQL), data mining, pattern recognition and genome sequence analysis.  All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 5 days of date of notice to Elaine Shoaf at the above address or fax 919 541-5117 for consideration by the agency.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.   If no affirmative responses are received within 5 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with NCSU Sponsored Programs.  The NAICS Code/Size is 541690/$6.0M.  This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Elaine Shoaf via email shoaf1@niehs.nih.gov.

<DESC>Market Research for the Expedited Modernization Initiative Procedure EMIP Process Introduction The Project Manager Tactical Vehicles (PM-TV) is committed to the goals and performance of a Joint Expeditionary Force, focusing on increasing the relevance and readiness of our Tactical Wheeled Vehicle TWV fleet, and ensuring that the best possible produc t is available to support the current force and beyond.  The EMIP is a multi-phased, continuous process designed to improve the current and future TWV fleet by identifying and leveraging industrys investments in advanced technologies, and to allow for ins ertion of these technologies as quickly as possible. The EMIP process offers to the Government and the contractor: ·	A single point of contact with coordinated reviews. ·	The capabilities to more rapidly take advantage of innovations in technology. ·	The flexibility and agility to both take advantage of capabilities offered by rapidly changing technologies as well as to meet the challenges imposed by GWOT and the requirement to transform to a modular, expeditionary Army. The current TWV fleet is composed of the M915 Series of Trucks, Palletized Load System or PLS, Heavy Equipment Transporter or HET, Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck or HEMTT, Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles or FMTV, and High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) families of vehicles, as well as all associated trailers. This process applies to those vehicles that PM TV manages.  The Tank-automotive & Armaments Command TACOM Integrated Logistics Support Center or ILSC manages vehicles no long er in production as well as all spares.  Suggestions concerning vehicles no longer in production and managed by ILSC will be directed to the appropriate item manager.  Market Research for Technological Capabilities for Tactical Wheeled Vehicles: PM TV is seeking technology that will improve the capabilities of the current fleet with regard to agility/versatility, deployability, responsiveness, sustainability, and survivability to support continuous future force operations with the right products a t the right time for the right price.  Although all ideas/concepts to improve the fleet will be considered, this process will only address those technologies that can be available for production within six months of completion of verification testing.  Contractor submissions will be given consideration based on a number of characteristics, both in terms of cost and performance.  Such consideration will focus on numerous factors including the extent of the technological relevance in relation to current Go vernment needs and/or technological reduction in life cycle costs. The following are examples of capabilities desired non-prioritized list: ·	Increased range/fuel efficiency ·	Increased reliability ·	On-Board Diagnostics ·	Increased Service Intervals ·	Reduced Number of Tools ·	Reduced Non-operator organic maintenance tasks ·	Decreased Mean Time To Repair or MTTR ·	Reduced Operator/Maintenance  Training ·	Force Protection ·	Mobility ·	Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance C4ISR ·	Human Factors Technology priorities are as follows: Technologies applicable to the Global War on Terrorism GWOT, Operation Iraqi Freedom OIF Operation Enduring Freedom OEF applications  ·	 Enhancements in present vehicle capabilities growth from Threshold to Objective requirements. Review of the technology capability will focus on a comparison of capabilities offered by the technology as compared to vehicle specifications and applicable Operational Requirements Document ORD/Capabilities Program Document CPD/Capabilities Development D ocument CDD requirements.  These documents can be made available by request.  Process The contractor will make his initial submission to the Government via Mailbox TruckTech@tacom.army.mil mailto:TruckTech@tacom.army.mil.  The concept submitted mus t be at Technology Readiness Level TRL 8 or better.  This is defined as an actual system completed and qualified through test and demonstration.  The format for this submission will be IAW Appendix A.  Once the Government confirms receipt, the EMIP process  will continue as follows:  ·	Review of the technology capability will be done within 30 days of receipt. ·	The Government will review for applicability as well as technical readiness level. ·	If the Government determines that the technology is appropriate for demonstration, it will provide a recommendation for demonstration and/or request for additional data. ·	If the Government determines that the proposal is not a candidate for the EMIP process, then a recommendation will be provided to the contractor as to the appropriate disposition. In the event that it has been determined that a demonstration is appropriate, there are two options available.   First, it must be stressed that all such demonstrations are both optional and at the expense of the contractor.  The demonstration of items will in no way express or imply an obligation by the Government to purchase or otherwise acquire the items demonstra ted or displayed.  Moreover, the Government is not bound or obligated in any way to give special consideration to any demonstrating vendor on future contracts as a result of the EMIP process or demonstration.   The value of the demonstrations is that contractors can provide a much more persuasive case for the technology than can be provided by written documentation alone. The following are the different variations of the demonstrations:  ·	Government Rodeo Annual - The rodeos are a formal demonstration which will be offered each year in the Jan-Feb timeframe.  The initial rodeo will be conducted at the Nevada Automotive Test or NATC in the same week as the TWV conference and Army leadershi p will be in attendance. Although the EMIP process is a continuous process and white papers can be submitted at any time during the calendar year,  white papers should be submitted NLT 1 November 2004 if participation in the Feb 2005 rodeo is desired.  Thi s will allow enough time for demonstration arrangements to be made between the contractor and NATC.  Contractors should request NATC facilities after submitting their white papers to the government.  NATC will give priority of test and lab facilities to co ntractors whose white papers have already been received.  More detail on the rodeo is provided in Appendix B. ·	Alternative demo Continuous - Location to be determined by contractor with Government concurrence e.g.: Government proving ground, private proving ground, contractors facility.  This alternative offers more flexibility for schedule; however Government p articipation will be more limited than with the scheduled rodeos because only one demonstration will be ongoing. Upon completion of the demonstration the Government will make an internal acquisition approach decision. Conclusion: The key advantage of this process is that it provides a focused, standardized approach to introducing new capabilities to PM Tactical Vehicles.

Eleven Mile Road Warren, MI  48397-5000 Appendix B:  Technology Rodeo #1 The first Annual Technology Rodeo will be held at the Nevada Automotive Test Center (NATC) in February 05.  The EMIP Process will be the primary source for candidate technologies to be presented at the rodeo.  The rodeo will allow the most promising compon ent technology developers or manufacturers to demonstrate their products in front of key acquisition, test and R&D representatives.  This first rodeo will address component technologies rather than complete vehicle systems. These will be technologies which will be suitable for incorporation on either current or future vehicle systems.  The priorities and types of technologies are in the  EMIP announcement. An opportunity to demonstrate complete vehicle systems is expected to be provided in a later rodeo FY06 for which details will be announced at a later date.    In order to gain entry into the Technology Rodeo process, the following steps apply: ·	Contractors must first submit information requested in the EMIP announcement outlining their concept and perceived benefits to the EMIP mailbox TruckTech@tacom.army.mil mailto:PM-TVIndustryMailbox@tacom.army.mil.  Specific submission requirements are sho wn in Appendix A.  In order to be eligible for the first rodeo at NATC in Feb 2005, white paper submissions should be received NLT 1 Nov 2004. ·	If the Government has decided that the concept is at the appropriate technology level and the contractor wants it to be demonstrated at the rodeo, the contractor at his option and expense would contact the organizer NDIA for registration. ·	Once this registration is completed the contractor would enter into discussions with NATC in order to begin planning the actual demonstration.  NATC contact information will be provided at a later date.  At this time details concerning test courses, requ ired labs and support and expenses would be worked out.  All costs for this portion will be worked out directly between NATC and the contractor.  The contractor is solely responsible for the design and conduct of the demonstration as well as all associated  costs. ·	The only participants for the process will be demonstrators and either Government personnel or Government support contractor personnel.  ·	In order to allow sufficient time for planning and preparation, it is necessary for the contractor to register with NDIA and contact NATC NLT 8 Nov 2004 if the contractor wants to participate in the first rodeo.  Entrance into the process after this poin t will be handled on a case by case basis by PM TV representatives.  Utilization of NATC test facilities and labs will be handled on a first-come, first-serve basis depending on white paper submittal to the government. ·	Demonstration/Rodeo Agreement/Release Form must be signed and submitted prior to participation in the Demonstration or Rodeo.

The Virology Quality Assurance (VQA) Program is critical to the scientific integrity of on-going and future studies concerning HIV diagnosis, disease progression, assessment of treatment, vaccine efficacy and other preventive measures.  The VQA has been in operation since 1988 and has developed and standardized quality control procedures for approximately 25 virologic assays used in DAIDS-sponsored clinical trials.  DAIDS is seeking capability statements from organizations capable of performing the following tasks:  (1) implement standards of performance for existing and newly developed virologic assays and assess the ability of Sites to successfully perform the assays; (2) conduct studies on the adaptation, standardization and application of new and existing virologic and biostatistic methodologies; (3) acquire, characterize, store, document and disburse quality control materials and reagents to include biohazardous materials and infectious agents; (4) disseminate Virology Quality Assessment technical and scientific data; (5) maintain computerized software systems that support the VQA Program; and (6) expand services to include additional Sites when necessary through exercise of Options.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITIES RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS AN 8(a) SET-ASIDE; 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE OR AS FULL AND OPEN. ALL SIZE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES. To ensure the validity and inter- and intra-laboratory comparability of virologic laboratory data obtained from DAIDS-supported clinical trials and HIV natural history studies, the contractor will continue a program for "Real-Time Assay Validation," where known quality control materials (QCMs) are tested by VQA-supported laboratories (Sites) in parallel with patient samples to ensure the validity of each assay “run.”  The contractor will also conduct a "Proficiency Testing" (PT) program, where unknown QCMs are tested by the Sites to periodically monitor Site assay performance.  The contractor will provide participating Sites with standardized reagents and controls for conducting research aimed at development and evaluation of virologic and statistical methodologies.  The VQA Program will serve current and future DAIDS-sponsored clinical trial networks and collaborating study groups (User Groups).  Currently supported User Groups include: the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (AACTG), the Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG), the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN), the Women and Infants Transmission Study (WITS), the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS), the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), the Community Program for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA), the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), the Comprehensive International Program of Research on AIDS (CIPRA), the Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program (AIEDRP), as well as other domestic and international individual grantees.  Collaborations are anticipated with CDC Global AIDS Program (GAP)-affiliated laboratories supporting the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) activities.  Currently, the VQA program serves approximately 55 domestic and 25 international Sites.  The base contract is expected to cover these 80 Sites.  Although the structure of the clinical trial networks is subject to change during the contract period, the changes are not expected to result in changes to the number of participating Sites in the base contract.  However, the Government anticipates a need to expand the number of Sites during the course of the contract, and such an increase in the contractor’s activities may be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as one or more Options in each of the contract years.  The work to be performed under this contract is currently being carried out by Rush Presbyterian – St. Luke’s Medical, under contract N01-AI-85354 and is expected to be completed on September 20, 2005.  All capability statements will be evaluated against related ability and experience for providing this type and magnitude of support; available qualified personnel; corporate experience and existing facilities and resources. It is anticipated that this contract will be for a 7-year period of performance and require an estimated 9 to 19 FTEs with expertise consistent with the operations of a project of this size and complexity. All interested organizations should submit two (2) copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above. Please respond as directed by Government-Wide Numbered Notes 25 and 26. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

A potential licensing opportunity exists with BBWI, the prime operating contractor for the Department of Energy (DOE) at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL).  BBWI is soliciting a written indication of interest from industrial partners interested in entering into a license agreement for the purpose of commercializing the technology described below.  This is not an opportunity to provide goods or services to BBWI or DOE.  This solicitation will close to response 30 days after publication.  Interested parties should send a description of their company and their plans to commercialize this technology to the following address:

INVENTION SUMMARY:

Bechtel BWXT of Idaho Inc., LLC (BBWI) has developed a method for co-extraction of cesium and strontium from acidic solutions using a mixture of commercially available crown ether and calixarene extractants that exhibit high radiation and chemical stability.  This is an efficient solvent extraction process for the simultaneous removal of cesium and strontium from dissolved spent nuclear fuel and acidic nuclear waste streams.  Combined use of these two extractants in one process represents a novel approach to partitioning these elements in a single, convenient manner.  Simultaneous solvent extraction of these radioactive elements is desirable for waste management concerns because the process provides; purified cesium and strontium in a form easily concentrated or solidified, high levels of decontamination, high removal factors and a simplified chemical scheme.  Removal of cesium and strontium from commercial spent nuclear fuel waste streams has numerous benefits.  This process will be more easily employed and produces less secondary wastes than that of current cesium/strontium extractants under consideration.    It would replace existing solvents used in competing small-scale tests that have negative attributes in a large-scale process.

<CONTACT>Timothy Starker 202 781 3944
<DESC>Purpose The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) from all interested companies who may be interested in the development and manufacturing of high energy density capacitors for use in high-energy weapons systems, including electromagnetic railgun projectile launch.  The Navy is currently developing proof of concept hardware that employs energy storage and pulse generation that can be attained through the use of capacitors in a land based demonstrator.  The Description Section provides a set of performance characteristics that have been developed to meet the needs of the demonstration system.  This technology may also be examined for a potential application to a shipboard railgun system. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. This RFI in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies. The information provided will assist NAVSEA in developing and further defining future procure! ment and acquisition strategies. DESCRIPTION: The specification for the type of capacitors desired is as follows: 4 terminal dual capacitor enclosure with each capacitor in the enclosure having a capacitance of 4080 micro-Farads, tolerance +/- 5%, 5650 volts rated per capacitor with a test voltage up to 6150 volts per capacitor, 30,000 volts from winding to the case, 130 kJ rated energy storage, energy density greater than 1 J/cc, 10% rated voltage reversal, 35 kA rated peak current, design life of 10,000 charge/discharge cycles (defined as a loss of 5% of capacitance), 100 hours DC design life, reliability of 90% at rated life, 200 nH maximum inductance, 15 milliohm maximum resistance, 180 second maximum time to full charge, maximum dimensions 13.5"W x 16" D x 36" H, and 10C to 40C operating temperature. Responses Defense and commercial contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate. Foreign and domestic supplies will be considered equally.  Responses to this RFI should be limited to 5 pages or less (including any amendments) and include supporting materials that allows an effective evaluation of your company's competence, experience, and overall  understanding of the scope of work that NAVSEA has identified.  Submissions should include company history, company size, major products, primary customer base, points of contacts (able to discuss the submitted materials), and a description of past experience. Contractors are to provide information pertaining to unit costs, present manufacturing capacity, and possible delivery timelines, especially provide evidence of how they intend to be responsive to urgent and short lead-time requirements.  Contractors are to provide their plans for the development of capacitors that would meet this requirement. Contractors are also encouraged to provide in their responses, the type and number of tradespersons that they have available for work that they intend to perform.   Responses are requested by 10:00 am (EST), on 15 September 2004 to support the Government's milestone objectives.  However, submissions will be accepted after this date but feedback may not be as timely or contribute to NAVSEA's strategic planning.  Information should be e-mailed to Joseph Tannebaum at tannenbaumj@navsea.navy.mil or mailed to Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: Mr. Joseph Tannebaum, PMS-500I, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue SE Stop 2030, Washington Navy Yard, D.C., 20376-2030.  Questions can be submitted electronically to tannenbaumj@navsea.navy.mil.  Information provided shall be treated as Business Sensitive and will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies without the permission of the provider.  All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government. NAVSEA may request further information regarding the capabilities of respondents to meet the requirements and may request a presentation and/or a site visit as deemed necessary.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice.  

The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is considering issuing a future contract to support key aspects of its broad and varied public affairs and information dissemination efforts. NIMH is attempting to identify sources with experience and expertise in communications planning, media relations, media training, development and dissemination of publications-both print and electronic, educational campaigns, market research (i.e., focus groups), recruitment for clinical trials, select graphic design tasks, evaluation of communications efforts, and close coordination and cooperation between NIMH Office of Communications and Public Liaison(OCPL) and other NIMH contractors.  OCPL strives to increase awareness of mental health issues, educate the public about breakthroughs in research and the basic science of mental illness, and promote prevention efforts.  The mental disorders to be dealt with under this contract are quite diverse.  They include depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), borderline personality disorder, autism, eating disorders, and Alzheimer's disease.  The Contractor to be selected for this requirement must have a good understanding of contemporary mental health issues (including stigma), must communicate interest in and commitment to addressing these issues, must be prepared to work with OCPL in devising strategies to guide each aspect of the OCPL program, and must be able to adjust these strategies on short notice.  Also, the Contractor must be able to advise on and assist in maintaining the corporate image of the Institute, through the NIMH Web site www.nimh.nih.gov, publications, media events, and knowledgeable staffing at exhibits, if needed.
 

The four (4) major objectives to be accomplished through this contract are:

 

1.     On an ongoing basis, develop and implement media outreach strategies, making effective use of media inquiries, press conferences, science writer's seminars, press releases, video news releases, satellite media tours, media advisories, Op-Ed pieces, interviews, stories, etc.

 

2.     Develop, produce, and user-test information materials and educational campaigns for the following audiences:

 

*      The mass media

*      The general public (including those with and without mental disorders and their significant others, friends and family members)

*      Specific populations (including minority groups such as African Americans and Hispanics; children and adolescents; low-literacy audiences; women; and college-aged youth)

*      Mental health care providers

*      Primary health care providers

*      Business and industry

3.     Market NIMH materials through a wide variety of outlets and intermediaries, including the web, conferences, meetings, advocacy groups, organizations and associations, foundations.

4.     Evaluate, track, and monitor media placements and other outreach efforts.

 

NIMH will require a contractor for this requirement that:

1.     has extensive experience in effectively conducting large-scare, national health education programs of scope and complexity;

2.     has the ability to deal with the nuances of public service advertising and educational programs based on scientific studies, particularly on health topics;

3.     has expertise in primary and secondary research (data gathering, analysis, and synthesis);

4.     has extensive knowledge of the principles and practices of social marketing (e.g., understanding target audiences, designing communications strategies based on their needs, and communicating messages through multiple channels);

5.     can effectively and efficiently manage the various activities that must be conducted simultaneously to successfully accomplish the program;

6.     has the creative ability to develop highly innovative materials that can effectively compete for a finite amount of air time and newspaper/magazine space with ads for commercial products (such as soft drinks and athletic shoes) as well as with other public service campaigns on such topics as drug abuse, AIDS, and cancer; and

7.     has the technical expertise to develop and implement innovative-as well as traditional-communications methods, marketing strategies, and distribution channels, so that health care and mental health professionals, as well as the general public, will become more aware of Mental Health disorders and their treatability.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notices are issued by USAID in performing market research to determine industry interest and capabilities. This is not a Request for Quote. USAID is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Sources Sought Notice.
	
USAID is seeking sources capable of providing program management support services to support the USAID Program Management Office (PMO).  The PMO has been in operation for over one year and provides support to the Agency’s major Business Systems Modernization (BSM) Information Technology (IT) initiatives including deployment of the financial and procurement systems overseas; and development of the Enterprise Architecture. The PMO also plays a major role in defining the Agency’s role in e-Government projects.  As the PMO progresses in its maturity from start-up to execution, it will require contractor support to implement the use of Program, Portfolio, and Project Management industry best practices and PMO thought leadership. The contractor seeking to offer USAID services must be capable of achieving the following objectives to efficiently, effectively, and economically provide and maintain a world-class PMO to support USAID employees in meeting USAID’s mission:

a.	Provide an advanced set of PMO services, under a performance-based arrangement, with maximum impact on the Agency’s ability to perform its mission at a lower total cost for IT support, to meet budget, schedule and quality goals.

1.	Apply a Program Integrator’s approach to governance of the decision making process to ensure that information technology investments integrate strategic planning, budgeting, procurement, and management of IT in support of USAID’s mission, strategic focus, and business needs.
2.	Ensure consistent standards, templates and processes are being used by all major IT projects within the BSM program.
3.	Assure that all PMO programs are aligned to the business goals and strategies of USAID throughout the program life-cycle.
4.	Supplement PMO Government staff technical knowledge and provide special expertise, periodic assessments, and management support to key program activities including requirement determinations, joint concepts, integrated architectures, analysis of alternatives, cost estimating,  performance measures, program structures, program/project baselines, test planning, interoperability planning, and technical management.
5.	Support program life cycle standards tailoring, “milestone” evaluations and a “lessons learned” repository.
6.	Apply Knowledge Management (KM) tools and disciplines (consistent with the Agency’s KM agenda, Knowledge for Development) to the management of USAID IT programs.
7.	Develop high quality business cases (Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 300’s) that meet the following criteria: supports a passing score; requires minimal rework based on the PassBack Language; bypasses the OMB Watch List; provides management utility during the project life cycle; and serves as a baseline reporting mechanism for CPIC.
8.	Develop E-Government Migration/Implementation Plans that meet all PMO standards and guidelines and meet all validation requirements prior to submission to the Portfolio Manager.
9.	Provide hands-on analytical risk management services that includes assessing and analyzing risks within projects, across projects (identification of interdependencies and related risks), and throughout the USAID IT investment program.  Risk management services must  meet current IT life cycle and project management discipline best practice standards in the areas of risk management, risk aversion, project interdependency management, systems engineering management, software management, test and evaluation management and independent verification and validation.  
10.	Advise and apply communications and change management best practices into all PMO projects.
11.	Provide support for the additions/upgrades, configuration and maintenance of the PMO Tool Registry.

b.	Provide portfolio management services within an integrated program of IT initiatives in order to advance the Agency in meeting its Business Transformation Vision.

c.	Provide Business Analysis Support for Enterprise Architecture and Business Enterprise Planning that conforms to DOS/USAID Enterprise Architecture standards within the Office of Management and Budget Standard Architecture Format (Performance Reference Model, Business Reference Model, Data and Information Reference Model, Service Component Reference Model and Technical Reference Model) and all governing documents associated with the DOS/USAID infrastructure, as applicable.

d.	Support the movement of the Enterprise Architecture along a maturity model spectrum, enhancement of the governance structure that assures all IT projects are aligned to the Business Transformation vision, formalization process for vetting proposed projects against the Enterprise Architecture Reference Model and the conduct of business analysis during the implementation process.

e.	Provide support to the Joint Management Council (JMC), the joint DoS and USAID executive level governing body overseeing the business systems modernization process, and other USAID/DOS Collaboration activities.  Support would include tasks such as strategic and visionary thinking, gathering information, providing input into various project activities, developing agendas, attending meetings, writing meeting minutes, preparing and presenting information, and supporting other undefined tasks.  

f.	Conduct the operation of the USAID PMO in a way that complies with all applicable federal laws, regulations, guidance and best business practices.

g.	Conduct the operation of the USAID PMO in a way that complies with all directed changes as a result of the USAID, DOS, and Foreign Affairs Community collaborative effort.

h.	Conduct PMO operations in a way that supports the Project Management Institute (PMI) Project Management Body of Knowledge training model used by USAID to train its PM workforce.

i.	Conduct customer satisfaction surveys, tracking methods, and status updates after each and every deliverable and score an “Exceeds Expectations” rating 75% or more based on the following scale (Exceeds Expectations, Meets Expectations, and Needs Improvement). (Note: “Needs Improvement” ratings are unacceptable.)

j.	Conduct the Customer Relationship Program in a way that provides Enhanced Services (beyond Basic and Support) to the PMO and moves the deliverables provided to the USAID PMO from customer satisfaction (Meets Expectations) to customer delight (Exceeds Expectations).
 
It is extremely important to USAID to select a contractor capable of providing a range of PMO services and support for business transformation initiatives to meet its responsibilities under Federal legislation and executive orders. As such, USAID needs a contractor that can provide technical support to the PMO and perform as an integrator for strategic execution of “thought leadership” within USAID. The contractor needs to be an implementer of performance measurement to ensure consistency in meeting USAID’s President’s Management Agenda (PMA), Capital Investment Fund (CIF), Capital Planning and Investment Controls, and Joint Management Council (JMC) scorecard goals and progress; a catalyst to mature the PMO organization; and a spearhead for developing and implementing project and technical management best practices, strategy, process improvement, customer focus, benchmarking, technology, and quality processes to achieve quality products. USAID also needs a contractor to engage directly in all projects of the portfolio and to understand and help manage the relationship between projects within a portfolio and between all portfolios within an USAID program.

The following information is provided to assess the size and scope of the project task order:

1.	The contractor support workforce needed is estimated to be between 7-10 support personnel.
2.	The dollar value of the task order most likely will be between 500 thousand and 2.5 million per year. However, USAID will not establish any guaranteed dollar value for the newly established Blanket Purchase Agreement.
3.	The selected PMO support contractor will, as a minimum, supplement the PMO and its current contractor workforce. IBM Business Consulting Services is the existing PMO support contractor.
4.	Contractors providing services to the PMO will not be eligible to provide services under USAID’s Principal Resource for Information Management Enterprise-wide (PRIME) 2.2.
5.	Contractors providing services under the existing USAID Principal Resource for Information Management Enterprise-wide (PRIME) 2.2 task order and the Management Systems Technology Reform enterprise-wide Services (MSTR-e) Blanket Purchase Agreement are precluded from participation.
6.	The scope of the effort will focus initially on the following projects:
a.	Business Systems Modernization
i.	Phoenix Overseas Deployment (POD) – Upgrade of the current core accounting system and deployment of same to overseas missions and regional offices;
ii.	Joint Financial Management System (JFMS) – Implement project management standards support to JFMS and identify interdependencies with other projects and steady state resources.
iii.	Procurement Systems Improvement Project (PSIP) – Implementation of a new procurement system and deployment of same to USAID/W, overseas missions and regional offices;
iv.	JAAMS – Operations and maintenance of a joint USAID and DoS acquisition system beginning in FY06;
v.	Enterprise Architecture (EA)

b.	E-Government Projects (illustrative only)
i.	E-Grants
ii.	E-Travel
iii.	E-Clearance
iv.	E-Recruitment
v.	E-Authentication

c.	Applets

Interested sources should provide a capabilities package not longer than 15 pages (all inclusive with the exception of the title page and table of contents) demonstrating their ability to provide proven methodologies and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for various PMO activities.  Provide past performance references for other government PMO support tasks and explain the scope of services provided.  Provide a brief overview of the corporation’s program, portfolio and project management best practices.  Based on the capabilities statements, USAID will make an assessment of each offeror’s capabilities to successfully accomplish the services required by the Agency. Offerors that are bested suited for the USAID Program Management environment may be invited to compete for award of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for the PMO work under the Management, Organization and Business Improvement Services (MOBIS) Schedule (GSA Schedule 874). No other GSA Schedule types will be considered.

Individual task orders awarded under a MOBIS BPA may be designated as a classified task order in accordance with the USAID ADS Chapter 567, “Classified Contract Security and Contractor Personnel Security Program”, and FAR Subpart 4.4, “Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry.” As such, the contractor is subject to the requirements of these regulations and the security classifications specifications contained in the DD Form 254.

<DESC>The US Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Acquisition Center-Washington (CAC-W) on behalf of the Program Manager, Close Combat Systems, Countermine Division  is soliciting informational white papers for procurement of two hundred (200) M edium Mine Protected Vehicles (MMPV) used in point, route and area clearance of mines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IED).  The vehicles are used primarily to safely transport Soldiers and equipment while in deliberate search of hazardous explosive mate rials and supervise those operations that render the hazards safe.  The proposed solution is intended for use in current and future Engineer and Explosive Ordinance Disposal (EOD) force structures for point, route, and area clearance operations.  This Requ est for Information (RFI) is issued to assess the current production schedule and cost for non-developmental items that satisfy the Government requirements.  This is not a developmental effort.  The objective of this request is to survey potential non-deve lopmental vehicle solutions that provide protection and survivability to the Soldiers while conducting deliberate search of hazardous explosive materials and supervise those operations that render the hazards safe.  Information should include, but is not l imited to: availability or production schedule; cost; mine blast protection under wheels and centerline; ballistic protection from direct and indirect fire; nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protection; weapons; crew size; curb weight; payload; range;  length; width; height; ground clearance; air conditioning; speed; vertical step; fording depth; engine model; engine horsepower; engine torque; tire type; design considerations that lead to quick repair after a mine/IED strike.  The medium mine protected vehicle shall be transportable by a C-130 aircraft.  The MMPV shall be capable of transporting 8-10 Soldiers and can be modified to carry 4-6 Soldiers and an EOD robot.  The MMPV shall be capable of operating both on-road and off-road and in all types of w eather conditions and terrain.  The proposed MMPV shall be capable of withstanding a mine blast of 15 pounds along the centerline without injuring the crew.  The MMPV shall be capable of withstanding a mine blast of 15 pounds under any wheel without injuri ng the crew.  The MMPV shall be designed to be repairable after a mine blast.  The MMPV shall provide ballistic protection against 7.62 mm ball ammunition.  It is desired that the MMPV provide ballistic protection against 7.62 mm armor piercing (AP) ammuni tion.  The MMPV shall be upgradeable to provide NBC protection.  The white paper shall be no longer than 5 pages and shall include production schedule capabilities and a rough order magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for 200 vehicles.  Separate ROM cost estimat es shall be submitted for ballistic protection from 7.62 mm ball ammunition and for 7.62 mm AP ammunition.

These statistics can be used to tune the bugger pools by allowing the assignment of similar objects to the same buffer pool. SSA uses this software to enhance performance of the subsystem and the corresponding applications. Other organizations that believe they are capable of meeting SSA’s requirements are invited to submit information concerning their capabilities, experience, and other pertinent data. Pricing data may be submitted. This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the information received. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be used in SSA's assessment of capable sources. Verbal responses are not acceptable and will not be considered. Responses to this notice must be submitted by 09/10/03. Responses can be sent via email to Angie Landis at Angie.Landis@ssa.gov.

<SUBJECT>--USMC LAV-C2 UPGRADE INDUSTRY DAY - SEPTEMBER 22, 2004 - ALBANY, GA
<DESC>LAV-C2 UPGRADE INDUSTRY DAY - SEPTEMBER 22, 2004 - ALBANY, GA. The United States Marine Corps Light Armored Vehicle, Command and Control (LAV-C2) is a tactical vehicle that provides the necessary voice and data connectivity to intelligence, fire support, and maneuver elements in support of the Light Armored Reconnaiss ance (LAR) battalion or independent LAR company units during amphibious operations and subsequent operations ashore.  The LAV-C2 Upgrade Program will address the modernization of the communications suite in order to provide digital and voice traffic.  It w ill result in an open communications network architecture using legacy equipment while allowing for the drop-in of advanced, affordable communications technologies as they are matured and fielded (e.g., the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) to be fielded in FY09).  The LAV-C2 acquisition strategy will focus on integrating non-developmental sub-systems.  The candidate sub-systems have either been tested and fielded or are under development and will meet the required technology readiness level in order to mi nimize program risk.  Open architecture will allow seamless integration of next generation sub-systems.  The intercom, radio suite, server, and workstation upgrades to be included in the LAV-C2 upgrade program have been selected utilizing user surveys, Qua lity Functional Deployment (QFD), Pugh concept selection process, and trade studies.  A full and open competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) will specify that the selected upgrades are to be integrated into the prototype vehicles.  An industry day sponsore d by the Program Managers Office, Light Armored Vehicle (PM-LAV) will be held at the Crossroads Restaurant, Building 7450 on Radford Blvd, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, Georgia.  The industry day will commence at 0900 on 22 September 2004.  This in dustry day is designed to provide defense vehicle integrators with an opportunity to become familiar with the LAV-C2A1 vehicle and the C2 upgrade program.  Participants will have an opportunity to inspect and measure an existing LAV-C2A1 vehicle.  Addition al information on the C2 Upgrade Program and Industry Day can be found on theLAV-C2 Upgrade Program webpage at http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/majorsys/C2/C2.htm.

Replacement parts: The contractor shall use only new original equipment manufacturer or factory refurbished replacement parts in the performance of this contract.  If required replacement parts are not immediately available to the contractor while performing scheduled or unscheduled service calls, the contractor shall notify the Biomedical Equipment Maintenance Department of the deficiency and deliver to the hospital all replacement parts required to complete the inspection in order to maintain the 95% uptime.  The contractor shall not remove any item of USAF owned equipment from 55th Medical Group for service at the contractor’s establishment without the written consent of the Biomedical Equipment Maintenance Department.

Claims of Government Misuse or Abuse: If the contractor claims any service calls are the result of government abuse or misuse, the damage must immediately be shown to and verified by the Supt/NCOIC, Biomedical Equipment Maintenance before repairs are made. The Contracting Officer will resolve disagreement as to responsibility.  11.  Penalties:  11.1.  Contract payments for each of the option years will consist of 1/12 of the yearly cost invoiced at the end of each month.  11.2.  Failure to meet the reliability standards of 95% uptime during any month will result in a corresponding percentage reduction in that month’s payment calculated as follows:  Am = minimum number available hours/month allowed, Aa = actual hours available, At = total number hours per month system should be available, Ec = monthly cost, Am = At - .05 (At), % penalty = (1- Aa) x 100%, Amount to be withheld = (Ec) x (% penalty).  11.3.  Failure to meet the 95% uptime requirements for any three consecutive months, or failure to maintain an uptime percentage of 80% for one month, will constitute grounds for the government to contract with a third party to replace/repair all or part of the work at the original contractor’s expense.  If the government does contract with a third party, previous penalties will still stand.  The monthly payment will be withheld until the problem is resolved to the government’s satisfaction.  12.  Reliability:  All equipment must maintain a monthly percentage uptime of 95%, based upon the total number of hours in the month.  12.1.

S. COAST GUARD HU-25 AUXILIARY POWER UNIT REPAIR, STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES

1.0	BACKGROUND:

The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault Aviation, previously, Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate in salt laden environments.   The Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) model GTCP36-100C is a gas turbine engine, which is essentially a self-contained power source providing pneumatic and rotational shaft power.   The APU provides AC/DC electrical power for the HU-25 aircraft systems prior to engine start or during selected emergency procedures.  It also provides a pneumatic source for the operation of environmental systems during ground operations.  APU’s and their subcomponents are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking provides a historical record of repair, overhaul, maintenance, and item location and status.  It also provides an effective method of configuration control.  History has shown the APU to be highly reliable, with the exception of internal oil seals leaking oil in to the gas path.  Otherwise, little more is required than scheduled maintenance and inspections.  The APU requires Major Periodic Inspection (MPI) following: 2700 airframe operating hours, Foreign Object Damage (FOD), internal oil leaks, or mechanical failure beyond the scope of normal line maintenance.





2.0	OBJECTIVE:

THE COAST GUARD RESERVES THE RIGHT TO PERFORM A SITE SURVEY OF THE CONTRACTOR’S AND SUB-CONTRACTOR’S CAPABILITIES.

The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations (HSAR), Provisions and Clauses apply:  

52.212-1	Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items (Jan 2004)
 
52.212-2	Evaluation – Commercial Items (Jan 1999)

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance.  The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose quote is identified as offering the best value solution.

·	         The Source Selection Team (SST) may determine the best value for the Coast Guard
               merits a higher price based on technical superiority.  The SST, using sound business 
               judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal’s 
               relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors:

		     Factor 1 – Technical/Management Solution/Approach
                       Factor 2 – Performance Measures and Metrics
                       Factor 3 – Past Performance
                       Factor 4 – Cost/Price

	         Factors 1 and 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3.  While
               the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/Price 
               Factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor.

               Cost/Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical
               factors approach equal.

               Enclosure: (1) Detailed Factors




Enclosure (1)
DETAILED FACTORS

Factor 1:  Technical Management/Solution/Approach

Evidence of the quality of the technical management/solution/approach includes:

(a)	A comprehensive performance work statement and contract breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.

(b)	A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.

(c)	A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes.  The management approach needs to provide:

§	Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing large enterprise-wide managed services under performance based arrangements.
§	Clear lines of communication between the Contractor’s team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.
§	Active and continuing participation and involvement of senior corporate executives in ensuring the success of this program.

(d)	The Offeror’s validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance, e.g., ISO 9000 type or other quality certifications, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) required service bulletins, FAA 8130-3 Flight Worthiness document.

Factor 2:  Performance Measures and Metrics

The offered performance metrics and service level agreements will be evaluated for the extent they are:

(a)	Comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track, and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives,
(b)	Identifying the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness,
(c)	Tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.


Factor 3:  Past Performance

The past performance evaluation will examine how the Offeror’s past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction.  The Coast Guard may use data obtained from other sources to conduct the past performance assessment, as well as that provided in the proposal.

The past performance evaluation will also examine the Offeror’s actual performance on repair of similar or like items.  This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.

Factor 4:  Cost/Price

Each Contractor’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated based on the following:

(a)	Evaluation or proposed price/cost.  Offeror’s quote shall include a firm-fixed-price for each of the one-year ordering periods contained in the 3-year base and the 2-year option.  

(b)	Reasonableness:  Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.

(c)	Realism:  A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the Contractor’s proposed cost/price proposal.  The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Contractor’s technical proposal.  The price proposal should include sufficient detail to allow for complete evaluation, e.g. work breakdown, structure, material description, prices, labor categories, rates and hours.

Statement of work


HH60J Alignment Fixture Decking Requirements

USCG, Aircraft Repair & Supply Center, Elizabeth City, NC, is requesting offers for the fabrication and installation of aluminum decking to cover and surround an existing HH60 Helicopter alignment fixture located in Hangar 79.  The fixture was constructed by ADC Engineering in 2003.  Specific requirements are as follows:

Purpose:  To permit airframe and sheet metal mechanics to work airframe discrepancies on the lower portion of HH60 helicopters while the aircraft is rigged in the alignment fixture.

General Specifications:
1)	Decking must be of sufficient strength to accommodate a 1,500 pound live load capacity with no deflection of working surface.
2)	Equipped with evenly spaced stair treads to allow easy transition from the hangar floor to the stands working surfaces.
3)	No alteration of the fixture’s alignment targets will be permitted.

WARNING:  This Statement of Work is for general guidance only.  Potential offerors are STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to make a site visit to the hangar/fixture site.

Item #1, Alignment Base Decking:  Decking must cover forward area of alignment fixture with overall dimensions of approximately 92.5 inches in width by 216 inches in length.  Removable decking must cover base of alignment fixture, inboard of main landing gear tracks at a width of 92.25 inches.  Length of decking is expected to be relatively short in relation to width, so as to allow the weight of each piece of decking to not exceed 80 pounds, thus allowing reasonably easy removal by two persons of average strength, yet minimize the total number of pieces needed to cover the approximate 216-inch length of the fixtures base.  Decking height must sit at a level where the decks bottom surface is flush with top lip of main landing gear track rails (approximately 16.5 inches above the hangar floor).  Upper surface of decking must be of a sufficient smoothness and stiffness to permit the use of mechanics “creepers” and able to support three mechanics with minimal deflection of the deck surface.  Decking must be fabricated to clear 2 contour support structures, one tail landing gear hydraulic jack, and various supporting structures between main landing gear tire tracks.

WARNING:  This Statement of Work is for general guidance only.  Potential offerors are STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to make a site visit to the hangar/fixture site.

Item #2, Work Stand Lower Decking (One Right Hand, One Left Hand):  Decking is to be attached to two existing movable work stands used for maintenance on both the right and left hand side top of the aircraft.  The work stands lower decking is to be installed at a height where the bottom surface of  decking is flush with the top edge of the alignment fixtures main landing gear tracks vertical flanges (approximately 16.5 inches above the hangar floor.  Decking shall cover the entire area directly below the existing work stands upper work area (dimensions are approximately 250 by 71 inches).

A one-tread staircase is to be equipped on each of the decks (1 right and 1 left) to allow easy transition from floor level to the decks top surface.  Location of the staircase is along the outboard 250 inch dimension.
A strip of hinged decking is needed along the inboard edge of the work stands lower decking along the 250 inch dimension and should extend the lower decking work area surface an additional 18.5 inches in an inboard direction to provide a flush and continuous deck from the outboard edge of the R/H work stand to the outboard edge of the L/H work stand, when base decking is in place and a hinged decking is in a down position.  The hinged deck must extend in an inboard direction approximately 18.5 inches to cover the main landing gear wheel tracks.  The 18.5 inch wide decking that covers  the main landing gear wheel tracks shall be hinged to the work stands fixed decking or work stands vertical support columns and able to rotate 90 degrees upwards to expose the alignment fixtures tire tracks, thus allowing movement in and out of the alignment fixture.  A mechanical catch will be required to keep hinged decking up and clear from main landing gear tire tracks.  In a downward/work position, hinged decking may rest on upper edge of the main landing gear tire tracks vertical flange.

WARNING:  This Statement of Work is for general guidance only.  Potential offerors are STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to make a site visit to the hangar/fixture site.

The decking will be used in support of US Coast Guard owned HH60J Aircraft.  The closing date and time for receipt of offers is September 08, 2004, 4:00 pm EDT.  Facsimile and email quotes are acceptable and may be faxed to 252.335.6790 or emailed to tburgess@arsc.uscg.mil. For information regarding this solicitation, contact Tracey Burgess at 252.335.6091.

<CONTACT>Kathleen M. Colson Contracting Officer 2083875545 kathy_colson@nifc.blm.gov;
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Firm, fixed-price offers are requested under Request for Quotations (RFQ) solicitation #RAQ044010.  This document incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-24.  This solicitation is set-aside 100% for small business.  The NAICS code is 339999.  The business size standard is 500 employees.     STATEMENT OF WORK - The Bureau of Land Management has a requirement to purchase a Gelled Fuel Batch Mixer mounted on a service trailer to be used in the support of prescribed and wildland fire suppression activities in the 10 western states.  The batch mixer and trailer shall be designed for severe off highway use and constructed to handle the rough unimproved road conditions found throughout the western states.  The contractor shall provide a unit that meets or exceeds all requirements of NFPA 385 and DOT MC406 and shall provide any additional technical and structural engineering required for a fuel service trailer that is operated in conditions where road and environment place stresses much greater than those found on primary and secondary roads.         BACKGROUND - The Departments of Interior and Agriculture as well as numerous other State and Federal agencies use a variety of gelled fuel batch mixers, modular mix transfer systems, helitorches and terratorches to start prescribed fires and to fight wild fires.    The batch mixer consists of a transport trailer and a DOT 406 Specification tank in which gasoline and a thickening agent is mixed.  The thickening agent is introduced to the gasoline through a dome lid on the tank.  Mixing occurs when the gasoline and thickening agent are circulated together in the tank using a pump and hose manifold located on the trailer, to which the tank is mounted.  The same pump is used to transfer the gelled gasoline into helitorches.  The same equipment is also used when the equipment is used with a terratorch.  Power for the mixing, transfer to a helitorch or to a terratorch is currently provided by an internal combustion gasoline engine attached to a positive displacement pump and piping manifold with valves for direction and function.  The associated electrical switches and controls are rated for Class 1, Division 1 or Division 2 as recommended in NFPA 497.     The operation involves the filling of the tank through the fill port with gasoline from a gasoline delivery truck.  After the gasoline is introduced, a funnel is then connected to the gasoline fill cam lock and the gelling agent is poured into the tank.  The mixing is accomplished with the engine and pump circulating the gasoline and gelling agent.  After mixing the gelled fuel is allowed to sit for several minutes, the exact amount of time is dependent on the mix ratio and the outside air temperature.  It is then pumped into the helitorch or terratorch by means of the same engine, pump and a delivery hose.         DESIGN - Unit shall be a 400 Gallon, in-field use gelled fuel batch mixer and service trailer.  Unit shall meet or exceed requirements of NFPA 385 and DOT MC406.

(2)	UV A only 
(3)	UV B only 
(4)	UV A + UV B

(10) Digital Exposure Controller: Closed loop system shall maintain the output and stability of the Xenon lamp at a constant level as it ages.  This allows for consistent output of the wavelengths of interests.  Must control to within ± 1 %. (Note: This is in addition to the power supply that regulates the Xenon Arc Lamp.) 

CLIN 00002: INSTALLATION AND ACCEPTANCE TESTING REQUIREMENTS FOR CLIN 0001:

The Contractor must perform acceptance testing after the system is delivered to NIST.  This acceptance testing shall occur within seven (7) days after the system is received by NIST Shipping and Receiving.

 [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

(a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>MODIFIED--26 AUG 04--The following Questions and Answers are hereby incorporated into the combined synopsis/solicitation referenced above:

37.  Do you have a sample report or at least column headers for the reports desired? No, the vendor should  propose this.

38.  Is there an incumbent? Who? and will be the successful bidder receive that incumbent's history and logs? No, there is not an incumbent for this exact effort.

39.  Will there be a statement of work (SOW) issued? The SOW is in the solicitation.

40.  Will you provide a list of wholly owned EBAY sites? No, Ebay will provide if they so choose to work with the vendor.

41.  Will the batch email be electronic, snail mail or a combination? It can be a combination.

44. The documentation in FBO describes two methods by which a vendor can deliver a proposal. But it also makes note of proposals sent by conventional US Mail are not routed to the above mentioned address. Are we to assume that using another carrier besides US Mail will allow the proposal to be delivered appropriately?  Proposal submissions may be hand carried, mailed or express mailed to Commanding General, MARCORSYSCOM, A/C Contracts-LYF, 2200 Lester St, Quantico, VA 22134.  They may also be emailed to the Contracting Officer at frazierly@mcsc.usmc.mil.  Emails cannot exceed 5MB because of firewall limitations unless divided into multiple emails.  Note that the deadline for submission is 1400 (2PM) and emails should be sent accordingly to ensure a timely submission.
 
45.  Can you describe the "services" as referenced being required 24x7x365? Does this speak to available contractors physically performing some or all of the required monitoring/analysis on eBay and Customer Support Services, or simply the portal by which information will be accessed? This is in reference to portal and information available to the Marine Corps to control the illegal proliferation of organizational property.
 
46. In addition to eBay and 250 search engines, are there other auction sites that should be considered when attempting to establish Exclusive API agreements? Or, can these be monitored/analyzed via web based interface? That is for the offeror to determine and submit in their proposal.
 
47. Regarding Inspection/Acceptance "at destination", what criteria is the USMC looking for to pass site inspection and if teamed, does the worked performed "at destination" have to be performed at the Prime's location, or can it be performed at the Sub's location?  This means that the USMC customer should be able to access the portal and obtain the information requested in this solicitation 24X7X365.

48.  I would like to know if there is an incumbent contract on the Internet Monitoring Service, SOL #M6785404R3101. If so, could you please provide the following information: contract number, contractor name, award date, expiration date, award duration, contract type, and total value.  No, there is not an incumbent contractor for this exact effort.
 
49.  Can you release the name of the organization or software that was used for the pilot project you reference? No. 

50. Are you already working with a preferred vendor on this?  Is this a new contract or a renewal?  Just trying to assess our chances at this point. See answers to questions 48 & 49.

51. We have access to software that allows us to monitor eBay.  What is an "Exclusive Application Programming Interface agreement"?  This would be an agreement between the offeror and Ebay to exchange information that would be beneficial to the requirements in this solicitation. 

52. What is the purpose of having the ability to search a minimum of 250 search engines?  This is what the Marine Corps has established as sufficient. 

53. Is the "USMC unique storage cache" a storage cache used exclusively for USMC, or is it something else?  It is exclusively for the Marine Corps.

54.  Does "execute subscription within 45 days" mean that this system has to be fully operational within 45 days (including the ability to search a minimum of 250 search engines)?  Yes, fully operational in 45 days.

<DESC>This is Amendment 0001 to RFQ SB1341-04-Q-0901 to address questions as follows:

1.  What is the maximum power?  3 kW or is this more than is needed?

A very dynamic system with power range from 5W to 3kW. 
Note spec 2.  Load bank must be able to control either potential or current in single cell and multi-cell PEM stacks from 100mV to 5V and 5A to 600A. 

2.  For item 6, the MFC requirement states 0.07% full scale repeatability.  Is this value correct?  

This value is correct.

3.  For item 3, is the value of 8 kHz for AC impedance, or DC resistance, and is this high a frequency necessary?  

This frequency will be ultimately used for a DC resistance, so phase and sweeping are not important.  The Government’s specification is for 8 kHz.

4.  In item 4, it states that an optional Reformate Simulator that internally mixes the reformate gases specified in the control system.  In item 6, it states a pre-mixed reformate gas.  If mixing is necessary, how many gasses, and which gases will be used, as a separate MFC will need to be used for each type of gas (MFC s are calibrated based on type of gas)?  If premixed, what is the mixed gases composition?

Note that this specification is that the Government would like to have the option of buying a reformate simulator for this system.  It does not mean that the system must contain a reformate simulator but the system shall have a simulator available to be added on at a later date or purchased at time of award with the system. The reformate simulator should be capable of mixing at least three-gases ( H2, CO2, and N2). 

Please price separately the optional reformate simulator.

5.  What are the exact power ratings of the fuel cells and stacks to be tested?

Power range from 5W to 3kW. 

6.  Regarding the dimension restrictions in paragraph 16, are the limits a doorway constraint?  

These dimensional constraints are based on room size and crane clearance, and they do not include an enclosure for the fuel cell test section.  If your footprint includes a platform or enclosure please subtract that area from the overall footprint.  If the overall size exceeds the specified 3x6x6 foot envelope by more than 10 inches in any dimension it will probably not fit.

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a)  This acquisition will utilize the Technically Acceptable-Performance/Price Tradeoff (TA-PPT) source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision.  A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror’s proposal will be made.  For those offerors who are determined to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past performance and price, with past performance being considered equal to price.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the tradeoff process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the selection process.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those included in paragraph (b)(1) below.
            
(b)   The TA-PPT evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:

     (1)  Technical.   Each offeror’s technical proposal will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach to meeting the government’s minimum requirements as described in the Schedule of Supplies.  Offeror’s proposals meeting the government’s minimum requirements will determined to be technically “acceptable”.
 
(2)  Performance.  For technically acceptable proposals, the past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet users’ needs including cost and schedule.  The currency and relevancy of the information, the source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered.  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The Government may consider an offeror’s contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

•	VERY RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this solicitation requires. 
•	RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. 
•	SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. 
•	NOT RELEVANT:  Did not involve any significant aspects of above.

In assessing present and past performance, the Government will employ several approaches, including, but not limited to:

(i).  Information utilized may be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, as well as from other sources known to the Government.  Data from previous source selections may be used if the data is recent and relevant.  Evaluation of present and past performance will include consideration of overall customer satisfaction and conclusions of informed judgment.  

	(ii).  Offerors may be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to  respond to the information.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence assessment will consider issues including, but not limited to, the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.

	(iii).  Past performance information will also be considered regarding any critical subcontractors and key personnel.  If an offeror, or the proposed key employees of the offeror, do not have a past performance history deemed relevant to this solicitation, the offeror will receive a neutral confidence rating.  The neutral confidence rating will be considered in the overall assessment for a best value decision.

	(iv) An overall confidence assessment rating will be made.  The following confidence assessment ratings apply:

Rating				Definition

Blue  			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
exceptional/high confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Green 		Based on the offerors record of performance there is very
good/significant confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Yellow		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
satisfactory/confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Grey			Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
neutral/unknown confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Black		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is
marginal/little confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Red			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
unsatisfactory/no confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

(3)  Price.  

 	    (a) IAW FAR Part 15.305 (a)(1) Cost or Price Evaluation, this competitive procurement will establish the basis for price reasonableness.
	
              (b) Total evaluated price, for award purposes, will be based upon the total price proposed.
