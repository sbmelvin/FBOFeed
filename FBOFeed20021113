<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the annual renewal software maintenance for the Galaxie system in support of the Scientific and Technical Information Library Automation System STILAS and one option year of maintenance. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from	SIRSI Corporation as the only known source that can meet agency requirements.  Since SIRSI authored the STILAS software that is used for the Galaxie system, they are the only source that can troubleshoot, upgrade, and revise their product. The STILAS software has been in use at Langley Research Center for the past six years.  Recompetition would become significantly more expensive and costs could not be recovered through any competition.	 The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 22, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The National Council on Disability (NCD) is interested in evaluating the design, production, marketing and sale of a number of technology products to determine whether the most commonly stated obstacles to technology accessibility (such as cost, difficulty and/or timing of built-in accessibility features) are supported by research. This study should look at a range of technology products and with respect to each product, examine cost effectiveness; consumer input at the design stage; the development process; customer use and perceptions; idiosyncratic and standardized industry protocols; and current business and industry practices related to universal design, as well as barriers to implementation. This study should examine the philosophical, economic, industry, and technological rationales that currently drive the development of universal design and document examples of successful and nonsuccessful practices. The evaluation will rely primarily on qualitative research strategies, although some quantitative research approaches may be relied upon for economic analysis involving cost data. The estimated contract period is 10 months. NCD will distribute its Universal Design Request for Proposals (RFP) to interested parties on December 18, 2002. NCD will expect interested parties to submit their responses by February 1, 2003. Copies of the RFP may be requested by mail or picked up at NCD on or after the issue date of December 18, 2002. All requests must reference the RFP number and title.

<DESC>NA The Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) Office is interested in receiving proposals for research focusing on the areas of Cleanup, Compliance, Conservation, Pollution Prevention, and Unexploded Ordna nce technologies. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). Proposers should state in their proposal that it is submitted in response to this BAA. Readers should note that this is an announcement to decla re DoD/SERDPs intent to competitively fund research and development for innovative and new environmental technologies that meet the focus areas set forth in the SERDP Program Announcement. The Program Announcement can be found on the DoD/SERDP Home Page a ccessible through the World Wide Web at http://www.serdp.org/funding/nonfed. No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. Awards may take the form of contracts, grants or cooperative agreements. Subm ission of proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity. Before preparing a proposal, potential proposers should read the information provided in the SERDP Program Announcement for details regarding proposal submission, the evaluation of proposals, and the individual Statements of Need (SON). Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process. The government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals nor travel to present oral present ations in support of the proposals. To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a preproposal white paper, including a signed original copy, plus six (6) additional copies to: Ms. Brenda Batch, SERDP Progra m Office, 901 North Stuart Street, Suite 303, Arlington, VA 22203-1821, 703-696-2127.  Preproposal white papers sent via fax or electronic mail will be rejected. White papers must be received no later than 4:00 PM EST on Thursday, January 9, 2003. They mus t be in abstract form describing the merits and objectives of the proposers project. The abstract should concisely describe what the proposer has to offer the SERDP Program and discuss (1) the proposed objective(s) and approach with a clear identification  of overall innovation and scientific/ technical merits; (2) the proposers capabilities and related experience, or unique combination of these which are integral factors in achieving a proposed objective; and (3) the qualifications and experience of the p rincipal investigator, team leader, or key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the proposal. Preproposal white papers should be no longer than five pages (not including the cover page), single sided, and 11 point. One attachment of up  to three single sided pages of test data may also be submitted. The cover page must be completed and entered via the website at www.serdp.org/proposalcover/ in the format specified in the Instructions.  At a minimum, the preproposal white papers should co ntain: (1) a title, descriptive of the research to be performed; (2) the name and address of the individual, company or educational institution submitting the white paper; (3) the abstract of the technical objective and description of the approach includin g how the approach described satisfies the focused need in the SON; (4) the duration of the project along with a milestone chart with significant events; (5) the estimated labor cost, materials cost, burdens, and profit (if any) by year; and (6) a one page  curriculum vitae of the Principal Investigator (not included in the five page preproposal count). Based upon the preproposal white paper evaluation by the Government, a submitter may be contacted for further information and may be encouraged to submit a f ull proposal by a set time and date. The format requirements for the full proposal are set forth in the Program Announcement on the DOD SERDP Home Page. Each of  the white paper submitters will be notified as to whether the Government encourages or does not encourage the submission of a full proposal. The white paper review step allows interested organizations to get initial Government feedback on their technologi es without the expense of a full proposal. A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award for that work. Multiple awards may be made to address a particular SON. It is expected that awards totaling a pproximately $2.0 million will result. White papers and full proposals will be evaluated against the following factors, listed in descending order of importance: (1) SERDP relevance (PASS/FAIL) - whether the submission responds to high-priority, mission re levant, DoD and DOE environmental requirements as described in the SON; (2) the approach, objective(s) and overall scientific and technical merits of the proposed technology; (3) potential for transition of the proposed research; (4) the qualifications, ca pabilities, and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader, or key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposed objectives; (5) realism of the proposed cost, and availability of funds; and (6) availability of other financial sup port for the proposed effort. For awards to be made as contracts, evaluation shall include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, woman owned small business concerns, histor ically black colleges and universities, and minority institutions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAISC) code is 541710 (previously standard industrial classification code 8731) with the small business size standard of 500 employees. In  addition, contract proposals that exceed $500,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. The point of contact for this BAA for technical issues is Ms. Brenda Batch, SERDP Program Office, 703-696-2127 and for non-technical issues is Mr. James F. Bowers, HECSA, 703-428-7406.

<DESC>NA TACOM plans to negotiate a firm fixed price contract for modifications to four (4) Tactical Firefighting Trucks (TFFT) to bring them into conformity with the current configuration.  The four TFFT were purchased from Pierce Manufacturing, Inc., under a Defe nse Logistics Agency Schedule.  The TFFT is built on a Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) chassis.  Due to changes in requirements, modifications to the four existing TFFT are necessary.  Required actions include: (a) Replace the engine in the TFFT with the new electronic engine and torque converter to maintain commonality with future TFFT and other new HEMTT vehicles; (b) Perform upgrades to include pump and roll configuration; and (c) Test support for testing of those vehicles.  TACOM plans to  procure this effort on a non-competitive basis from Pierce a subsidiary of Oshkosh Truck Corporation (OTC) in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  See Note 22.  The solicitation will be released to the TACOM website on or about 2 Dec 02.  The offer due  date is on or around 17 Dec 02.  No hard copies of solicitation will be issued; you must download it from the TACOM Acq website: http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/opportunity.htm.

<DESC>NASA/ARC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a Nd:YAG dual-head laser for use in stereo particle image velocimetry (SPIV) studies.  This special purpose laser, capable of producing two short-duration pulses that are separated in time by a controllable amount in order to quantify the aerodynamic characteristics of the flow in the wake of rotor blades, is to be used at NASA Ames Research Center.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/ARC intends to purchase Gemini - PIV -200 Q-Switched, pulsed, Nd:YAG dual-head laser, from New Wave Research, 47613 Warm Springs Blvd., Fremont, CA 94539, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) based on its proven capabilities to design, deliver, and support Nd:YAG  dual-head lasers that are portable and easy to incorporate in experimental setups.  New Wave lasers of this type are already in use at ARC for PIV image acquisitions in situations where cooling water is not readily available and electrical power is limited to 115 volts AC.   It is critical that the laser purchased have the following specific characteristics:  1) dual head; 2) Q switched; 3) continuously variable pulse rates from 0 to 15 Hertz, using either internal or external (TTL) signals; 4) 200 mJ per pulse at 532 nm; 5) pulse width of 3 to 5 ns; 6) 1/60/115 power requirement; 7) remote control panel for each head, allowing control of energy from high to low for optics alignment; 8) laser heads weigh no more than 27 pounds total; 9) power supply weighs no more than 55 pounds; 10) each power supply must include an internal, closed-loop water-cooling system (with external fill) that operates on 1/60/115 power. Because of significant safety, training, and optical design issues, it is important that the requested laser matches, both functionally and architecturally, lasers of the same design that have already been purchased.  These lasers are often shared with other branches at ARC in order to generate multiple light sheets from two or more matched lasers.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 1:30 p.m. local time on December 2, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>Q -- CMS Nursing Home Chain Project
<SOLNBR>HLH-03
<RESPDATE>112202
<ARCHDATE>12072002
<CONTACT>Herman Harris, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-786-9104, Fax 410-786-9922, Email HHarris@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will select one Medicare Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) contractor to partner with several large (multi-State, multi-facility) nursing home organizations ("chains") to assist the chains in implementing quality improvement collaboratives for their member facilities.  This notice is posted to invite expressions of interest from qualifying chains to participate in this pilot project.  

This project will take place over a period of 18 months.  During this time, we anticipate each participating chain will organize approximately 4 "learning sessions" involving up to 50 project teams each.  Project teams represent the chain's individual facilities and will be expected to conduct improvement activities between learning sessions, with facilitated interaction between teams via teleconference, email, etc.  The QIO coordinating this project will serve as the principal link between the chain and the QIO program with respect to CMS's Nursing Home Quality Initiative.  The coordinating QIO will also provide each participating chain with materials and instruction necessary to implement collaborative quality improvement activities targeted at improving performance on one targeted quality measure within the chain's member facilities.  Any individual facility within the chain may also work with its State QIO on this, or other topics related to the nursing home quality measures CMS will publicly report in late 2002.  Chains will be responsible for costs of implementing quality improvement activities within their organizations and facilities.  Chains will also be responsible for any costs (such as travel, lodging, long-distance telephone charges) associated with their participating in learning opportunities and activities provided by the QIO in the course of this project. 

Based on research and discussions with nursing home industry representatives, QIOs, and other relevant stakeholders, the Quality Measure targeted for improvement under this limited-duration pilot project will be:  The Percentage of Residents with Pain. 

Due to limited funding available for the pilot project, participation in the study will be limited.  CMS will review the written expressions of interest we receive from organizations volunteering to participate in this project, and, based on the information each chain provides in its expression of interest, will select up to six chain organizations to participate in this pilot project.  After consultation with relevant stakeholders, we have developed minimum criteria to qualify for participation:
 
Minimum Criteria for Participation
1.	Chain organization must operate nursing facilities (certified by Medicare, Medicaid, or both) in at least 10 separate States (and/or U.S. Territories).
2.	Chain organization must at the time of volunteering to participate operate a minimum of 50 total nursing facilities (certified by Medicare, Medicaid, or both).
3.	Organization must provide evidence of an existing quality infrastructure and a statement of willingness to utilize resources within this infrastructure to work with this project's coordinating QIO. 

In the event more than six chains express interest in participating and document that they meet or exceed minimum selection criteria, CMS will prioritize volunteers for final selection as participants based on both the chains' specific characteristics in relation to minimum criteria and consideration of the additional characteristics described below.  

Additional Characteristics Considered in Selecting Participating Organizations
1.	Number of Medicare beneficiaries whose care would be potentially improved. 
2.	Wide geographic distribution of chain's member facilities preferred.
3.	Demonstrated motivation, resources, and ability to partner with QIOs to optimize Quality Improvement systems within nursing homes and chains.

Via this notice, CMS invites expressions of interest from qualifying chains.  A letter expressing interest is not a binding commitment to participate.  In response to stakeholder requests that we minimize unnecessary delays in implementing this project, the process for selecting the coordinating QIO and participating chains are proceeding simultaneously.  This will result in CMS selecting the coordinating QIO after we have chosen the participating chain organizations.  Those chains selected to participate will be informed of the QIO selected to coordinate this project when this information is known, and will also have an opportunity to review detailed materials about how this project will be conducted and its impact analyzed before being asked to fully commit to this project.

Letters of interest may be transmitted via paper mail, fax, or electronic mail, and should include the name, address, business phone, and email address for a point of contact for this project within the chain.  Letters of interest should not exceed three pages in length. 

Because CMS will select participants based on chain characteristics as documented in their expressions of interest, any chain organization responding to this notice should clearly and explicitly address the points listed below.

Points to Address in Letter of Interest: 
1.	How chain meets the minimum criteria for participation.
2.	Chain's characteristics in relation to additional characteristics considered in selecting chains.
3.	How the chain proposes to implement quality improvement under this project.
4.	How this project would fit into chain's existing quality infrastructure.

Any nursing home chain organization interested in participating should submit its non-binding letter of interest to CMS at the address below.  In order to be considered, letters of interest must reach CMS by 5:00 pm (Eastern Time) on 22 November 2002.  

Letters of interest, and any questions about this notice, should be directed to:

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) intends to procure selected spare parts managed by the DSCP, Defense Supply Center Columbus, and Defense Supply Center Richmond.  Under this effort, called the Strategic Material Sourcing/Rapid Manufacturing Initiative (SMS/RMI), parts will be arranged into various market baskets that group together similar items based on their shared attributes.  The federal supply groups across each DLA Inventory Control Point that may be included in the separate phases of the solicitation are 53, 39, 40, 42, 69, 41, 62, 93, and 95.  Market baskets will be comprised of a mixture of high and low demand items, and consider other industry attributes such as similar manufacturing processes and/or materials, and prospective competitive representation.  This initiative will be executed through multiple phases where each phase will consist of various market baskets. Specific information associated with each phase and its market baskets will be available at http://www.dscp.dla.mil/gi/ (and the link to SMS-RMI), upon issuance of the solicitation and future amendments. 

This Presolicitation Notice has been designated as a partial small business set-aside on the Fed Biz Ops for identification purposes only. This identification is to draw attention to both small and large business. Commensurate with shared attributes and competitive representation specific to each market basket, it is anticipated that respective market baskets will be identified as either a Hub Zone, 8A, Veteran Owned, Veteran Disabled, Woman Owned, Total set aside, Partial set aside or Unrestricted. Market baskets identified as unrestricted will be limited to those requirements where there is no reasonable expectation that at least two responsible small business offers will be received; as substantiated by prior experience, market research, and industry feedback. 

The resultant contract(s) terms will provide for indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity types with an anticipated eleven (11) year contract term, consisting of a 5-year base period and three (3) 2-year option periods.  All parts are fully competitive and will be provided in accordance with technical requirements provided by the Government.   All items to be furnished under the resultant contract(s) will be ordered by issuance of delivery orders.    
 
The market baskets for Phase 1 will be posted on http://www.dscp.dla.mil/gi/ on or about 18 NOVEMBER 2002.  Prospective offerors are requested to review and provide comments on the market baskets, considering suitability for small business participation and the offeror's capability to supply the full range of items in each basket. A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is also expected to be available on the website by 22 November 2002.  Comments will be submitted via a Question and Answer link on this web site. Answers to all questions will also be available via this website.  Comments for Phase 1 must be submitted to the DSCP point of contact no later than 09 DECEMBER 2002.  Technical data packages for Phase 1 may not be fully available until the issuance of the solicitation.  The anticipated solicitation issue date is 16 DECEMBER 2002.   Copies of the solicitation will be posted on the DLA Procurement Gateway at http://www.progate.daps.mil/home/. From the Gateway home page, select "Search RFP's" from the left hand sidebar.

CTR is an initiative intended to reduce operation and support costs and seeks to improve end item spares.  It is centered on performance- ba sed requirements and must be accomplished within the operating budget available for procurement of spares.  The Army does not provide funds for initial investigation or qualification of new designs under this program.  The concept for this program would al low companies to enter into non-contractual agreements which allow for information sharing and non-disclosure agreements with the Command to exchange technical and requirements information in order to identify candidates appropriate for CTR.  No funds are available to support a contractual vehicle for this program.  Companies would have the opportunity to recommend candidates for the program based on the information provided.  Companies must be willing to develop business case analysis for the item and fund  up-front investments required to develop/validate new designs with an understanding that AMCOM cannot guarantee selection of a candidate or procurement of the new item in the future, however, should the candidate be procured, the company will have the opp ortunity to recover their investment as long as the costs do not exceed the current spares' budget for that item.  The Business Case Analysis for an item will include the following: Total System Impact, Reliability Impact, Availability of the New Design, Obsolescence Avoidance, Repair/Maintenance Philosophy, Overall Cost Savings, Logistic Footprint Companies interested in this program must submit capability statements to include sustainment-engineering expertise directed in the areas of rotary wing aircraft and missile weapon systems and ground support equipment for those systems.  The statement shou ld include: Technical approach; Key personnel with resumes; Facilities, equipment, tooling available; Past performance history for similar work. Teaming arrangements are encouraged to support this concept.  Capability statements will be evaluated based upon the following criteria: Degree of understanding of the technical aspects of spares and repairables and related issues;  Demonstrated credibility of the proposed technical approach;  Soundness of technical approach and proposed plan to optimize spares cost, schedule and performance; Relevance and history of performing similar work; Availability of resources to successfully conduct the proposed work;Key personnel qualifications; Capability in performance based specification development;  Analytical and manufacturing capabilities associated with applicable spares development (including qualification and test);  Suitability to perform as a future spares developer and integrator. Responses should be directed to U. S. Army Aviation and Missile Command, ATTN:  AMSAM-AC-LS-L/Ms. C. Dickens, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898.  Questions may be directed to Ms. Dickens at 256-842-7598.

<DESC>Description

Request for both sources sought and comments on DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS), Areas Distribution Centers, for the A-76 Competitive Sourcing Study for distribution of order entry, inventory, logistics and warehouse management activities required to support distribution of published products (e.g., forms, publications, Braille products, and CD ROMs) to the public and within IRS.

Objective
The Internal Revenue Service has two objectives for submitting this notice.  The first objective is to obtain industry comments on the DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) for an A-76 Competitive Sourcing Study for distribution of forms and publications to both internal and external customers of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The Government is currently performing this work.  The Government will consider all information received when preparing a final PWS; however, any and all changes are at the sole discretion of the Government.  In addition to comments to the draft PWS, please address the following:

1.	Proposal preparation period.  Length of time you believe you will need to prepare a proposal to adequately address all requirements;
2.	Contract term (length).  Typically, a service contract has a one-year base period and 4 one-year option periods.  Provide the advantages and disadvantages for having more than 4 one-year option periods;  
3.	Appropriate performance incentives.  Provide possible performance incentives and the advantages and disadvantages of each suggested incentive.  NOTE:  Incentives included in the best value private-to-private competition must also be incorporated into the Government?s Most Efficient Organization (MEO?s) proposal in order to compare like proposals for a cost comparison and final selection; and, 
4.	Any additional information you need from the IRS that would assist you in pursuing this effort as a business opportunity.

Any information provided is voluntary.  As such, the Government will not cover any costs for any information or inquiry submitted as a result of this request.    Should the Government have questions regarding individual responses, the responder will be contacted for further information.

The DRAFT PWS is available at the following IRS internet site:  http://www.procurement.irs.treas.gov  (under Business Opportunities).  All comments regarding the PWS and associated documents should be e-mailed to AWSS.RFI.ADC@irs.gov.  Only electronic comments will be accepted.

The second objective is to obtain capability statements, based upon the requirements outlined in the DRAFT PWS, of all (large and small) businesses interested in this opportunity.  Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way or solicit offers from all responsible sources.   The acquisition under this A-76 study will be conducted under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 493110, General Warehousing and Storage, which establishes a small business size standard of $21.5M.  All interested businesses are hereby invited to submit a capability statement of no more than ten pages to demonstrate their ability to provide the services outlined in the DRAFT PWS. Capability statements should be tailored to this request and identify the source?s capabilities to complete this requirement, including information on key staff experience and a description of corporate experience with similar projects of like size and complexity.  In order for the IRS to assess set-aside possibilities, interested parties shall also include a cover letter that includes company name, points of contract, telephone numbers, fax numbers, e-mail addresses for points of contact, and identifies the company as one or more of the following: 1) small business; 2) 8(a) business; 3) HUBZone small business; 4) small disadvantaged business; 5) woman-owned small business; (6) veteran-owned small business; or, (7) service-disabled veteran-owned small business.

<CONTACT>FRANK HOLLEY, 309-782-2212
<DESC>NA The Mines, Demolition, Grenades AND 40MM office of the Operations Support Command (OSC) is conducting a market survey of industry to identify sources that are interested in manufacturing the Fluted Liner Ext for end item M430A1 HEDP Cartridge. The POC is: Frank Holley, US Army Operations Support Command, Industrial Specialist, (309)782-2212.  The technical description of the item is as follows:  Fluted Liner Ext, NSN: 1310-01-371-1065. The current standard M430A1 warhead has a fluted 60-degree copper cone that lines a Comp A5 high explosive cavity.  The flutes of the copper liner impart counter-rotation to the shaped charge jet to impede degradati on of performance that might otherwise occur from the spin of the projectile. The outer surface of the liner forms the slug and inner surface of the liner material forms the jet.  The detonation wave caused by the initiation of the Comp A5 explosive activa tes the spitback charge causing the walls of the copper liner to collapse forming a jet of molten material that travels at such high velocities that it is capable of penetrating 3 inches of Rolled Homogeneous Armor plate upon impact with the target.  Liner  drawing #12926813 controls its critical dimensions and the production of the liner is inspected in accordance with MIL-C-50862A.  The liner is made either from copper sheet or rolled bar. A respondent to this market survey should be able to show that they  have adequate technical capability, manufacturing capacity and good past performance in the explosives processing industry, as an indicator of your qualifications. Interested companies who have the necessary capabilities should respond by providing the fo llowing information; a brief summary of your companys capabilities, description of facilities, personnel, and related manufacturing experience; estimated minimum and maximum monthly production quantities, estimated prices, and the minimum procurement quan tity (MPQ) required for production. If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate his ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion. If a respondent  chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet these criteria. This information shall be submitted within 10 calendar days from the date of this publication to: US ARMY OPERATIONS SUPP ORT COMMAND, ATTN: AMSOS-PRD/FRANK HOLLEY, E-mail: holleyf@osc.army.mil, BLDG 350, ROCK ISLAND, IL 61299-6000.

<SUBJECT>Z -- U.S. Coast Guard Group Saulte Ste. Marie Housing Repair Market Survey
<DESC>The US Coast Guard Civil Engineering Unit Cleveland is issuing this notice to locate any contractor interested in providing information on the correction of a water intrusion problem at Coast Guard Family Housing in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.

The Coast Guard owns 37 family housing units (some duplex, some stand-alone, to provide a total of 60 residences) in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.  All 37 units, while having different floor plans, were built in 1998 and 1999 using the same basic method of construction, to include mud-slab crawl spaces approximately four (04) feet high in every house.  During construction, while excavating the crawl spaces, it became apparent that some of the units were located in areas with a high water table.  Drain tiles were installed around the perimeter of these houses, draining to sump pumps in the crawl spaces.  The sump pumps then pump the water to dry wells in the yard.  

Approximately 10 of these units, over the past 18 months, have experienced problems with water intrusion into the crawl space.  Water appears to be entering these crawl spaces from cracks in the mud slab or perimeter walls, and carries with it a thick, red sediment.  In a few locations, the sump pumps have difficulty keeping up with the flow of water into the crawl space.  On occasion, some crawl spaces have had 2 to 4 inches of standing water in them.  

The US Coast Guard Civil Engineering Unit Cleveland would like information from interested parties on proven systems or products that create a dry state in areas susceptible to water infiltration.  Information should include a description of the product or system as well as available technical specifications.  A list of successful installation sites for the product or system presented is strongly recommended.  The point of contact for this project is Lieutenant Paul Gregg.  He can be reached at (216) 902-6262, and is available to answer questions or provide amplifying information about the site and present conditions.

<SUBJECT>19 -- SWATH VESSEL
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  The Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) to identify industry's interest either in the design and construction or lease/charter of a Small Waterplane Area Twin Hull (SWATH) vessel to be known as the "Coastal Mapping Vessel." NOAA may issue an RFP as early as March 2003 soliciting industry competition for acquiring a SWATH vessel to improve hydrographic and ocean mapping in the Eastern United States.  If NOAA decides to procure the SWATH under a design and construction contract, the contract cost is to include logistics, i.e. spares, training and manuals.  This Coastal Mapping Vessel is intended to be home-ported in New Hampshire, and will be a versatile platform enabling multi-mission capability with cutting edge research and development in hydrographic and ocean mapping techniques and technologies.  A draft Coastal Mapping Vessel Requirements document is under NOAA review for possible refinement and can be found at http://www.swath.noaa.gov/pdf/attach1.pdf.

If NOAA decides on the design and build approach for a SWATH vessel, the SWATH contract will be in a two (2) step format and NOAA may make multiple awards.  NOAA is considering step one (1) as a preliminary design competition for the firm fixed price of $100K awarded to each successful offeror.   In step one (1), the government may award up to three (3) preliminary design contracts. Step two (2) will be a down-select from step one (1) with an option for construction of one each SWATH vessel.  

Step one (1) has a three (3) month period of performance.  Competing contractors will be responsible for producing their SWATH preliminary designs (modification of existing vessels or new designs) with drawings and data for the government's evaluation at periodic design reviews throughout this step.  At the end of step one (1), projected costs for the contract design and construction price will be required from each contractor. 

Assuming suitable and affordable designs are developed during the first step, NOAA intends to down-select to one contractor's design and exercise the offeror's contract option for step two (2) work.  This second step is expected to cover a nine (9) month performance period during which the contractor will execute the vessel's contract design work and perform model testing.  NOAA will again conduct periodic progress reviews.  At the conclusion of the nine (9) months, NOAA will conduct a final evaluation and if the contractor continues to demonstrate an acceptable design within the projected construction cost, NOAA may exercise the contract option for the vessel's construction.  If the design is not acceptable for construction, NOAA will not exercise the option, and fund no further work.

Interested firms are asked to review the following questions and provide the information requested NLT COB November 27, 2002 in the following format:

1.  Name of Firm/Business
2.  Address of Organization (include city, state and zip code)
POC (include name, title, phone number and email address)
3.  Indicated if your firm is a large or small business and provide the anticipated date of any status change. Give teaming arrangements. State the number of employees under NAICS 336611.

If interested in a Design and Construction Approach:  

1.  Provide your firm's concurrence and/or comments on the Government's acquisition strategy/contract stated above, or give a proposal for an alternate acquisition strategy that may save the Government time, money and facilitate early delivery of the vessel. Comments on the fixed price structure for the two step SWATH procurement?
2.  State your firm's intentions relative to the use of Government facilities and equipment in order to deliver the design.
3.  Give a brief overview of your firm's experience designing SWATH type vessels costing in excess of $5M in the past 5 years.  If none, state your firm's corporate capability relevant to overcoming this experience shortfall.  
4.  Does your firm have experience constructing SWATH type vessels within the past 5 years costing in excess of $5M?  Give displacement and state program/ship contract.
5.  Does your firm have an existing (unmodified) design that you intend to submit for consideration?  Is the design currently built and operating successfully?  If not, to what extent has the design been developed?  Does model test data exist?
6.  To what extent is the design dependent upon foreign designs or products?
7.  Briefly describe your organization's subcontracting strategy including percentage and type.
8.  State if your firm can certify that it has access to all data and intellectual property rights necessary to perform the work.

For firms interested in Charter or Lease, please provide comments on the following business arrangements or suggest other business approaches which can meet the mission requirements at the above URL.

The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS)for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C Terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.
