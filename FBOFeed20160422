<DESC>This contract add-on is for pre-production testing of the DC Motor (PN504606) included in the All Ordnance Destruct System (AODS). AODS is mandatory to perform Flight Tests and Evaluations on the MMIII at Vandenberg Air Force Base. Since Pacific Scientific is the sole source for repair, build and modification of these assets, any pre-production testing for the DC Motor (PN 504606) done anywhere other than Pacific Scientific would incur unnecessary delays and costs to the Government. <br /><br />Therefore, this requirement will be an add-on to the existing sole source storage contract for the continued production of a major system. The program office estimates award to any other vendor would result in unacceptable delays in AODS kit production if pre-production testing is performed outside of Pacific Scientific.<br /><br />The Period of Performance for this Sole Source contract is&nbsp;26 May&nbsp;- 30 December 2016<br /><br />Should a vendor&nbsp;require a copy of the solicitation, please call or email the primary POC.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NCIRD/DVD, 1600 Clifton Rd. NE, Atlanta, GA, 30333, hereby announces its intent to issue a sole source contract in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 to Atlanta Biologicals, 4172 Industry Way, Flowery Branch, GA 30542, to acquire Fetal Bovine Serum used to isolate poliovirus.
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease (NCIRD) has a requirement to acquire Fetal Bovine Serum for use in isolating poliovirus, determining polio immune titers, and developing new vaccines. CDC has been utilizing Atlanta Biologicals' Fetal Bovine Serum since 2011 and maintaining this specific reagent is critical to quality control testing for poliovirus isolation and titration. Replacing this specific reagent without extensive and extended validation studies would critically impact CDC's work on the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, and selecting an alternative source would take seveal months to ensure similar yields and identical results to the current product.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Please forward the capability statement and/or pricing information to David Dombeck, Contract Officer, Reference 2015-80812, Centers for Disease Control, Procurement and Grants Office, ATTN: David Dombeck, MS: K-14, 2920 Brandywine Road, Atlanta, GA 30341.

As part of the conservation stabilization efforts, these items must be properly ventilated and prevent chemical reactivity between the film and its housing in order to ensure that the rate of decay will be as slow as possible. Please see the attached Draft Solicitation for details.

<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of cyber attribution.  The goal of the Enhanced Attribution (EA) program is to develop technologies for generating operationally and tactically relevant information about multiple concurrent independent malicious cyber campaigns, each involving several operators; and the means to share such information with any of a number of interested parties without putting at risk the sources and methods used for collection.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.

<DESC>Defense Logistics Agency - Energy anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) within the next 30-60 days for the management, operation, maintenance, product quality surveillance, inventory control and accounting, security, safety, and environmental protection of the Government-Owned, Contractor-Operated (GOCO) at NAS Rota, Spain.
<p>The Contractor is responsible for operating and maintaining six pantographs, four wide-ranging and two high-lift types. The Contractor shall also operate and maintain the ancillary equipment to include filter separators, meters, pumps, valves, etc., to include the fillstand located next to the booster pump station. The Contractor shall furnish and maintain the tow tractors for transporting the pantographs to the aircraft refueling site and return. Equipment inspections shall be completed and documented on the equipment inspection forms prior to the initial dispatch of the equipment for the duty day. The Contractor shall be responsible for and furnish as required, all technical support, personnel, supervision, equipment, tools, and other items as required.</p>
<p>Contractor responsibility encompasses operation and maintenance of the support facility, a hydrant servicing facility to the south side of the NAS Rota runway, and piping extending to and including a fuel transfer booster pump station as well as the associated pipelines and valves. The main hydrant facility is a compact system consisting of tanks, buildings, fuel delivery equipment referred to as pantographs, and typical fuel system components (electrical, mechanical, and electronic) required to receive and hold jet fuel. Product is dispensed directly to aircraft via the downstream hydrant piping system or to Government-operated fuel servicing trucks at the fillstand located at the hydrant complex inside the airfield compound. The system is supplied by pipeline from the NAS Rota ocean terminal located at the eastern extreme of the base.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for the normal and continuous use, operation, maintenance, and real time reporting of discrepancies applicable to all systems, facilities, and equipment furnished by the Government. Petroleum system means an underground or aboveground fuel storage tank, associated fuel piping, pump house, loading and unloading station, hydrant fuel system and associated hydrant outlets and pantographs, oil water separator, ancillary equipment and appurtenances, electrical power and controls, lighting, emergency generators, refueler truck parking, fire protection system, and containment system, if any. The Contractor shall manage, coordinate, oversee, and report as needed to ensure all required inspections, services, maintenance and repairs of all facilities, equipment and real property associated with this contract are performed as required to ensure compliance with all Navy, Department of Defense (DoD), State, Local, Federal, American Petroleum Institute (API), and Unified Forces Criteria (UFC) requirements throughout the life of the contract. This includes monitoring all maintenance being performed by Government agencies, or other contractors to verify that it is requested in a timely manner, scheduled as required, coordinated with relevant offices, finished to completion, and recorded in the maintenance database.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure that all Government property is preserved and maintained in a safe working condition. Preventative Maintenance (PM) tasks are defined as maintenance work to preserve a facility by preventing its deterioration; such as, but not limited to, corrosion control, grounds keeping, pressure washing, cleaning, spot painting, housekeeping, etc. It is essential that the Contractor devote adequate effort to identifying future deficiencies and potential deficiencies in order to prioritize PM efforts. PM includes performing, at a minimum, the services recommended by the manufacturer or in accordance with commercially accepted practices, as well as the effort required to keep a facility, a piece of equipment or system functioning. While the Government does not plan to dictate specific PM requirements or practices, the Contractor's maintenance plan shall provide a systematic approach to identifying, planning, scheduling, documenting/reporting, and managing labor, materials, and time to perform those actions that contribute to the uninterrupted functioning of the fuel terminal.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform Operator Maintenance. Operator maintenance is defined as maintenance performed by the operator and is the care and minor maintenance of equipment using procedures that do not require detailed technical knowledge of the equipment's or system's function and design. This category of maintenance normally consists of inspecting, cleaning, servicing, preserving, lubricating, and adjusting, as required. Such maintenance may also include simple parts replacement that can be performed with only basic mechanical skills and simple hand tools. The Contractor shall not provide maintenance or repair beyond afore mentioned maintenance unless directed by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall visually inspect the exterior of all storage tanks, to include small connected or free standing residual product collection tanks, and tank components and visually examine the various samples taken from the tanks on a continuous basis. All inspections and visual examinations shall be documented and corrective action within the scope of PM/operator maintenance accomplished as deficiencies are noted. The Contractor is responsible for keeping the tank exterior clean, free of mold, dirt, and rust. The Contractor will pressure wash, remove corrosion, apply corrosion inhibitor and spot paint as needed. Maintenance requirements such as the need for exterior corrosion control and painting of tank(s) and tank inspection/cleaning as may be indicated by the visual examination of drawn samples shall be recorded on the appropriate inspection documents.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall ensure that all buildings, structures, and facilities used by or under Contractor control are kept clean and sanitary. The Contractor shall sweep, mop, and wax floors, wash windows, and walls of occupied buildings or office spaces so as to present a clean, sanitary, and orderly appearance. Food storage and preparation areas shall be maintained in an orderly and sanitary condition. Clothing locker and change areas shall be kept orderly and clothing hung or kept in lockers. Maintenance and storage buildings shall be kept in clean and orderly manner. Areas immediately around buildings for which the Contractor is responsible shall be kept free of debris. The Contractor shall not allow fire hazards, such as oily rags, loose paper, and trash to accumulate in or around buildings, structures, facilities, or areas used, occupied, or controlled by the Contractor. The Contractor shall reset circuit breakers and switches, furnish and replace burned out standard and fluorescent lights, and plunge sinks and toilets to keep them serviceable.</p>

<p>Several documents related to this solicitation will be posted as "secured" in the FedBizOpps website. Please find below instructions to access secured documents in FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>Instructions for access to the FBO Secure Site:</p>
<p>To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in the Federal Business Opportunity ("FedBizOpps" or "FBO") system, offerors must:</p>
<p>1. Be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Please note that SAM has replaced the previous system Central Contractor Registration (CCR). If an entity was previously registered in CRR the information should have transferred into SAM. You just need to set up a SAM account and migrate your CCR roles.</p>
<p>2. Once registered in SAM, go to the FBO website at www.fbo.gov https://www.fbo.gov/ and log in. Verify your registration within the FBO system. The FBO Vendor Guide is available at https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf to provide assistance.</p>
<p>3. Once your SAM registration is verified in the FBO system, click on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD2345 - Military Critical Technical Data Agreement Form. You can also find the DD2345 at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf. Fill out the DD2345 form and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on the form. JCP will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date within five days of receipt. Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect. Additionally, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.</p>
<p>4. Once you receive the approved DD2345 form from JCP and have verified your status on the JCP website, http://www.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/jcp/search.aspx, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link. The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN. The MPIN number is a mandatory data element created by the CCR registrant and must have nine characters: at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number. No spaces or special characters are permitted. It allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also serves as a validation to access sensitive but unclassified documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.</p>
<p>5. Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors will submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button. Once vendors request explicit access, the FBO system will send notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, who will approve the request in the system. Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.</p>
<p>Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system, and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.</p>

<p>Quantity: 671. Unit of Issue: EA. Destination Information: New Cumberland, PA.</p>
<p>The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 10 MAY 2016. The Small Business size standard is 1000 employees. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved sources: PARKER-HANNIFIN CORPORATION (93835), PNEUDRAULICS, INC. (06177), and AUSCO, INC. (06239).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Various increments solicited: 300-399, 400-699, and 700-850.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis provides notification that National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters, intends to proceed to Phase II on the solicitation, entitled "Advanced Oxygen Recovery for Spacecraft Life Support Systems," which was originally synopsized on April 9, 2014, and posted to NSPIRES as an Appendix (NNH14ZOA001N-14GCD-C2) to the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) NASA Research Announcement (NRA), titled "Space Technology Research, Development, Demonstration, and Infusion 2014 (SpaceTech-REDDI-2014)." The Phase II Request Letter will be provided to the current Phase I contractors (listed below) on or about May 12, 2016.<br /><br />The Government is conducting a phased acquisition involving a progressive competitive down-selection process (see 1817.7301-5). Competition for subsequent phases will build on the results of the previous phases. Phase I was the Engineering Development Unit Hardware Phase with a 15 month period of performance (4/1/15 - 6/30/16). Phase II is the Brassboard Hardware Phase with an expected duration of up to 24 months. The award criteria for subsequent phases will include demonstrated completion of previous phase requirements. The Government expects that only the initial phase contractors will be capable of successfully competing for the subsequent phase(s). Proposals for the subsequent phase(s) will be requested from these contractors. The Government does not intend to issue a new, formal solicitation for subsequent phases(s). Request letters will be issued for each subsequent phase to provide guidance on proposal content and evaluation criteria. Each subsequent phase will be synopsized. Notwithstanding the expectation that only the initial phase contractors will be capable of successfully competing for the subsequent phase(s), proposals from all responsible sources submitted, by the proposal due date, will be considered. In order to contend for subsequent phase awards, however, such prospective offerors must demonstrate a design maturity equivalent to that of the prior phase contractors and that the proposed technology meets the required TRL for the phase and category of work sought and further advancement of the TRL as required through all phases. In addition, proposals must demonstrate completion of all previous phase requirements and progress toward performance goals as outlined in the Appendix as applicable. Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the design maturity and appropriate TRL may render the proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award. Offerors not awarded a Phase I contract, that intend to propose to Phase II, shall submit an email to the address below stating its intent by COB May 6, 2016 in order to receive a Request Letter.<br /><br />The current Phase I contractors are as follows: <br />GCDP-02-TA-15015, NASA Glenn Research Center <br />GCDP-02-TA-15016, NASA Glenn Research Center <br />NNL15AA04C, UMPQUA Research Company <br />NNL15AA08C, University of Texas at Arlington<br /><br />Technical, programmatic, and procurement comments and questions may be addressed by e-mail to HQ-STMD-GCDC2@mail.nasa.gov . Responses to inquiries will be answered via e-mail and will be provided to all offerors. <br />

<p>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION<br />The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted. Specifically, Siemens Medical Solutions is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the MRI equipment requiring service and the equipment is proprietary to the company. As such, only Siemens Medical Solutions is authorized to provide service and parts for the equipment requiring maintenance and does not authorize third parties to service their equipment. Use of any other contractor would place equipment integrity in jeopardy which would then risk continuity of science; should the equipment not remain fully functional to original equipment manufacturer standards, standardization of NIDA IRP longitudinal research study data would be jeopardized and any loss of this data would be to the serious detriment of the NIDA mission. Accordingly, only Siemens Medical Solutions is capable of providing the required maintenance support services. <br />Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc<br />40 Liberty Blvd<br />Malvern, PA 19355<br /><br />CLOSING STATEMENT<br />THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov." <br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />All responses must be received by the closing date and time of this announcement and must reference the solicitation number.  Responses may be submitted electronically to Farrin Stanton, Contract Specialist, at Farrin.Stanton@nih.gov. US Mail and Fax responses will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC><p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to re-compete a requirement currently being performed by BioReliance Inc. under NIA Contract HHSN271201100006C. This procurement is being competed under full and open competitive procedures under FAR Part 15. It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement type contract will be awarded for a five (5) year period of performance beginning on or about May 1, 2016.  The anticipated level of effort is approximately 1/2 FTE each year, to develop, maintain and distribute a repository of tissues from aged rodents for use by investigators in studies of aging.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE</span></p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) supports through contracts several colonies of aged rats and mice for use in research on aging. Some investigators do not need live animals, but simply collect specific tissue from the animals for their experiments. The purpose of this contract is to provide a source of fresh-frozen tissue, suitable for multiple experimental protocols, from the NIA colonies of aged rats and mice. This will allow multiple investigators to make use of different tissues from the same animals, and will lower the cost of tissue for those investigators.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OBJECTIVES</span></p>
<p>The Contractor shall receive mice and rats selected by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) from the NIA colonies and shipped at no cost to the Contractor, and shall upon receipt of the animals assign an identification number to each animal, record vital statistics, and collect, flash-freeze, package, label and store tissues, and ship tissues to investigators at the direction of the COR. The number of animals to be sent for tissue collection each year is dependent on need. A total of 150 animals per year shall be received by the Contractor, in groups of no more than 5 animals per week. Eighty percent (80%) of the collections shall be the basic collection schedule and twenty percent (20%) shall be the comprehensive collection schedule. The COR shall determine the specific strain, age and gender of the animals to be sent, as well as the schedule for submission of animals for tissue collection.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall transfer the existing aged rodent tissue bank holdings from the existing contract to the Contractor's facilities. The transfer shall be accomplished in such a way to prevent any thawing of frozen tissues. The current contract aged rodent tissue bank consists of approximately 6,600 frozen tissue samples in two freezers and 500 glass slides stored at room temperature.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the animals, the Contractor shall maintain them for three days under conditions where they will not be exposed to disease or other animals. Animals shall be maintained in filtered cages, no more than 3 rats or 5 mice per cage, with ad libitum food and water, a temperature range of 70-75oF and a 12/12 hour light/dark cycle. NIH31 laboratory diet (Rader et al., 1986, J. Nutrition 116:1777-88) shall be autoclaved, water shall be autoclaved, and cage bedding shall be autoclaved. Cages shall meet ILAR minimum floor space requirements per animals and population size as stated in NIH publication No. 85-23 entitled "Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals" (text available at http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/labrats/ ).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall record on the Vital Statistics Information Sheet the date of accession, strain, gender, age, weight, barrier of origin, special notes such as caloric restricted, and general condition including visible lesions. The Contractor shall euthanize each animal individually by CO2 asphyxiation and immediately collect, freeze and store the following tissues (flash-frozen in LN2 and stored at -70 to -80oC): Basic Schedule - serum, brain, eyes, heart, muscle, kidneys, lungs, liver; or Comprehensive schedule - Basic Schedule plus spleen, ovary or testes, pancreas, small intestine, prostate, skin, white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, thymus, adrenal gland, and any tumors found. The Contractor shall provide immersion fixation of tissues with ethanol or formalin for special cases designated by the COR in order to meet the needs of NIA-funded projects and to prepare tissue arrays. Tissues fixed for investigators' special requests shall be stored at room temperature or at 4oC as instructed by the COR, and shipped to the investigator in the fixative. Tissues fixed for tissue arrays shall be embedded in paraffin and arrays prepared at the direction of the COR. Master blocks of tissue arrays are prepared and sectioned onto glass slides (1" x 3"), and stored at room temperature. It is estimated that one (1) tissue array will be made per year. The Contractor shall use an appropriate mechanism for inventory control of frozen tissue, fixed tissue, embedded tissue, and tissue arrays. The Contractor shall maintain frozen tissues in two freezers, each of which is equipped with an independent alarm system and back-up generator. Approximately half of each sample cohort of tissue (same strain, age, gender) shall be maintained in each freezer. The Contractor shall ship tissues and tissue arrays to investigators at the direction of the COR.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REQUIRED REPORTS AND DELIVERABLES</span></p>
<p>The following reports will be required:</p>
<p>(1) Weekly Inventory Report; <br />(2) Vital Statistics Sheets; <br />(3) Semi-Annual Progress Reports; <br />(4) Final Report; and <br />(5) Contract Closeout</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION </span></p>

This brochure identifies the technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>Overview of the Requirement and the Purpose of the Notice
The purpose of this Notice is to identify the availability of capable small business concerns (e.g., 8(a), veteran owned, service-disabled veteran owned, Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone), small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and economically disadvantaged woman owned) and other than Small Business that can perform: (1) agricultural market analysis, (2) agricultural marketing strategy and planning, (3) design and content development to support scaling of new agricultural technologies, and (4) marketing campaign development and execution to reach indirect beneficiaries of agricultural technologies in Feed the Future countries. USAID seeks to obtain industry questions and/or comments for this planned new activity, Feed the Future (FTF) Marketing to Scale. USAID intends to award a single contract for this new activity.  Given the nature of this award, the leadership of this project must foster a productive working relationship with multiple stakeholders, USAID Missions and Washington offices, International Agriculture Research Centers, Innovation Labs, Implementing Partners, FtF-supported Micro-, Small- and Medium sized Enterprises (MSMEs), notably seed companies.  The attached Concept Note presents the current draft objectives and key elements of the activity. The level of funding allocated for this project is expected to range between $16 million and $24 million over a five-year implementation period.
This is not an invitation for bid, request for proposal or other solicitation; and in no way obligates the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to award a contract.

<DESC><p>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis; there is no solicitation available. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only to assess whether there are businesses capable of providing sustainment support for a Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) System that counters Man Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS) and portable air defense missiles for use on Department of Defense (DoD), other United States government aircraft and select foreign military sales. The LAIRCM System is an on-aircraft laser-based countermeasure defensive system, protecting Air Force personnel on multiple high profile and critical airframes vital to the defense of the U.S. and its allies. The LAIRCM System is installed on more than 21 different U.S. and foreign aircraft Mission Design Series (MDS) operating throughout the world. The acquisition strategy has not yet been determined. Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining the specific acquisition strategy to be utilized in the event the USAF elects to acquire the sustainment support services described in the announcement.</p>
<p>The program is entering the sustainment phase of the life cycle and is looking to make use of service-based sustainment activities. Note: Currently, there are plans to hold an Industry Day the week of 11 April 2016. More information will be forthcoming through future postings on the Federal Business Opportunities site.</p>
<p>If there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a Small Business Set-Aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding team arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>If this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.<br />If a company is capable of some, but not all of the consolidated requirements stated in this sources sought synopsis, please provide a response that explains the requirements for which you are capable.</p>
<p>Please review this announcement in its entirety. Request that respondents complete and return a capabilities statement, as described below, to identify firms that possess the capability to provide sustainment support for the LAIRCM system that counters MANPADS and portable air defense missiles to WPAFB OH. <br /><br />This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. The Government is in no way obligated to do business with or to enter into any form of contract with any person, firm or other entity that receives or responds to this announcement. <br /><br />The required level of security clearance is SECRET. A Foreign Ownership, Controlled or Influenced (FOCI) may submit capability statements in response to this SSS provided it has a Special Security Agreement with Defense Security Service. Proof of the Special Security Agreement must be provided with the submitted capability statement.</p>
<p>ALL INQUIRIES AND/OR RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN NOON, LOCAL TIME, ON 24 MARCH 2016.</p>
<p>This announcement requests businesses in the industry and other interested parties provide feedback, which will help improve WPAFB's understanding of the industry and its ability to satisfy this requirement. WPAFB is particularly interested in the availability and potential size of discounts and savings that may result from the sustainment of the LAIRCM system for large aircraft that counters MANPADS and portable air defense missiles.</p>

<DESC><strong>Request for Information: <br />H-1 Sustaining Engineering Support Services <br /><br /></strong>This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources that may be able to provide engineering support for the United States Air Force (USAF) TH-1H and UH-1N helicopter platforms hereby referred to collectively as H-1. This support will provide the USAF H-1 System Program Office (SPO) technical expertise, access to Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) proprietary data including but not limited to structural/component data, drawings, qualification data, and analysis techniques as required to adequately maintain operational, safety, suitability, and effectiveness (OSS&amp;E) for the H-1 platform.<br />Sole source to Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. is anticipated due to the lack of proprietary data, and most importantly, the engineering expertise needed to perform this support effort. An Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for one (1) ordering period plus four (4) additional ordering period options is anticipated. <br />Contractor shall furnish all material, support equipment, tools, test equipment, and services. The contractor is responsible for providing, maintaining, and calibrating all support equipment required at their facility or a subcontractor's facility. Contractor furnished material or parts used for replacement shall equal or exceed the quality of the original material or parts. <br />Contractors/Institutions responding to this market research are placed on notice that participation in this survey may not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The government will not reimburse participants for any expenses associated with their participation in this survey.<br />In accordance with FAR 52.215-3:<br />a. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.<br />b. Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.<br />c. This solicitation is issued for the purpose of market research.
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INSTRUCTIONS: <br /></span></strong>1. Below is a document containing a description of the H-1 Engineering Support Services requirement and a Contractor Capability Survey, which allows you to provide your company's capability.</p>
<p>2. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide documentation may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)</p>
<p>a. Identify any areas of work that your organization believes should be broken out exclusively for Small Business.</p>
<p>3. Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">4. Questions relative to this market survey should be addressed to William Grun, (478) 926-4430, william.grun@us.af.mil. <br />&emsp;<br /><strong>Request for Information: H-1 Engineering Support Services<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION</span></strong><br />The US Air Force currently has 90 H-1 helicopters, distributed throughout a number of US Air Force units within the United States and overseas bases. UH-1N helicopters are specially equipped to operate in search and rescue, missile support, training, VIP transport, and special operation force missions. The TH-1H helicopters are the sole rotary wing aircraft used by the USAF for undergraduate pilot production.</p>
<p>At least a portion of the UH-1N fleet is expected to remain in service until 2042. While the government had a full data package delivered with the aircraft in the 1960's, the data has not been maintained over the years to a level that adequately captures all design changes since aircraft delivery. A multi-disciplined engineering team with expert knowledge is needed to provide repair instructions which may require modification support, accident investigation support, re-qualification data, and technical order changes. Life cycle sustainability for the H-1 necessitates engineering support available through a contractual agreement.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the UH-1N organic repair depot at Cherry Point acquires engineering assistance to resolve Periodic Depot Maintenance (PDM) issues beyond the published technical orders. The US Government engineers require access to engineering data to effectively resolve any PDM issues and manage requirements.</p>
<p>We are conducting market research to identify potential sources of expert knowledge, drawings, technical data specifications, proprietary data, analysis and reports pertaining to H-1 helicopters as requested by the Government. The offeror shall provide engineering assistance for repair questions and modification of the H-1 for which the Government does not have the expertise necessary to take such actions independently.</p>
<p>In addition, the offeror shall support mishap investigations and provide solutions to grounding issues. Aircraft on Ground (AOG) situations dictate timely responses. Field technical assistance requests immediately impacting mission requirements must be resolved within five (5) days of receipt. USAF may require immediate assistance with expert technical knowledge in these instances.</p>

<DESC><p>Request for Information (RFI)</p>
<p>Affordable Manufacture of Free-Form Prism Eyepiece Optics</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION: No award will be made as a result of this request. This Request for Information (RFI) is for informational purposes only; this is not an Invitation for Bid (IFB), a Request for Proposal (RFP), or Request for Quotation (RFQ). No solicitation document exists and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI. The Government will not be liable for payment of any response preparation expenses and is in no way obligated by the information received. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing a future acquisition strategy, Performance Work Statement, Statement of Objectives and/or Performance Based Specification(s). Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. NOTE: The use of RFI Number W909MY-16-R-C016 is for tracking purposes only.</p>
<p>BACKGROUD/DESCRIPTION: The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground - Belvoir (ACC-APG-Belvoir) is conducting Market Research on behalf of the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. NVESD is searching for sources of affordable free form prism eyepiece optics.</p>
<p>CERDEC NVESD is seeking to develop affordable manufacturing processes to realize free-form prism eyepiece optics which can be demonstrated in head-mounted display systems. Free-form prism eyepieces have been successfully demonstrated by NVESD under the "High Definition Aviation Digital Display" (HiDADD) program to offer excellent optical performance and user comfort when coupled with a micro-display. NVESD therefore intends to develop a competitive industrial capability to manufacture free-form prism eyepiece optical elements. Details of the free-form optical design techniques may be obtained from the following technical journal article: APPLIED OPTICS, 10 May 2009 / Vol. 48, No. 14, "Design of an optical see-through head-mounted display with a low f-number and large field of view using a freeform prism." This technology requires the fabrication and bonding of two plastic prism halves, with each half possessing multiple free-form surfaces, and with free-form surfaces meeting at a bonded or cemented boundary. Relevant manufacturing technology therefore includes multi-axis single-point diamond turning, plastic molding, hard coating of optical plastics, and integral opto-mechanical design for snap-fit integration and self-alignment.</p>
<p>NVESD is currently seeking sources who can perform the following mandatory manufacturing improvement efforts:</p>
<p>1. Demonstrate how a baseline process (i.e., work procedure &amp; traveler) and associated unit production cost can be improved by the efforts developed under this effort.</p>
<p>2. Ensure the production unit cost is less than the targeted military unit price of $750 per monocular eyepiece assembly (This cost does not include the display panel, electronics, or external mounting components).</p>
<p>3. Fulfill a range of projected production rates from 500 units/year up to 10,000 units/year.</p>
<p>NVESD is additionally seeking optical fabrication sources who can perform the following efforts:</p>
<p>1. Develop baseline processes based on final designs and test parameters desired by the system integrators.</p>
<p>2. Evolve the fabrication steps to continually reduce manufacturing costs through a series of three or more batch iterations totaling several hundred finished sample optical elements.</p>
<p>3. Produce free form prism eyepiece samples that will then be transitioned to the display integrators who will integrate the eyepieces into working demonstrator display systems for final quality evaluations.</p>
<p>In the event a solicitation is issued in relation to this requirement, the Government would focus the effort on the manufacturing processes and cost reduction(s). The Government would additionally provide a nominal free form prism optical prescription and performance specification which could then be directly transferred by the contractor into CAD models for mechanical feature development and tool path generation. The Government design may include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Be appropriate for an average military requirement with 25 mm eye relief<br />&bull; Have approximately 40 degree horizontal field of view<br />&bull; Be in full color,<br />&bull; Be roughly an 18.432 mm horizontal format with up to 1900 active pixels.</p>
<p>Data Rights</p>
<p>It is desirable that data be received with unlimited rights to the Government. However, it is recognized that proprietary data may be included with the information provided. If so, it is the responsibility of the interested party submitting data to clearly mark such proprietary information and clearly separate it from the unrestricted information as an addendum. No Classified data shall be provided via email.</p>

<p>In response to this sources sought, provide a response to each of the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Name of the firm, point of contact, phone number, email address, DUNS number, CAGE code, a statement regarding small business status (including small business type(s)/certifications(s) such as SDB, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.) and the corresponding NAICS code.</p>
<p>2. Would an Industry Day Forum for this requirement be beneficial (Why or why not)? If an Industry Day were to be held, how many personnel from your company would you anticipate attending?

<p>4. What is the minimum and maximum dollar value project on which your firm would routinely consider submitting a proposal?</p>
<p>5.

<p>9. What is a reasonable phase-in period for a contractor to be fully operational at a new MFGI site that was newly activated by the Army?</p>
<p>10. What do you see as the primary risk areas and/or potential issues associated with an acquisition of this type? How do you propose this risk(s) can be mitigated (if any)?</p>
<p>11. Which contract type do you consider most advantageous for this type of requirement (e.g. Cost-type, Firm Fixed-Price (FFP), a combination type contract) and why? Also, if the workload data is insufficient upon release of the RFP, will you submit a proposal with reasonable risk? If not, other than incumbent manning that cannot be provided, what additional data would be required that would assist in your price development? (Please be specific)</p>
<p>12. Provide your input to a source selection method that would provide the best value to the Government. If a full technical/cost/past performance tradeoff is recommended, provide supporting information describing areas where the Government could receive benefit that might relate to an additional expense/cost to the contract.</p>
<p>13. If a contract for services of this type were awarded with a 10 year ordering period, what would be the pros and cons of 10 year contract? What would be the pros and cons of a five year contract?</p>
<p>14. The NAICS code contemplated for this requirement is 561210, Facilities Support Services industry, with a size standard of $38.5M. In your opinion, does this NAICS code fit this requirement? If not, which NAICS code would you suggest and why?</p>
<p>15. Please provide any recommendations to improve the approach/specifications/draft PWS/PRS to acquiring the identified items/services.</p>
<p>Please note: The Army is interested in maximum effective competition.

This Request for Information / Sources Sought Synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement. Any costs incurred by interested vendors in response to this announcement or incurred for participation in the Market Survey will NOT be reimbursed. All information marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-Government personnel and entities. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary. The results of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement.

1.	What potential ambiguities exist in the draft Statement of Work that would necessitate further details prior to soliciting for these services?
 
2.	The Government is considering the acquisition of these services utilizing a firm-fixed-price contract type.  Please indicate any concerns that your organization may have in responding to a firm-fixed-price solicitation and whether the use of a firm-fixed-price contract type would discourage your firm from participating in any potential solicitation for these services.

3.	Please provide a very brief description of your organizations experience and capabilities to meet the requirements identified in the draft Statement of Work.

4.	Are the services available from your organization under a General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule?  If so, please provide your organization's GSA contract number.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) intends to issue a procurement for the subject research study in Fiscal Year 2016 and is seeking statements of capability from potential offerors. Preference will be given to small businesses with experience and staffing to perform the requirement as demonstrated in their capability statement.
<p>FNS is seeking a contractor to conduct a series of studies that will assess the implementation processes, outcomes, and, as necessary, the impacts of six different grant programs awarded by the Child Nutrition (CN) program. The CN grants include: 1) Team Nutrition Training grants; 2) Chefs Move to School; 3) Farm to School (FTS) grants; 4) Direct Certification Improvement Grants; 5) Equipment Purchase Grants; and 6) Administrative Review and Training Grants. For each grant program, the contractor will design and conduct an independent evaluation study, however they may be carried out simultaneously. Each evaluation will be tailored to the specific settings, target audience(s), and anticipated outcomes of the particular grant program. All studies will be national in scope, require primary data collection and analysis as well as secondary data analysis. Additionally, the contractor will provide technical assistance for grantees to support their own evaluations and provide guidance to practitioners, grantees, and FNS to inform changes to subsequent grant application materials, project monitoring plans, and reporting processed to support ongoing evaluation efforts. Approaches to evaluating program outcomes and impacts will vary.<br />Findings from these studies will quantify and describe the activities funded by each grant, determine (to the extent possible) their impact on relevant outcomes, and provide analysis to inform FNS decision-making to improve the parameters and requirements of future grant awards.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a notification that the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a sole source, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract under statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy the Agency Requirements. This contract will be awarded to Alaska Aerospace Corporation (AAC), 4300 B St # 101, Anchorage, AK, 99503, to support flight test requirements for the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) in the Pacific Northwest at the Pacific Spaceport Complex Alaska (PSCA), in Kodiak, Alaska.
<p>The MDA has a requirement to flight test the missile defense systems in realistic deployment scenarios including the interception of target vehicles, track exercises and interoperations with other missile defense systems. MDA requires use of a launch facility and range services in the Pacific Northwest to conduct these tests. The PSCA's unique combination of geography, force protection, and infrastructure capability is unavailable at any other land-based location in the Northern Pacific Region of the BMDS Test Bed. There are no other options currently available for long-range Space launches from the Northern Pacific. AAC has management authority of the PSCA per Alaska Statute, and removal of AAC as the PSCA operator would require a change to the Alaska Legislation.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541712 with a size standard of 1,250 employees. This NAICS is applicable for subcontracting opportunities.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for proposals. This action will result in an IDIQ contract. The resultant contract for these services will be a one 5-year base and one 1-year option. Any information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for enhancing competition in a future competitive procurement. The Government will not pay for information submitted. All responses must be received no later than May 9, 2016, 2:00 pm, central time and should be submitted to Sherry B. Trowbridge, Contracting Officer, via email at sherry.trowbridge@mda.mil. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.</p>

<DESC><p>The Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) Contingency Contracting Office (CCO) is conducting a market survey by issuing this Request for Information (RFI) notice for qualified firms capable of providing a Waste Thermal Destruction System (Incinerator) designed for small expeditious camp use. The Incinerator will be used for burning personnel and medical waste aboard a Forward Operating Location in Kenya, Africa. Applicable NAICS Code 236210 Industrial Building Construction, Incinerator, mass burn type, construction.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice shall be submitted in writing electronically and must be received no later than 2pm EST, Tuesday 2 May 2016. No telephone inquiries shall be accepted or returned. The specifications for the incinerator and subsequent anticipated labor is attached. Please send all responses directly to <a href="mailto:jessycca.e.mckellop.mil@mail.mil">jessycca.e.mckellop.mil@mail.mil</a></p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their ability to timely provide all materials and labor to install an incinerator at Camp Simba, Manda Bay, Kenya. Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. Responses should include: company name, service capability statement, examples of similar facilities to which same or similar services were provided; DUNS number, including address, point of contact, and the size of the business. Potential sources should validate current concepts in the attached Statement of Work (SOW) on terms of realism and determine any problems or concerns in shipment and installation in the austere environment found in Kenya. Additionally, we are seeking information on alternative approaches to defined specs within the SOW. Currently, the incinerator is expected to support a small population of up to 550 persons. The need for medical waste disposal is small, expected to be less than 100 pounds annually. It is currently anticipated that contract will be required to provide all necessary tools and equipment required to complete the project.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked as proprietary will be handled accordingly. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>A solicitation is NOT currently available. If a solicitation is issued, all interested parties must respond to the solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement.</p>

<DESC>Project Title: Former Kansas Army Ammunition Plant (KSAAP) 1200 Area Remedial Action Services;<br />Location: Parsons, Labette County, Kansas;<br />Response Date: 13 May 2016, no later than 1:00 PM (CST-Kansas City, MO), electronic submittals (see below email address for submittal POC);<br />Contract Specialist: Ronica Smith, Ronica.R.Smith@usace.army.mil.<br /><br />This is a Sources Sought Announcement ONLY; no solicitation exists at this time. In response to the Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of the Army (DA) Performance-Based Acquisition (PBA) initiative, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Northwestern Division, Kansas City District, is seeking information on sources that provide performance-based environmental remediation services. The U.S. Government desires to procure the environmental cleanup services on a small business set-aside basis, provided two or more qualified small businesses respond to this sources sought synopsis with information sufficient to support a set-aside. Be advised that the U.S. Government will not be able to set aside this requirement if two or more small businesses do not respond with information to support the set-aside. We encourage all small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantaged Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business concerns), to identify their capabilities in meeting the requirement at a fair market price. <br />This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ, IFB, or RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids, or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this sources sought notice. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFQ, or IFB, or RFP, is any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on FedBizOpps.gov. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor FedBizOpps.gov for addition information pertaining to this requirement. The anticipated NAICS code is 562910 Environmental Remediation Services, Size Standard in Number of Employees: 750.<br />Anticipated work shall be conducted under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Program, which falls under the Army Environmental Cleanup Program. The Site, a former ammunition plant is a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) facility that closed in 2008 and since that time, has been transferred and sold to various private entities. The U.S. Army is retaining clean-up authority at various Solid Waste Management Units at this site. <br />It is anticipated that if a solicitation results from this notice, it will be to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for approximately not to exceed $10 Million, set-aside for Small Business. <br />Project Objectives: Planning document preparation; Abandon monitoring wells; Blast and/or hydraulically hammer contaminated limestone; Excavate and segregate overburden soil and/or previous backfill soil; Dewater selected excavation areas and dispose of contaminated groundwater; Stockpile uncontaminated overburden soil/previous backfill; Dispose of contaminated overburden soil and limestone; Backfill excavation areas; Restore and re-vegetate the site; and Final report preparation. The extent of surface soil and bedrock removal will be dictated by analytical sampling results. It is estimated that 7,000 bulk cubic yards (bcyds) of overburden material will need to be managed and segregated for both re-use and offsite disposal. It is estimated that 17,000 bycds of limestone bedrock will be required to be removed, sampled and disposed of off-site. Shallow groundwater levels are present in the area and thus required to be managed. It is proposed that excavations be dewatered, treated and disposed of at the onsite Sewage Treatment Plan or disposed of without treatment at an offsite disposal facility. A dewatering system designed will be required to handle approximately 1,080,000 gallons of groundwater contaminated with total chromium and hexavalent chromium. Once sampling confirms all contaminated overburden and bedrock has been removed, backfill operations will commence. All planning documents, to include excavation and backfill plans and dewatering plans, will require Army and regulatory approval prior to the start of field work. Final documentation of project activities and results will need to be prepared and submitted to Army and regulatory agencies for approval.<br />Submittals shall not exceed 5 pages (8-1/2 x 11). Times Roman Number, 12 font, with one (1) inch margins. Bulleted responses are acceptable. Please provide the following:<br />1.)

<DESC>Synopsis: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - St. Paul District is seeking capability statements from all firms interested in proposed guidewall crib repair projects at Lock and Dams 5, 6, 8, and 9.<br /><br />The upper and lower guidewall crib grouting projects consist of stabilizing the pile foundation with a flowable grout. The guide walls are founded on timber piles and a rock filled crib. Voids have been created in the rock filled crib due to wash out and settlement of the rock within the crib. These voids as well as the spaces between the rocks need to be filled with grout to stabilize the structure and prevent further erosion of the guidewall's foundations. The contractor shall provide all plant labor and material to complete the contract requirements. This contract involves placing and sealing forms around the guidewall foundations and placing flowable grout to entirely fill the voids in the rock filled crib. This work will be accomplished during the non-navigation season, which is generally between December and mid March. The Corps is looking to complete all four (4) locks between the end of the 2017 and the start of the 2018 navigational seasons.

<DESC>VA intends to award an Architect/Engineer contract for complete design services (preliminary concepts and layouts, program development, investigative services, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, cost estimating services, and construction period services) for the Roof Replacement Design, Project# 528A4-14-202. 

This is a 100% total service disabled veteran owned small business set aside. 

This project proposes to design and provide construction period services for the removal, repair, and replacement of most of the roofing systems at the VAWNYHCS Batavia site. VAWNYHCS Batavia site is made up of approximately 30 separate buildings (approximately 320,000 square feet of building space) with a mixture of high and low slope roof systems. Approximately 20 of those buildings fall within the scope of this effort.  In addition to the roof systems, subsystems to be considered under this scope include but are not limited to roof structure, insulation, lightning protection (including grounding), waterproofing (flashing, etc.), and drainage (scuppers/gutters/down spouts). Site grading for drainage and foundation drainage are NOT part of this effort. If other non-roof system or subsystem damage due to water intrusion is identified (e.g. missing/damaged masonry mortar, mold growth, damaged insulation, drywall staining/damage, and ceiling tile staining/damage, etc.), it should be assessed for severity and documented as part of the assessment.  Services shall include, multi-disciplinary investigative services, initial conceptual drawings, attending required design/review meetings, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, cost estimating services, and construction period services which shall include final punch list compilation and as-built drawings. Deliverables being provided to the VA may include initial conceptual drawings (50%), schematic drawings (100%), 80%, and 100% drawings and specifications for review and approval, and 100% construction documents provided in multiple sized copies. 
The intent is for the design to occur during FY2016 and continue through FY2017 with construction likely beginning in FY2018.

<DESC>The Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Installation Contracting Agency/KD (AFICA/KD) at Offutt AFB, NE intends to enter into a sole source award with Wikistrat, Inc, 58 E 11th St FL 8, New York, 10003-6020, under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 to carry out an approximately $300,000.00 three month period of performance study to investigate the feasibility and strategic implications of a program called Ultra-Low Cost Access to Space (ULCATS) for National Defense University (NDU) and the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC).
<p>DTIC serves the DoD community as the largest central resource for DoD and government-funded scientific, technical, engineering, and business related information available today. Information Analysis Centers (IACs) (http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/iac/) are research and analysis organizations established by the DoD and operated by DTIC to help researchers, engineers, scientists and program managers utilize existing Scientific and Technical Information (STI) to solve their most difficult challenges.</p>
<p>This effort includes first identifying the scope and nature of challenges facing NDU and DoD in anticipating technology and process innovations, and then using this knowledge to draft anticipatory procedures. This effort is investigating the potential merits, strategic implications and feasibility of ULCATS, which is focused on stimulating efforts within the private sector to develop and demonstrate new space transportation capabilities for potential government use. Such commercial technology could prove to be much cheaper and more reliable than traditional U.S. government capabilities in space transportation. These commercial systems might create new methods for delivering payloads to low-Earth orbit (LEO) with dual use benefits to both commercial industry and U.S. government, including national security, other military applications and government civilian agency purposes. This effort will produce additional, improved insights into technology and process innovation at the DTIC and DoD level to supplement the current Defense Innovation Marketplace.</p>
<p>Given the complexities of the collaborative nature of the requirement and expertise involved to accomplish the study, the Government believes that only a contractor with nationally regarded subject matter expertise who possesses the high-level, first-hand experience in a globally available web-based application, with an easy access mobile device application crowd-sourced consultancy proprietary collaborative platform that has an established, proven, real-time, crowd-sourcing, proprietary web-based two way multi-directional interactions with Subject Matter Expert (SME) collaboration for providing organizations the ability to understand and interpret complex national security events and trends that allows for correlations and comparisons of the results from different simulations performed in the system to reveal broader and deeper correlations between studies and components of studies to enhance second and third tier conclusions and predictions. The contractor must develop meaningful, well-informed and relevant recommendations that will carry credibility throughout the NDU and DoD. They must be an expert with an in-depth understanding with the functionality of this platform, immediate availability, access and ease of use and the interactive collaborative methodologies that are the core of the system that are critically important to the ULCATS project as it is a requirement to bring together a large and diverse group of geographically dispersed SMEs to collaborate together to achieve the ULCATS study's objectives. More specifically, Wikistrat employs a SME team of over 50 "by name" identified, system-trained Senior analysts who are SMEs on the topic areas to be analyzed by NDU for ULCATS and who will be available to NDU under the contract. The Government believes that the proprietary collaborative platform and SMEs will substantially benefit this effort. The direct and relevant unique experience and features of Wikistrat platform includes:<br />&bull; Proprietary Web-based collaborative platform approach (including mobile device access) that can develop a clear and unbiased understanding that support this highly complex study.<br />&bull; Real-time, immediate results.<br />&bull; Allows for multi-directional participant collaboration and SME customer interaction from a large group of highly qualified that can be analyzed and input in the fastest and most cost effective manner.<br />&bull; Controls for cognitive bias.<br />&bull; Core features of Agility, Innovation, Rapid and Cost-Effective Decision-Making with results that can be immediately available, that offers ease of use (offers mobile apps), and is proven with real time presentations and challenging of numerous thoughts, ideas and facts.<br />&bull; Offers input/participation from a broad array of over 50 system-trained SMEs with expertise relevant to the ULCATs study and relies on a global network of over 2,000 regional and functional specialists to serve as the expert advisory group to the client.</p>
<p>This notice of intent, required by FAR 6.302-1(d)(2), is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation is available for this procurement. Any firm that believes it is equally or otherwise uniquely capable of meeting the requirements described herein may submit a capabilities statement (to include contact information, size status under NAICS 541990, DUNS Number, and CAGE Code) which, if received no later than 4:30 PM Central Time on 29 April 2016, will be considered. Responses to this posting must be submitted in writing via e-mail only to Stanley Stearns, AFICA/KD DTIC IAC Flight at stanley.stearns@us.af.mil. A determination not to compete the described contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Federal Government.</p>
<p>To mitigate the potential for an organizational conflict of interest, Wikistrat Inc., may potentially be restricted from being a prime or a subcontractor on any follow on work involving ULCATs contracts.<br />Contracting Office Address: <br />101 Washington Sq Bldg 40, Rm #163<br />Offutt AFB, Nebraska 68113-2107 <br />United States <br />Primary Point of Contact: <br />Stanley Stearns<br />Contracting Officer<br />stanley.stearns@us.af.mil<br />Phone: 402-294-4711</p>

This notice is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations and a solicitation will not be issued for this requirement. <br /><br />The Army Contracting Command - Redstone Arsenal intends to award a modification to the existing Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) Engineering Services (ES) contract in accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services which will extend the contract period of performance through 30 June 2017. The extension will provide incidental material, maintenance, information management actions necessary to support the TOW ITAS unique assemblies/subassemblies, Field Service Representative (FSR) support and Logistics Support.<br />&nbsp;
<p>This six month extension of services is accomplished pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This six month extension is intended to be awarded to Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS) Company under FAR 6.302-1 as award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement.</p>
<p>While the extension option under FAR 52.217-8 was not evaluated as part of the initial contract award for W31P4Q-07-C-0088, the rates applicable for this extension period are the current FY16 rates specified in the contract, as expressly allowed by FAR 52.217-8. This extension is necessary to allow time for the limited competition acquisition of the follow-on contract.</p>
<p>The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this option to extend services. <br />Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be e-mailed to Michael.r.bell44.civ@mail.mil and dorphelia.b.foster.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education's (Department) mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access to education.
<p>The Department's Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) provides the technological solutions that enable the Department to deliver world-class service to schools, students and their families. To accomplish its mission, OCIO advises and assists the Secretary and other senior officers in acquiring information technology (IT) and managing information resources. OCIO helps these leaders comply with the best practices in the industry and applicable federal laws and regulations, including the Clinger Cohen Act, the Government Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Federal Information Security Management Act. In addition, the agency's Chief Information Officer is charged with establishing a management framework that leads the agency toward more efficient and effective operations, including improved planning and control of IT investments.</p>
<p>On September 27, 2007, the Department replaced its enterprise wide network and IT support services contract, known as the Education Network Contract (EDNET), with the Education Department Utility for Communications, Applications, and Technology Environment (EDUCATE) Contract. EDUCATE is a 10-year performance-based, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract (Base Year, plus 9 Option Periods) that moved the Department from a Government-Owned, Contactor-Operated (GOCO) IT service model to a Contractor-Owned, Contractor-Operated (COCO) managed IT service model. The EDUCATE Contract provides IT resources to all Department employees and contractors - approximately 5,600 users who work in Washington, D.C., 10 regional offices in the Continental U.S. and Puerto Rico, and various satellite offices. The EDUCATE Contractor provides a wide-array of fully-managed services that include: Desktop Services, Helpdesk Support Services, Systems and Data Center Services, E-mail Services, Network, Telecom, Multimedia Services, Disaster Recovery Services, Special Services, and Printer Services. Cross functional service areas (general services) include: Invoicing and Billing, Auditing, Reporting, Planning/Project, Security/Privacy, Records/FOIA, Architecture/Engineering, Assistive Technology and Training.</p>
<p>The Department's Market Research activities to date include an Industry Day in June 2015 that was attended in-person or virtually by interested vendors and the release of two Requests for Information (RFI).</p>
<p>The initial RFI was released with the intention of identifying existing state-of-the art capabilities available in the marketplace; exploring industry vision for innovation and expected rate of change across planned service areas; identifying potential opportunities for cost savings, efficiency and consolidation over the life of the contract; and, soliciting industry feedback on a draft set of business requirements.</p>
<p>The second RFI was to obtain vendor feedback to inform the finalization of the Acquisition Strategy, identify performance measurements that promote user satisfaction on provided services, and support the alignment of business and technical requirements with industry standards.</p>
<p>The Department initially planned to hold a second Industry Day event in late April 2016. However, due to the developed acquisition strategy and associated activities that are required, the Department has elected to hold a Pre-RFP Industry Day on 06 June 2016. Interested parties within the IT community/industry are highly encouraged to attend this event where the Department will provide an overview of the planned acquisition strategy, industry considerations, and, as appropriate, address questions posed by industry in advance of the event. Attendance may occur in-person or virtually. Please see the attached document entitled "Pre-RFP Industry Day Notice FINAL" for additional details regarding this event and how to attend.</p>

<p>Anticipated Issue Date: 22 APR 2016 - Anticipated Closing Date: 10 MAY 2016 - 2:00 PM EDT</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) - The Government is issuing this RFI/Sources Sought announcement as part of market research for TR-333 Hydrophone Receptacle Connectors. These highly specialized connectors s are a piezoelectric part used in the production of TR-333 Hydrophones. See attached drawings 6029162-203 (Sheets 1, 2, 3) and amended Statement of Work to review the technical requirements provided as Attachments 1 and 2 to this document. Vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) and registered in the Joint Certification Program (JCP) in order to receive access to the Statement of Work and Drawings. Information about the JCP is located at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division located at Naval Support Activity, Crane, IN intends to award a sole source contract to the current certified source, Teledyne Instruments, Inc., 162 Corporate Drive, Suite 100, Portsmouth, NH 03801-6815 (CAGE 17476). This effort will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition to the Hydrophone Receptacle Connectors is to avoid roughly $3.7 million in cost duplication and prevent as much as two years unnecessary schedule impact. The program requires critical component suppliers to go through an extensive qualification plan, to include inspection, certification, first article testing, and operational testing. The Government has expended considerable effort and expense to develop the current certified source. The estimated cost to restore capability if a different vendor's Hydrophone Receptacle Connector is procured is projected to be roughly $3.7 million higher than the proposed cost to utilize an existing certified source.</p>
<p>In accordance with Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 206.302-1, the Government is accepting information from companies potentially capable of meeting the requirements as described above. Companies with the capabilities and facilities to provide components that meet the Government's requirement and certification requirements for TR-333 Hydrophone Receptacle Connectors may respond. Responses shall address how the Government can offset the estimated $3.7 million in cost duplication and the schedule delay that are anticipated to result if a new source is utilized.</p>
<p>Responses shall include availability, budgetary cost estimate, and lead time of the solution.</p>
<p>All interested parties may submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than 5 pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, a budgetary estimate of test articles, production units, production quantity breaks, an explanation as to why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole source basis as stated above given the significant Government investment in the existing TR-333 Hydrophone Receptacle Connectors.</p>
<p>Responses to the Market Survey shall include the following:</p>
<p>Submitter's Name<br />Street Address, City, State, Zip Code<br />Business Size<br />Point of Contact (POC)<br />POC Telephone<br />Announcement Number: N00164-16-D-GP20</p>
<p>Please include the purpose/explanation of the response to the Market Survey, i.e. to better understand the Government requirements; to potentially become a viable source for future requirements; to take exception to the anticipated sole source as your company currently meets all of the Government requirements and can successfully offset the projected cost duplication and schedule delays. The Government may contact RFI respondents to get clarification on the information submitted.</p>
<p>Contractors must be properly registered in the Government's System for Award Management (SAM) and in the Joint Certification Program (JCP) in order to receive the attachments. Offerors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220 or via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov. Information about on JCP is located at http://www.dlis.dla.mil.</p>
<p>At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts. This RFI/sources sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.</p>

<SUBJECT>J--Intent to Negotiate on a Sole Source Basis
<SOLNBR>SOL-CI-16-00009
<CONTACT>Lower, Angela
<DESC>The U.S. EPA, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) located in Ann Arbor, Michigan intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with AnD Technology, Inc. (AnD) in order to provide maintenance, spare parts and upgrade services to AnD Technology-supplied vehicle and engine emission test equipment and associated components owned by EPA under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  This requirement will utilize FAR Parts 12 and 13, Commercial and Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  

The contractor shall provide high level expertise in maintaining, repairing, supporting, and upgrading AnD-supplied vehicle and engine emission test equipment and associated components and provide training related to the equipment and components (as needed).  AnD engine emission test controllers and combustion analytical systems are controlled by AnD proprietary software.  This software together with AnD hardware control peripheral equipment to run engine emission tests.  High-level maintenance, repairs and upgrades require access to the source code of the proprietary software above.  There are no authorized independent dealers/distributors of this equipment.  

AnD Technology is the only known source able to satisfy the maintenance requirements, spare parts and upgrades for the AnD Technology-supplied equipment owned by EPA.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing maintenance services of AnD technology equipment may submit technical documentation to establish their capability.  Such documentation must be submitted to the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Angela Lower via email at lower.angela@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored.

SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS
  In accordance with FAR 28.307-2 and FAR 52.228-5, the following minimum coverage shall apply to this contract:
  (a)  Workers' compensation and employers liability:  Contractors are required to comply with applicable Federal and State workers' compensation and occupational disease statutes.  If occupational diseases are not compensable under those statutes, they shall be covered under the employer's liability section of the insurance policy, except when contract operations are so commingled with a Contractor's commercial operations that it would not be practical to require this coverage.  Employer's liability coverage of at least $100,000 is required, except in States with exclusive or monopolistic funds that do not permit workers' compensation to be written by private carriers.
  (b)  General Liability:  per occurrences.
  (c)  Automobile liability:  per person;  per occurrence and  property damage.
  (d)  The successful bidder must present to the Contracting Officer, prior to award, evidence of general liability insurance without any exclusionary clauses for asbestos that would void the general liability coverage.
(End of Clause)

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.</p>

If the Contracting Officer does not conduct a reverse auction, award may be made on the basis of initial offers or following discussions not using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique. If the Contracting Officer decides to use on-line reverse auctioning to conduct price negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify Offerors of this decision and the following provisions will apply:<br /><br />(a) The award decision will be made in accordance with the evaluation factors as set forth in the solicitation. The reverse on-line auction will be used as a pricing technique during discussions to establish the final offered prices from each Offeror. These prices will be used in conjunction with the evaluation factors stated elsewhere in the solicitation in order to make the award decision in accordance with the basis for award stated in the solicitation.<br /><br />(b) Following the decision to conduct discussions using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique, the Contracting Officer or his/her representative will provide Offerors determined to be in the competitive range with information concerning the auction process.<br /><br />(c) Prior to conducting the reverse auction, the Contracting Officer may hold discussions with the Offerors concerning matters appropriate for discussion, such as issues involving technical proposals or unbalanced pricing.<br /><br />(d) Unless auction instructions indicate that only Offeror's rankings will be displayed, the lowest Offeror's price(s) for each round of the reverse auction will be disclosed to other Offerors and anyone else having authorized access to the auction. This disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each Offeror's identity will be concealed from other Offerors (although it will be known to the Government; only a generic identifier will be used for each Offeror's proposed pricing, such as "Offeror A" or "lowest-priced Offeror").&nbsp; By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, Offerors agree to participate in the reverse auction and that their prices may be disclosed, including to other Offerors, during the reverse auction.<br /><br />(e) An Offeror's final auction price at the close of the reverse auction will be considered its final price proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer<br />decides that further discussions are needed and final price proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.307, or the Contracting Officer determines that it would be in the best interest of the Government to re-open the auction.<br /><br />(f) The following requirements apply when the Government uses a commercial web-based product to conduct the reverse auction:<br /><br />(1) Each Offeror identified by the Contracting Officer as a participant in the reverse auction will be contacted by Defense Logistic Agency's commercial reverse auction service provider to advise the Offeror of the event and to provide an explanation of the process.<br /><br />(2) In order for an Offeror to participate in the reverse auction, such Offeror must agree with terms and conditions of the entire solicitation, including this provision, and agree to the commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions for using its service. Information concerning the reverse auction process and the commercial service provider's terms and conditions is embedded within the email notification sent by the on-line reverse auction pricing tool system administrator.<br /><br />(3) Offerors shall secure the passwords and other confidential materials provided by the commercial reverse auction service provider or the Government and ensure they are used only for purposes of participation in the reverse auction. Offerors shall keep their own and other Offeror's pricing in confidence until after contract award.<br /><br />(4) The reverse auction system currently in use designates offers as "Lead," meaning the current low price in that auction, or "Not Lead," meaning not the current low price in that auction. In the event of a tie offer, the reverse auction provider's system designates the first offer of that price as "Lead" and the second or subsequent offer of that price as "Not Lead." Offerors shall not submit a tie offer, since this is inconsistent with the purpose of the reverse auction. If a tie offer is submitted and no evaluation factors other than price were identified in the<br />solicitation, the "Not Lead" Offeror that submitted the tie offer must offer a changed price; otherwise its offer will be ineligible for award if their final price in the auction is the tie offer price. If evaluation factors in addition to price<br />were listed in the solicitation, tie offers that are "Not Lead" will be considered and evaluated in accordance with those evaluation factors.<br /><br />(5) Any Offerors unable to enter pricing through the commercial reverse auction service provider's system during a reverse auction must notify the Contracting Officer or designated representative immediately. The Contracting Officer may, at his/her sole discretion, extend or re-open the reverse auction if the reason for the Offeror's inability to enter pricing is determined to be without fault on the part of the Offeror and outside the Offeror's control.<br /><br />(6) The reverse auction will be conducted using the commercial reverse auction service provider's website as embedded in the email notification. Offerors shall be responsible for providing their own computer and internet connection.<br /><br />(7) Training:<br /><br />(i) The commercial reverse auction service provider and/or a Government representative will provide familiarization training to Offerors' employees; this training may be provided through written material, the commercial reverse auction service provider's website, and/or other means.<br /><br />(ii) An employee of an Offeror who successfully completes the training shall be designated as a "Trained Offeror." Only Trained Offerors may participate in a reverse auction. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to request that Offerors provide an alternate Offeror employee to become a Trained Offeror. The Contracting Officer also reserves the right to take away the Trained Offeror's designation from any Trained Offeror who fails to abide by the solicitation's or commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions.<br /><br />(End of provision)<br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS:<br />Submit quotes by email (preferred) to: Nicholas.Moore@dla.mil no later than April 29, 2016 at 11:59 P.M.

Only those vendors on the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) ME-1409-24_Casting_Splints are eligible for participation. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></strong><br />These Casting Splints products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this Sources Sought Notification is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at <a href="https://www.medical.dla.mil/">https://www.medical.dla.mil/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />This Sources Sought Notification is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL ME-1409-24_Casting_Splints.

Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection, with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is&nbsp;May 2016. Among vendors who are on QSL) ME-1409-24_Casting_Splints, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Casting Splints.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Casting Splints. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $586,412 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period. The usage data represents requirements for the Army, Navy, and Air Force Institutional MTFs, along with operational assemblages in the Department of Defense (DoD). The specifications for this project are shown in Requirements below. <br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors on QSL) ME-1409-24_Casting_Splints who are interested in participating in the Standardization Action for an IA must provide a response to this Sources Sought Notification via e-mail to the MMESO POCs below.</strong> In addition to the offered pricing as specified, please include the following information: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding.

Source Selection Procedures <br />Pricing analysis of required items will occur for those vendors who have been previously qualified for the QSL. Price will be evaluated based on unit price multiplied by number of estimated units. Best overall price will be the determining factor in vendor selection for an Incentive Agreement for Standardization.

Where lower base uncommitted government prices are available, such as Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices, incentive tier is expected to be lower than such prices. This is because DAPAs, unlike other government prices, are base uncommitted. A vendor shall not quote base uncommitted prices such as FSS prices as the discounted tier price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendor must provide quotes on items provided in response to the technical/company requirements. Based on the good faith volume estimates provided, vendor agrees to give all designated MTFs and Operational Units incentive pricing throughout the life of this agreement in exchange for 80% commitment of purchases for the MHS in this product line. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA in response to the IA FBO will not be considered for continued participation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Points of Contact (POCs):</span> <br />Mr. Thomas Winkel, MMESO Europe Team Leader, thomas.p.winkel.ctr@mail.mil, 011-49-6371-9464-4089; and Mr. Robert Halliday, PA, MS, MMESO Europe Clinical Analyst, robert.b.halliday2.ctr@mail.mil, 011-49-6371-86-5446.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The making of instrumentation (e.g. load cells, accelerometers, angular rate sensors necessary, etc.) to record measurements within Anthropomorphic Test Devices (ATD) is a highly technical specialized endeavor with a very limited number of suppliers. The InfraRed - Telescoping Rod for Assessment of Chest Compression (IR-TRACC) is either a standalone 1-dimensional device, 2-D device or 3-D device.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 3-D IR-TRACC used in the THOR-50M ATD measures deflections of the thorax and abdomen via measuring linear displacement from front-to-back utilizing telescoping tubes and rotation about two orthogonal axes at the rear pivot of the assembly. The combination of these three measurements provides the three dimensional motion of the front attachment point of the instrument relative to its anchor point along the ATD's spine. The repair lead time for damage incurred by a lack of reliable durability on the 3-D IR-TRACCs for the THOR-50M has historically been a source of inconvenience and delay in testing. Because of concerns regarding availability and durability, NHTSA intends to evaluate alternatives to the 3-D IR-TRACCs. The procurement and evaluation of alternatives will support NHTSA research programs.</span></p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.<br /><br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-87.<br /><br />The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services. The small business size standard is $15.0M. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small businesses. Simplified acquisition procedures will be utilized.<br /><br /><strong><em>Background Information</em></strong><br /><br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Information Technology Laboratory's (ITL) Information Access Division's Retrieval Group works with industry, academia and other government agencies to promote the use of more effective and efficient techniques for manipulating information not specifically structured for automatic use--especially the browsing, searching, and presentation of that information. Accurate evaluation of the capabilities of current information access systems is a prerequisite to improving the systems' capabilities. Human-created annotations are essential to the evaluation of information systems. Over the years, these evaluations have helped dramatically improve the overall state-of-the-art in information retrieval systems.<br /><br />The work of the Retrieval Group includes the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC).  One of the main goals of TREC is to promote research in information retrieval (IR) by providing appropriate test collections. IR test collections consist of three parts: a set of documents, a set of information needs called "topics" that can be answered by some of the documents in the document set, and a set of relevance assessments that lists for each topic the set of documents that are relevant to that topic.<br /><br />The Clinical Decision Support Track of the TREC was developed to support research on finding clinically relevant information within the medical literature.  Track participants use their retrieval systems to find articles from the biomedical literature that answer one of three clinically-important questions (What is the diagnosis? What test is needed? What treatment should be started?) for each of a set of 30 case studies summarizing a (hypothetical) patient's condition.<br /><br /><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reference attachments for complete combined synopsis/solicitation.&nbsp;</span></em></strong>

<p>2. Contractors are requested to submit a written technical and price quotation in response to the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS) and Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP). Quotations should be prepared in accordance with (IAW) the RFQ and all applicable clauses and provisions. Further information on submission of technical and price quotations is provided throughout this document.</p>
<p>IAW with DISA Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DARS) 52.209-9000, each contractor shall specifically identify in its quotation, whether or not any potential or actual Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest (OCCI) as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5 exists for this this procurement. If the contractor believes that no OCCI exists, the OCCI response shall set forth sufficient details to support such a position. If a contractor believes that an actual or perceived OCCI does exist on this procurement, the contractor shall submit an OCCI plan with the quotation, explaining in detail how the OCCI will be mitigated and/or avoided.</p>
<p>3. Evaluation Factors and Basis for Award Determination:</p>
<p>a. Award will be made to the contractor whose quotation is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government using an LPTA evaluation process. Quotations will be evaluated with regard to how they respond to the requirements of the PWS and on price submissions. The technical portion of the quotation should include all information the contractor wants the Government to consider and evaluate regarding its company's ability to perform all required tasks and conform to all required terms and conditions. In order to be eligible for award, the contractor's quotation must sufficiently address all aspects of the PWS. The Government reserves the right, but is not obligated, to conduct a realism analysis. With regard to the best value analysis for the award decision, the below evaluation factors and subfactors will be used in the determination of technical acceptability. Section 508 Accessibility Standards do not apply to this requirement.</p>
<p>b. After receipt of quotations, the Government will first evaluate the lowest price quotation. If the lowest price quotation is determined to be technically acceptable and otherwise properly awardable, no further evaluations will be conducted, and award will be made. If, however, the lowest price quotation is determined to be technically unacceptable and/or otherwise not properly awardable, further evaluations will be conducted.</p>
<p>c. The standards for determining technical acceptability are below, as well as information concerning price quotations. Page limitations are identified below under each evaluation factor and will be treated as maximums. If exceeded, excess pages will not be read or considered in evaluation of the quotation. The following items will not be considered when calculating page limits: cover page, table of contents, glossary, executive summary, generic resumes, past performances, OCCI mitigation plans, and Section 508 compliance. In the event any evaluation notices are issued, page limitations may also be placed on those. The technical portion of the quotation is to be submitted as a Microsoft (MS) Word 2007 or PDF document. The page format shall have a 1 inch margin using no smaller than an 11 point Ariel, Times New Roman, or Courier New font for all text to include any text contained in a table. The price quotation spreadsheet shall be a separate document from the technical quotation and shall be submitted in MSExcel 2007 format. All formulas shall remain present in the spreadsheet for verification. The file size of each document shall not exceed 2MB. Page limitations shall not be circumvented by including inserted text boxes/pop-ups or internet links to additional information; such inclusions are not acceptable and will not be considered part of a quotation. The Government reserves the right not to consider for award any quotation that does not adhere to the administrative requirements of this RFQ.</p>
<p>(1) Technical/Management Approach Factor: The Technical/Management Subfactors will be evaluated and rated either Acceptable or Unacceptable. In order for a quotation to be rated overall Technically Acceptable, each of the following subfactors must be rated Acceptable. Technical/ management quotations should not exceed 20 pages.</p>
<p>(a) Subfactor 1: Relocation and moving of DISA equipment, workstations/office boxes, IT boxes, plus storage type boxes and related items listed under tasks 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3.  Vendor will show in writing that they can meet the move requirements both by the amount to be moved each day and the time requirements that each task must be completed by.  This can be done by<br />providing the number of workers they plan on using to meet the move requirements for each task/subtask.</p>
<p>(b) Subfactor 2: Packaging Material.  Vendor will provide a detailed list of the quantity, size, and type of boxes, and other packaging materials (e.g., bubble wrap, tape, etc.) as described in task 6.4.  Quantity and size of materials must meet minimum requirements listed in 6.4.1 and 6.4.2.</p>
<p>(c) Subfactor 3: Optional Work.  System Furniture tear down at Green Mount Facility.  Items and furniture to be removed from Green Mount facility, if needed.  Vendor will show in writing that they can meet the move requirements (amount to be moved and time requirements) listed in task 6.5, if optional work is required.</p>
<p>(d) Subfactor 4: Low Profile Turn Table: The Offeror will provide a manufacturer description of the offered product that demonstrates the product characteristics and meets all the requirements of the PWS section 13.</p>
<p>(2) Price Factor:</p>
<p>(a) Price quotations will be evaluated to determine if they are reasonable and complete. The contractor shall submit pricing for the base period and all option periods, including option pricing for an additional 6-month period that may be authorized IAW FAR 52.217-8. See FAR 52.217-8 which authorizes the Government to require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. The pricing quotation should include a separate line item for the additional 6-month period IAW FAR 52.217-8. These prices shall be identical to the quoted pricing in the 6 months prior to expiration of the base period, or the final option period, if option periods are present. The total evaluated price will consist of the contractor's proposed price for the base period, all option periods, the option pricing for the additional 6-month period, and surge pricing as requested below.</p>
<p>(b) Contractors should ensure price quotations include detailed information regarding the resources required to accomplish the task (e.g., labor categories, labor hours, number of employees for each labor category, rates, travel, incidental equipment, contract access fees, etc.). Labor categories and labor rates identified in your price quotation. Any labor rates/categories proposed as a substitute for any required categories must be on a one for one basis. Again, the price quotation spreadsheet shall be a separate document from the technical/management quotation. The Government is requesting any and all discounts to the labor rates and material pricing.</p>
<p>(c) All travel must show the specific detail, if known (e.g., number of days, locations, number of personnel, etc.). All ODCs shall annotate the specific detail (e.g., quantity, part number, manufacturer, etc.) to include supporting documentation to justify the costs (i.e., price quotes, price history, etc.). Travel shall be authorized by the COR in writing prior to performance and will be paid IAW FAR Part 31.205-46.</p>
<p>4. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without exchanges with offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct exchanges or seek clarifications if the contracting officer (KO) determines they are necessary. The Government further reserves the right to reduce the number of quotations being competitively considered to the greatest number that will permit efficient competition among the most highly rated quotations. If a contractor's quotation is removed from further consideration for award, written notice of the removal will be provided to the contractor. In the event issues pertaining to a proposed task cannot be resolved to the KO's satisfaction, the Government reserves the right to withdraw and cancel the proposed order. In such event, contractors will be notified in writing.</p>
<p>6. The SF 1449 contains provisions that apply to this solicitation and clauses that will be applicable to the resulting award. Some of the provisions require a response from the contractor and will need to be submitted along with your quotation.</p>
<p>7. In response to this RFQ, no terms, conditions, or assumptions will be entertained. If terms, conditions, or assumptions are included in a quotation, the quotation may be excluded on grounds that it failed to comply with the RFQ's instructions.</p>
<p>8. All quotations received in response to this RFQ shall remain valid for 90 calendar days from the date of receipt of quotations. Further, should the contractor be awarded this contract, the contractor will furnish the items and/or services identified in its quotation at the price quoted.</p>
<p>9. Site Visit will be conducted beginning at Thursday <strong>May 5, 2016 at 10:00am (CT).</strong> The Site visit will begin at DISA CONUS, Building 5160, 5534 Pryor Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225 and will then progress through all site locations on Scott AFB to conclude at DISA DECC St. Louis 34300 Goodfellow Blvd. St Louis, MO 63102.</p>

<p><br />&emsp;<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><strong>Introduction </strong><br />The objectives of the DoD SBIR Program include stimulating technological innovation in DoD's Science and Technology Emphasis Areas, strengthening the role of small business in meeting DoD research and development needs, fostering and encouraging participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation, and increasing the commercial application of DoD-supported research or research and development results.
<p><strong><br />Three Phase Program</strong><br />The SBIR Program is a three-phase program.</p>
<p>Phase I is to determine, to the extent possible, the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of ideas submitted under the SBIR Program. Phase I awards are typically $70,000 to $150,000 in size, and the period of performance is generally from six to twelve months. Proposals should concentrate on research or research and development which will significantly contribute to proving the scientific and technical feasibility, and commercialization potential of the proposed effort, the successful completion of which is a prerequisite for further DoD support in Phase II. Proposers are encouraged to consider whether the research or research and development being proposed to DoD Components also has private sector potential, either for the proposed application or as a base for other applications.</p>
<p>Phase II awards will be made to firms on the basis of results of their Phase I effort and the scientific merit, technical merit, and commercialization potential of the Phase II proposal. Phase II awards are typically $500,000 to $1,000,000 in size and the period of performance is generally 24 months. Phase II is the principal research or research and development effort and is expected to produce a well-defined deliverable prototype. A Phase II contractor may receive up to one additional, sequential Phase II award for continued work on the project.</p>
<p>Under Phase III, the Proposer is required to obtain funding from either the private sector, a non-SBIR Government source, or both, to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&amp;D service for sale in military or private sector markets. SBIR Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior SBIR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the SBIR Program. Phase III work is typically oriented towards commercialization of SBIR research or technology.</p>

<DESC><strong>Introduction </strong><br />The objectives of the DoD STTR Program include stimulating technological innovation in DoD's Science and Technology Emphasis Areas, strengthening the role of small business in meeting DoD research and development needs, fostering and encouraging participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation, and increasing the commercial application of DoD-supported research or research and development results.<br />
<p><strong><br />Three Phase Program</strong><br />The STTR Program is a three-phase program.</p>
<p>Phase I is to determine, to the extent possible, the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and feasibility of ideas submitted under the STTR Program. Phase I awards are typically $70,000 to $150,000 in size, and the period of performance is generally from six to twelve months. Proposals should concentrate on research or research and development which will significantly contribute to proving the scientific and technical feasibility, and commercialization potential of the proposed effort, the successful completion of which is a prerequisite for further DoD support in Phase II. Proposers are encouraged to consider whether the research or research and development being proposed to DoD Components also has private sector potential, either for the proposed application or as a base for other applications.</p>
<p>Phase II awards will be made to firms on the basis of results of their Phase I effort and the scientific merit, technical merit, and commercialization potential of the Phase II proposal. Phase II awards are typically $500,000 to $1,000,000 in size and the period of performance is generally 24 months. Phase II is the principal research or research and development effort and is expected to produce a well-defined deliverable prototype. A Phase II contractor may receive up to one additional, sequential Phase II award for continued work on the project.</p>
<p>Under Phase III, the Proposer is required to obtain funding from either the private sector, a non-STTR Government source, or both, to develop the prototype into a viable product or non-R&amp;D service for sale in military or private sector markets. STTR Phase III refers to work that derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under prior STTR funding agreements, but is funded by sources other than the STTR Program. Phase III work is typically oriented towards commercialization of STTR research or technology.</p>
<p><strong>STTR Preface Instructions and Solicitation Website<br /></strong>WEBLINK for this DoD STTR Solicitation is: <a href="https://sbir.defensebusiness.org">https://sbir.defensebusiness.org</a> &nbsp;<br />Offerors assume the risk of website inaccessibility due to heavy usage in the final hours before the solicitation closing time, therefore, plan ahead and submit early.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <BR> <BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <BR> <BR>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.) <BR> <BR>__ (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. __ (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ? 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <BR> <BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <BR> <BR>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ? 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ? 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <BR> <BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <BR> <BR>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

Vendor Questions and Responses
Question:

* Do we need to bid on all parts of the bid including delivery, installation, and training?  Or can we bid only on the supply of the fire extinguishing equipment?   

Response:  For your offer to be considered you must quote all line items.

From Section A. Supplemental Information to Offerors

15.          Proposal Total Firm Fixed Price:
                15.1        Offers shall include a Total Firm Fixed Price for CLINs 0001-0007 for the items listed in this procurement. 

20.5  The Price/Cost Schedule listed in Section B.1 of this solicitation shall be used by prospective contractors to submit pricing and cost data for the items requested in this solicitation.

23.          ACCEPTABLE OFFERS:  One single contract will be made as a result of this solicitation. For an offer to be considered for a potential contractual award the contractor must provide all CLIN items listed in this solicitation. Contract award shall be made on an ALL OR NONE BASIS by the contracting officer. Partial offers that do not address, provide, and/or quote all CLIN items shall be deemed not technically acceptable and shall be rejected. Offers must clearly indicate if brand name items are being furnished or if or equivalent, brand name or equal, alternate, or substitute products are being provided.

Question:

* Also, if we do complete the installation,  is this a one time set up or will we be expected to complete annual services on the equipment?

Response:

Installation will be a one-time set up to outfit the Concourse, Staff Garage, and D&T Building with fire extinguishers. Annual or continuing services for this requirement are not being requested at this time. A separate solicitation for annual or continuing services may be done at a future time (i.e a solicitation for a services contract). The contractor is responsible for the initial annual inspection but not for inspections that follow. 

From Section A. Supplemental Information to Offerors

5.         Contract Type and Period of Performance:
            5.1       Upon award, contract will be a Firm Fixed Price contract.  The contract will consist of Contract Line Items (CLINs) for supply/equipment, delivery, installation, inspection, and training.
5.2       The anticipated Period of Performance for delivery and installation is July 1st, 2016.  

From Statement of Work

2.         SCOPE

2.1       The Contractor shall provide, transport, install, and complete the initial annual inspection of all listed equipment.  All products must meet all salient characteristics defined in this section.

Question:

Will the fire extinguishers be in cabinets or mounted directly to the wall?

Response:

The floor plans and drawings for the building do not specify whether the fire extinguishers will go in a cabinet or on the wall. It is going to be a combination of both. The general, clinical, and administrative areas will have mostly have cabinets; while, hazardous and mechanical spaces will need them mostly mounted on the wall. Contractors should come prepared with tools to mount some of the extinguishers on dry wall and concrete. There will not be any drilling though metal of any sort.

<DESC>This notice is a synopsis in accordance with FAR 5.101 for a proposed contract action to Contract W31P4Q-07-C-0088 published at least 15 days before the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations and a solicitation will not be issued for this requirement. <br /><br />The Army Contracting Command - Redstone Arsenal intends to award a modification to the existing Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) Engineering Services (ES) contract in accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services which will extend the contract period of performance through 30 June 2017. The extension will provide incidental material, maintenance, information management actions necessary to support the TOW ITAS unique assemblies/subassemblies, Field Service Representative (FSR) support and Logistics Support.<br />&nbsp;
<p>This six month extension of services is accomplished pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This six month extension is intended to be awarded to Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS) Company under FAR 6.302-1 as award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirement.</p>
<p>While the extension option under FAR 52.217-8 was not evaluated as part of the initial contract award for W31P4Q-07-C-0088, the rates applicable for this extension period are the current FY16 rates specified in the contract, as expressly allowed by FAR 52.217-8. This extension is necessary to allow time for the&nbsp;sole source&nbsp;acquisition of the follow-on contract.</p>
<p>The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this option to extend services. <br />Written comments or questions regarding this notice must be e-mailed to Michael.r.bell44.civ@mail.mil and dorphelia.b.foster.civ@mail.mil.</p>

1.0  Introduction
This Draft Screening Information Request (D-SIR) and Request for Information (RFI) and comments announcement is issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1. 
This announcement provides the opportunity for industry to offer FAA comments on the draft acquisition package (D-SIR) and supporting system specification documentation (SSD) for the Aerospace Medicine Safety Information System (AMSIS).  The purpose of this Draft SIR (D-SIR) is to: 

1.	Allow industry the opportunity to review and provide input on the planned Aerospace Medicine Safety Information System (AMSIS) Final Screening Information Request (SIR).  This is an effort to promote continual open communications with industry in the hopes of improving the quality of the Final SIR;

2.	Provide additional information about AMSIS system required functionality to industry and request comments from interested companies about capabilities, performance, and technical requirements provided with the D-SIR;

3.	Seek and identify industry interest in the program;

4.	Collect industry comments on the statement of work, proposed contract types/structure, key deliverables, and system specifications to further shape and define AMSIS in support of a successful Final Investment Decision (FID) and subsequent procurement; and,

5.	Inform the industry that the AMSIS Program Management Office may be releasing a Final SIR/Request for Offers (RFO) in the near future. 


The AMSIS program is now in the final investment analysis phase that includes plans for the system procurement and final investment decision in FY2017.  The results of the D-SIR industry comments will serve as a tool for FAA to determine the final acquisition approach and AMSIS system requirements.  The D-SIR and any subsequent Final SIR will provide for a contract to deliver Segment 1 of the AMSIS program capabilities identified in the SIR package provided with this announcement.  A potential future contract option, based upon successful performance and delivery of Segment 1, may result in an award for the delivery of additional requirements to be developed and implemented as enhancements to AMSIS as Segment 2.

2.0 Background

The FAA Office of Aerospace Medicine (AAM) is responsible for a broad range of medical programs and services for both the domestic and international aviation communities.  AAM is responsible for advancing the field of study of aerospace medicine and for the medical certification programs and medical surveillance of airmen, Air Traffic Control Specialists (ATCS), and other safety critical personnel.  The AAM Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI) maintains millions of individual records on over 450,000 medical certifications conducted each year as part of AAMs role in the oversight of three quarters of a million airmen and nearly 17,000 ATCs.  CAMI records include approximately 18,000,000 past medical examinations for airmen and ATCS.  The surveillance program for the Drug Abatement Division (AAM-800) oversees over 8,097 certificated entities.  The Department of Transportation (DOT) administered Internal Substance Abuse Program (ISAP) oversees all FAA employees through random drug testing. The Aviation Medical Examiner (AME) program surveys approximately 4,250 AMEs both domestically and internationally.  AAM has designed, developed and implemented information systems to efficiently process and manage safety, health and research information collected by FAAs regulatory programs. 

AAM will use the AMSIS to develop a new information system for tracking and analyzing a broad selection of medical information associated with pilots, air traffic controllers and other aviation-related personnel.  The AMSIS Program will provide AAM with a system that fully supports the following five AAM core safety initiatives:
	Medical Certification of Airmen;
	Medical Clearance of ATCS; 
	Oversight and management of the Aviation Industry Substance Abuse Program;
	Internal Substance Abuse Program; and,
	Aerospace Medical Research.

The AMSIS program office (AJM-2343) is responsible for preparing and executing the investment analysis, acquisition planning, final investment decision and procurement of the system.  The request for information will assist the program leadership team with final definition of requirements, scope, contract type and structure and development of a solicitation package.

3.0 Description

AMSIS will provide an aerospace medical information network that integrates critical medical information from geographically distributed locations both nationally and internationally. 
The successful AMSIS contractor will assist the FAA program office to design and develop new information systems architecture, and design, develop and deploy a next generation information system.  The program objectives include providing tools necessary for AAM to analyze information to make risk-based policy decisions through using an automated method of collecting, reviewing, and analyzing medical information for Airmen and ATCS.
This system must ensure real time and comprehensive access to data, thereby improving timeliness and accuracy while reducing paper-based correspondence.  It must also enable collaboration within the aviation community, both domestic and international, as well as among personnel, designees, and applicants.  Data must be secured and remain easily accessible, while facilitating management and workforce decision making, thereby providing the basis for a proactive safety approach with improved productivity.
AMSIS will provide better data accessibility and a greater ability to analyze medical information and denial data to identify safety trends that could impact system safety.  Specifically, AMSIS is intended to reduce accidents and improve safety by: 

	Reducing falsification of health records and preventing pilots or ATCs from operating in the NAS when they have medical conditions hazardous to aviation safety; 

	Improving the ability to analyze medical data and identify and mitigate hazards related to specific and/or systemic airmen and ATCs health issues; 

	Improving the ability to match airmen and ATCs medical records with the electronic health records of other government agencies and departments; 
	Ensuring the accuracy and integrity of airmen and ATCs medical data; 
	Leveraging the National Health Information Network (NHIN), Health Information Exchange (HIE) system medical records, and Ad Hoc, Regional, Multi-Regional HIEs, to improve the accuracy of airmen and ATCS medical data; and,
 
	Improving the surveillance and oversight of designees and aviation industry substance abuse programs. 

The AMSIS solution will be hosted using FAA-provided information system and communications infrastructure, such as secure administrative data networks in place now and those being implemented as part of future FAA information technology (IT) enterprise upgrades and programs.  The technical alternatives analysis conducted as part of previous market survey responses determined that the AMSIS solution will be a hybrid of both commercial off the shelf (COTS), enhancements to existing FAA/government-owned systems, and custom software development of specific applications.  The AMSIS is envisioned to be provided using a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) design approach and implemented with a hybrid agile/waterfall solution delivery strategy.

This D-SIR/RFI, inclusive of the attachments, is intended to: 
(1) assist industry in providing inputs, comments, and insights to FAA to refine AMSIS acquisition package, and,

(2) provide industry with the opportunity to comment on initial requirements, implementation strategies, and contracting alternatives prior to release of the Final SIR later this year.  The program office welcomes innovative ideas and solutions to best deliver the AMSIS system to support the various FAA and community user organizations needs.

4.0 Nature of the Competition.  

This is a full and open competition.

5.0 Notifications 

The Draft SIR does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of any proposal or in making necessary studies or designs for the preparation thereof or to acquire or contract for any services.

8.0 Industry Comments Requested
Industry responses may consist of both questions and or comments pertaining to the Draft SIR and its attachments.  

The FAA requests that a Matrix format be used.  The matrix will allow for traceability to the key area(s), reducing any confusion or misunderstandings.

Matrix forms are provided as attachments to this announcement for industry submission of D-SIR comments.
In addition to the matrix of comments on the materials, the FAA is seeking comments relating to specific topics or elements in the D-SIR package.  Industry is asked to provide, using an MS Word document response, feedback or comments on the following general topics as related to the SIR materials, specifically the Statement of Work and specific SIR Sections noted below.

A. SIR Section H/General SOW: FAA is contemplating requiring the Contractor to provide (purchase) upon contract award development licenses for COTS solutions included in their design approach and not included in the FAAs IT Standard.  The FAA requests Industry input and discussion about whether the SIR package and resulting proposals should include contractor purchase of these license(s) or FAA purchase of the license(s) until the products are included in the IT standard.  The response should address considerations, preferences, and recommendations, along with associated tradeoffs, risks, and/or opportunities.

B. SIR Section H/General SOW: Warranty.  FAA is interested in comments related to warranty terms for Segment 1 software and what factors influence Contractor warranty for hybrid solution based upon COTS-GP COTS-special software development items.

C. SIR Section B/Contract CLIN Structure, Section F Deliveries and Performance:  Contract types include Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIP).  Responses should discuss any proposed changes to the contract type and provide rationale for any recommended changes.  For FPIF CLINs (software development and training), provide basis of award considerations that would provide a true/meaningful incentive for schedule, cost or technical performance.  Identify any CDRLs or CLINs that might be modified and provide rationale.

D. SIR Section C, SOW, Implementation (and Associated Section B, & M), Section 6.3.2, AMSIS Maintenance Concept. For Final SIR, the FAA will require vendors to submit pricing to provide all maintenance support (Tier 1, 2 & 3).  Industry comments are requested to assist the FAA in further defining the Contractor role in the provision of Tier 1 & 2 Support Services.  In addition, considerations related to specific work statement language and tradeoffs associated with providing maintenance support for AMSIS Segment 1, and any tie in considerations related to ongoing maintenance if a future contract modification to add Segment 2 requirements to the contract were issued. 
 
E. SIR Section C, SOW, Section 4.3, Software Design.  FAA is interested in industry comments related to incorporating Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) design as a specific requirement for Contractor performance and any recommendations as to how this, if required specifically in the SOW, impacts the software design and development.  FAA is considering providing SOA and related information and/or requirements as a guidance document versus including specifically in the SOW.  Comments are requested regarding the tradeoffs between specific SOW requirements mandating SOA versus providing guidance and how this would affect vendor solutions and proposals.

F. SIR Section C, SOW, Section 5.7, Test.  Discussion about hybrid agile/waterfall and/or agile only approach to development and how these two approaches align with the current requirements for test activities, specific changes to the SOW that might be required to allow flexibility needed to align with development approach, ensure testing and comply with overall requirements to transition the AMSIS from development/test environment into operational pre-production and production environment.

G. SIR Section C, SOW, Section 7.2, Test Support System.  Currently, the program office is requiring only a single AMSIS operational system.  FAA is considering a requirement that the Contractor provide and maintain a second system dedicated to testing, maintenance (to support contract options), and to support possible future Segment 2 work.  AMSIS program office encourages industry to offer comments/recommendations regarding the costs/benefits related to any program requirement for the Contractor to provide a test support system in addition to the AMSIS operational system, to be established and maintained in the development environment.  The response should specifically address the costs, risks and tradeoffs of the Contractor providing the system versus the FAA providing such a system.
 
H. SIR Section C, SOW, Section 8.4, FAA-Provided Training Network (FCS, FTI, other cloud/web based resource).  FAA is seeking industry inputs to determine a future requirement for the provision of AMSIS training using the FAA Cloud Services (FCS) capability and or design features that would provide for a centralized training server and portal.   Any Contractor use of the FAA Cloud Services network for training delivery using, for example, a centralized training server accessible via the FCS wireless/mobile services provided from the FCS must exclude any personally identifiable information (PII) and/or Personal Health Information (PHI) data.  The FCS will not be used for AMSIS, but could be part of a design and solution to support non-operational activities, such as training, where the use of PII and/or PHI is not required.

I. SIR Section J-25, Labor Categories & Minimum Qualifications.   FAA is seeking Industry insight into the required labor categories and minimum qualifications for each.  Please make any suggestions with reasoning associated with proposed changes from what has been provided. 
Attachment J-2, Draft AMSIS System Specification Documentation, (Volume I & II).  FAA is particularly interested in comments on the system specification, in view of industry requests to provide the specification from comments received during market survey and vendor interviews conducted last summer.  To this end, the FAA has extended the comment period an additional 2 weeks (June 8, 2016) to allow time for review and comment and requests the interested vendors submit comments using the comment matrix provided (Attachment #4 to this announcement).

<SOLNBR>AG-0343-S-16-0030
<NTYPE>PRESOL
<RESPDATE>050216
<CONTACT>Karen Ruklic, Phone 208-983-5144, Fax 208-983-4098, Email kruklic@fs.fed.us
<DESC>This project is being done in collaboration with the Nez Perce Tribe Watershed program. The goal of this partnership is to use restoration techniques to improve waterways. This contract requires data collection and analysis; preparation of design drawings, specifications, cost estimates and supporting documentation; and related work in compliance with its terms, specifications and provisions. This includes the furnishing of all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, operating supplies and incidentals (except those designated as Government-furnished).<br /><br />The overall objective is to re-design the previously delineated Stream Reach 2 of Upper Newsome Creek to accommodate for the valley-wide restored floodplain and increased budget.&nbsp; New work elements for the Stream Reach 2 design shall be prioritized as follows: <br /><br />1. New Channel and/or new channel meander construction. Woody debris structures and grade control structures associated with new channel meanders will also be added to the design. <br />2. New habitat improvement structures (design similar in nature to what was implemented in stream Reaches 5, 4, and 3).
<p>The design should achieve the following goals while balancing objectives, costs, and benefits.</p>
<p>1) Improve channel morphology &amp; stream function utilizing as much of the restored valley bottom and floodplain as feasible within Stream Reach 2.<br />2) Increase fish habitat within Stream Reach 2 primarily through the use of stream habitat features (pools, riffles, glides, ect.) and large woody debris.</p>
<p>Background: Full restoration of Stream Reaches 5, 4, and 3 was implemented in 2011 - 2014. These completed reaches and floodplain restoration work are to be used as reference for the design for Stream Reach 2. The large woody debris "system" used on previous reaches should be referenced and carried through Reach 2.</p>
<p>In 2014 and 2015, dredge piles were removed from the Reach 2 floodplain to re-establish the floodplain elevation. The dredge material was placed in repositories at the toe of the hillslopes. In addition, topsoil was salvaged and placed in stockpiles. However, the Newsome Creek through Reach 2 is still in its impacted, straightened channel and lacks structure for fish habitat. <br /><br />Location: The project is approximately 38 mi east of Grangeville, Idaho. At the junction of Highway 14 and the Newsome Cr Road (FR 1858), travel north for approximately 7.0 miles to the gate on the access route developed in 2011. The project BOP is approximately 1.8 miles on an unimproved access route beyond this gate. Access route grades range from 0% - 20%. Maximum grade of 20% is maintained for 0.25 miles descending off ridge to valley bottom. The project is located in T30N, R7E Section 19 and can be reached by automobile (Highway 14 and FR 1858) and high clearance vehicles or 4WD ATV (access route). Access on the 1.8 mile unimproved route is limited to foot travel prior to contract award and until snow free. Project area is typically snow covered from November-June.</p>
<p>Timing: The solicitation will be issued in April 2016 with contract award anticipated to occur on or around May 15, 2016. Deadline for final designs documents: November 15, 2016.<br /><br />Presolicitation was amended on 3/18/16 to remove design requirements related to currently procured planting stock and topsoil&nbsp;stockpiles from the solicitation.&nbsp; This work&nbsp;shall be done in-house to save costs.&nbsp;<br /><br />Solicitation issued 4/12/16.&nbsp; Please take note that a pre-bid conference as been scheduled for 4/19/16.&nbsp; See page 6 of the solicitation for details.<br /><br />Pre-bid conference was held on 4/19/16.&nbsp; Comprehensive notes, power point presentation and scanned plan sheet from Feasibility Study have been uploaded.&nbsp; A solicitation amendment shall be issued by COB Tuesday 4/26/16&nbsp;to add a few clarifying details to the specifications and allow for email submission of quotes.</p>

<CONTACT>Wilson, Mary
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY for market research purposes to identify interested vendors for the potential requirement detailed below. A formal solicitation and performance work statement are not available. Additionally, in accordance with FAR 19.5, Set-Asides for Small Business, the Government will review the information requested in this announcement to determine the type of set-aside (if any) for this requirement, should it come to fruition.

This requirement is for analysis of radioactivity and/or uranium and thorium isotopic composition in animal tissue, plant tissue and soil samples. Samples must be comparable to previous sample data from 2013-2014 to ensure continuity.

1.	Animal tissues, vegetation, dust, and/or soil samples will be submitted by the USGS Columbia Environmental Research Center (CERC) in one or more batches.  Animal tissues and vegetation will be lyophilized and homogenized at CERC prior to submission.  Soil and dust samples will be dried and homogenized prior to submission to GEL.

2.      Submitted sample weights will range from 1 to 2 grams total dry weight of tissue samples (vegetation and animal tissues).  Additional weight may be available for soil or dust samples, but cannot be guaranteed.  

3.	In carrying out this agreement, the Contractor shall be able to analyze samples measuring less than 1 pico-Curie per gram of sample for gross alpha/beta activity and/or for uranium and thorium isotopic composition or other requested analyses in tissue, vegetation, dust, or soil samples. 

4.  	Analyses of all sample matrices (vegetation, animal tissue, dust, and soil) will use a multi-tiered contingent approach: 
   	 
a) 	All samples will be screened for gross alpha/beta activities, and the results will be reported to CERC for review.  Results should be reported regardless of exceedance of post-collection sample holding times.

b) 	After CERC review, samples having positive gross alpha/beta detections may be down-selected by CERC for isotopic uranium analyses.  Results should be reported regardless of exceedance of post-collection sample holding times.  The CERC project manager or designee will provide, by e-mail, a list of the down-selected samples for isotopic uranium analysis to company within 30 business days of receipt of the gross alpha/beta report.  

c) 	Additional sample subsets may be further down-selected by CERC for analysis of (1) Isotopic Thorium, (2) Isotopic Radium, and/or (3) other analytes.  Results should be reported regardless of exceedance of post-collection sample holding times.  As before, the CERC project manager or designee will provide a list, via e-mail, of the down-selected samples for each additional study within 30 business days of receipt of the isotopic uranium analyses or of each additional analysis.  

Gamma Scan for Uranium daughters and Contingent Isotopic Uranium (U-233/234, 235/236, 238) and analysis method must be DOE HASL. Each analyte will be computed and reported for each sample in an EXCEL file using the sample identification information supplied by CERC. Laboratory shall provide a summary of results from internal quality assurance measures associated with the samples and discuss any unusual results. Laboratory will provide details of specific methods and any necessary deviations. Results for each sample batch submitted will report to the CERC within 120 days following receipt of samples. 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541380 and the size standard is $15.0 M. There is no incumbent contractor. 

All business concerns who believe they can responsibly perform this requirement should submit the following information to the contracting officer no later than 4PM CST Thursday May 05, 2016:

1.	Capability statement describing corporate expertise and technical qualifications in the work described above.
2.	Past performance information describing other contracts for similar services your company has been awarded. Past performance information should be submitted for projects conducted within the last three years and include: project title, location, whether the work was as a prime or subcontractor, contract/subcontract dollar value, type of contract, percentage of self-performed work, and overall performance rating received. 
3.	Small business status of vendor (8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, etc.)
4.	Point of contact information for vendor, Cage Code, and D&B Number.
5.	Any other information that will prove the vendor is capable of performing the required effort.

Submissions should be emailed Beth Wilson, Contracting Specialist at bwilson@usgs.gov. Responses should be limited to 10 pages (single-sided). 

NOTE: All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary - the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government. Materials submitted to the Government for review will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. This is not a request for proposals. The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses received under this announcement. 

All questions and concerns may be submitted to the contracting officer via email only at bwilson@usgs.gov.

The guide walls are founded on timber piles and a rock filled crib. Voids have been created in the rock filled crib due to wash out and settlement of the rock within the crib.

The contractor shall provide all plant labor and material to complete the contract requirements. This contract involves placing and sealing forms around the guidewall foundations and placing flowable grout to entirely fill the voids in the rock filled crib. This work will be accomplished during the non-navigation season, which is generally between December and mid March.

<p>Please submit capability statements by email to Jesse Onkka, Contract Specialist,<br />jesse.L.Onkka@usace.army.mil no later than Friday,&nbsp;6&nbsp;May 2016.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3.5K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: 
 VA255-16-AP-2697	1A. PROJECT/TASK No.
657-16-2-8543-0102 	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT:  $92,992.45
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:   The proposed action is for an award of a brand name firm fixed-price delivery order for the procurement and installation of A-Dec dental chairs, dental chair mounted monitors, delivery systems and assistant's delivery systems. This procurement is necessary for the emergency replacement of unusable dental equipment at both the John Cochran and Jefferson Barracks Division and for the activation of 3 new dental rooms at the John Cochran Division. The 3 current rooms are at risk of being shut down because of damaged equipment that does not meet certain standards. 


3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED: It was determined that only A-dec equipment can meet all of the St. Louis VA's requirements for the dental chairs and delivery systems. Half of this order is directly replacing A-dec dental chairs and delivery systems in current dental rooms located in the John Cochran and Jefferson Barracks Divisions. Since these replacements need to be compatible with other equipment in the current rooms, there is only one responsible manufacturer and no other supplied or services will satisfy. Also, for the three new rooms for the dental clinic expansion, only one source is compatible with the projected cabinetry and no other supplies and services will satisfy. Procuring any other type of equipment will cause a disturbance in work flow, disturbance in patient care, will require additional purchases of accessories and additional training will be required. 
The two current rooms in the John Cochran Division and the one current room at the Jefferson Barracks Division all have A-dec 12 O'clock dental assistant's delivery systems that are mounted to A-dec Preference Collection 5580 cabinetry. It is required that the 12 o'clock cabinetry match the assistant's delivery system because of mounting restrictions. It is required that the assistant's delivery system match the traditional delivery system at the dental chair because delivery systems must be from the same company in order to seamlessly perform procedures on a patient. It is a requirement that the traditional delivery system match the dental chair because of mounting and functionality restrictions. It is a requirement that the mounting monitors match the dental chairs because of mounting restrictions. For the three new rooms that are being constructed, they are being built to replicate the 8 current dental rooms in the John Cochran Division. This includes the type of examinations and procedures that will be performed. This also includes the type of cabinetry that will be installed in these three new rooms. The current plan is to purchase identical cabinetry to the current room configuration. Because of this, the plan would be to purchase the A-dec Preference Collection 5580 cabinetry that will be located at the 12 O'clock position. The only compatible assistant's delivery system to this cabinetry is the A-dec 545 12 O'clock Assistant's Instrumentation. Because of the above listed restrictions, it is required that all the equipment that is purchased must be manufactured by A-dec. This will allow the dental clinic to have the same equipment in all 10 dental rooms at the John Cochran Division. This will result in a seamless process for the dental clinic staff and patients for their examinations and treatment. 
A-dec is the only manufacturer that has the unique qualifications and equipment that the St. Louis VA requires in order to obtain the best value for this project and to successfully complete this project in a timely manner. Current dental rooms at both the dental clinics at the John Cochran and Jefferson Barracks division all have A-dec cabinetry, dental chairs and delivery systems. The three dental chairs and three traditional delivery systems that are replacing current equipment are all going in rooms where A-dec cabinetry and assistant's delivery systems are already installed. These rooms have the Preference Collection 5580 cabinetry installed along with the A-dec 545 12 O'clock Assistant's Instrumentation. These two items are mounted together through a special mount meant for these two items. No other delivery system has the ability to mount to the Preference Collection 5580 12 O'clock cabinetry. Next, the A-dec 545 12 O'clock Assistant's Instrumentation and the A-dec 532 Traditional Delivery Systems need to be from the same manufacturer because they are both delivery systems in a single room. They cannot be from different manufacturers because of examination/procedural restrictions, workflow interference and functionality restrictions. Because of this, it is required that all rooms have the A-dec 532 traditional delivery systems. Along with the traditional delivery systems, the only compatible dental chair is the A-dec 511 dental chair. These two pieces of equipment are made for each other and are meant to be installed together. Next, monitor mounts are needed on all of the dental chairs in order to display clinical images and data during examinations and other procedures. The only mounts that are compatible with the A-dec 511 dental chair are A-dec monitor mounts. The three new rooms are being constructed to replicate the 8 current dental rooms in the John Cochran Division. This includes the type of examinations and procedures that will be performed. This also includes the type of cabinetry that will be installed in these three new rooms. The current plan is to purchase identical cabinetry to the current room configuration. Because of this, the plan would be to purchase the A-dec Preference Collection 5580 cabinetry that will be located at the 12 O'clock position. The only compatible assistant's delivery system to this cabinetry is the A-dec 545 12 O'clock Assistant's Instrumentation. Because of the above listed restrictions, it is required that all the equipment that is purchased must be manufactured by A-dec. This will allow the dental clinic to have the same equipment in all 10 dental rooms at the John Cochran Division. This will result in a seamless process for the dental clinic staff and patients for their examinations and treatment. Procuring and installing A-dec equipment represents the best value consistent with FAR 8.4 because the facility has gone through extensive research to determine the best value option available. Quotes have been obtained from other manufacturers in order to determine what equipment they had to offer and the pricing. The A-dec equipment for all of the required equipment has similar cost values of other manufacturers. The main difference is that if another manufacturer is chosen, their equipment will not be compatible with the current room equipment and set up. Along with that, the new manufacturer equipment will require the purchase of additional training, purchase of a completely new set of disposables that will have to be regular stocked and disturbance of workflow.Because of these reasons, the best value option would be to go with A-dec manufactured equipment.
4. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED: The Government's technical experts conducted research in order to determine the types of dental chairs and delivery systems out there. Once facility market quotes were received, the respective products were investigated in order to determine if these units would be compatible in the facility's current room setup. After looking through product brochures and manuals, it was determined that the only compatible manufacture that will meet all of the St. Louis VA's needs is A-dec. 
Contracting conducted market research and there was more than more than one source to obtain the A-dec dental suites. These included A-Dec Inc., Paterson Dental and Henry Schein all are authorized distributors or manufacture.
5. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. Note: COs are required to make a determination of price reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3.  See the Commercial Supply and Service SOP for Price Reasonableness templates.
