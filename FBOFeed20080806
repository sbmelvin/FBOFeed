This part required engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part.  Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s).  The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part.  An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.  The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The Government physically does not have in its possession sufficient, accurate, or legible data to purchase this part from other than the current source(s).   The rights to use the data needed to purchase this part from additional source(s) are not owned by the Government and cannot be purchased, developed, or otherwise obtained.  It is uneconomical to reverse engineer this part. Acquisition of this item is restricted to Government approved source(s) because the production of this item involves unclassified but militarily sensitive technology (FAR 6.3) See Note(s) 26.

With the AxioVision software NCI will be able to operate the above camera and control all the functions of the existing AxioObserver Z1 inverted microscope and Colibri illumination system.  Software should be capable of advanced operations, such as image deconvolution, as well as exporting unchanged image data to other software applications for more specialized analysis.  


Justification:  

Statute: 13.106-(b)(1) 

	(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officer may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency, exclusive licensing agreement, or industrial mobilization).

The Chromosome Structure and Regulation Section as well as DNA Recombination in Yeast Section of the Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (LBMB), CCR, NCI, investigate molecular and biochemical processes controlling chromatin and chromosome structure and chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis. Planned research requires the detailed analysis of the structure of chromosomes in live cells, using fluorescently tagged proteins. However lack of appropriate equipment currently limits this kind of research.  Recently NCI acquired Axio Observer Z1 inverted microscope and Colibri illumination system from Carl Zeiss Microimaging Inc. as initial parts of the planned live cell imaging setup.  To make the system complete NCI needs the sensitive scientific CCD camera and control computer/software. Those remaining components need to be flawlessly integrated into the same hardware and software environment.


Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc. is the U.S. Dealer for the Hamamatsu C9100-13 EM-CCD imaging camera, and the sole provider of the Z30 workstation and the AxioVision software that can aid the NCI with its research; investigates genetic changes that define metastasis and signal transduction pathway for sarcoma cells survival and studies the role of oncogenes, growth factors, growth factor receptors, and downstream effector molecules in activation and proliferation.   Carl Zeiss will install the Hamamatsu camera and software and assure that the integrated imaging system (including also AxioObserver microscope and Colibri LED illumination system) is fully operational.

<DESC> The National Cancer Institute (NCI); Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG); Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB) plans to procure on a sole source basis, Nail element concentrations and risk of esophageal cancer with University of Missouri Research Reactor Center; University of Missouri- Columbia; Columbia, Missouri, 65211-33400.

The supplies herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-(b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 611310 and the business size standard is 6.5 M employees.

The Nutritional Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI is studying the hypothesis that differences in element status are associated with the different risks of esophageal cancer.  Toenails can be used to determine trace element status 8 months to less than 1 year prior to collection and thus provide a meaningful estimate for use in epidemiologic studies.  The NCI plans to measure toenail element concentrations in 500 subjects to assess the association between trace elements and the risk of esophageal cancer.  

The toenails provide a valuable method of estimating element status prior to diagnosis in cross-sectional case-control studies.  The University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) provides the required services to research groups that measure nail element content in epidemiologic studies.  Using Neutron Activation Analysis, MURR can determine the concentrations of the full suite of elements from the existing toenail sample without destroying the nails.  Other methods, such as atomic absorption or inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, can only measure single elements or require that the sample be destroyed. The services provided by the Missouri Research Reactor are demonstrated to provide accurate and valid measurements acceptable for publication in the peer reviewed literature.  The University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) is the only source known to the NCI that can complete the testing.

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can meet this requirement.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate a sole source, firm-fixed priced purchase order with PureWorks, Inc. located at 1321 Murfreesboro Rd, Suite 200, Nashville, TN 37217 for a library of online web-based training courseware customized for SSA.  PureWorks will provide courseware that includes safety/occupational health topics and continued maintenance to support five (5) SSA Private Label Library courses: Asbestos Awareness, Fire Extinguisher Safety, Hazard Communication, Preventing Back Injury, and Preventing Slips, Trips and Falls that were previously developed for SSA and copyrighted by Pure Works, Inc. The text of all courses is fully editable for SSA, and meets Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (ADA compliant).  The courseware is hosted on server and is accessed via the internet. Training is intended for office occupational safety and health representatives located at SSA facilities nationwide in order to meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1960,  Basic Program Elements For Federal Employee Occupational Safety And Health Programs And Related Matters  and SSA/AFGE Agreement, Article 9. Period of Performance shall be for 12 month period beginning September 23, 2008 through September 22, 2009.  Under FAR Part 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Sources Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This contractor is uniquely qualified because of its copyrighted coursework previously developed, implemented and currently used by SSA.  This notice is for informational purposes only and is neither a request for quotation nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. It is SSA's belief that PureWorks Inc. is the only source qualified to meet our needs, in that other sources could not provide comparable training course specifically tailored to SSAs needs without substantially increased costs to the Government to replace and supplement courses that Pure Works currently provides to SSA. SSA will not issue a solicitation. SSA will not respond to requests for solicitation copies and will not pay for information received in response to this announcement. Responses must provide sufficient information for SSA to determine that a firm other than PureWorks Inc. can provide the web-based online training courseware as described above. If SSA does not receive an acceptable response to this announcement within 7 days of its publication, it will proceed as stated herein. See Numbered Note #22, substituting (per FAR 5.203(a) and 12.204(b)) a response time of seven days for this acquisition of a commercial item for the forty-five day response time appearing in the note.  The Government will consider all responses but a determination by the Government not to compete this action is solely at the discretion of the Government. This requirement will be procured utilizing procedures in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items, in conjunction using procedures under FAR Part 13. This is not a request for quotations or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, but merely notification of the Government's intent to order this web-based training from PureWorks . Requests for copies of a solicitation in response hereto will not be honored or acknowledged.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered for the purposes of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Government does not intend to pay for information provided in response to this publication.  Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. If no affirmative, responses are received within 7 business days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1 (b)(1) negotiations will be conducted with PureWorks,Inc.  as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted. Respondents should refer to 0816-08-3538.

<DESC><p>Synopsis:Provide an enterprise-wide Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS) with RIS/HIS for the Veterans Integrated Service Network 20 (VISN 20) that will both replace our current cPACS as well as provide PACS capability in facilities that are currently only operating with VistARad. The contractor will provide all hardware, software, installation, training and ongoing full maintenance support. VISN20 seeks to implement a VISN-wide PACS that is integrated with a single datacenter located in Vancouver, WA. VISN 20 is comprised of multiple physical sites, comprising nine (9) main organizational entities. The care facilities are located at the following locations: 1. Portland, Oregon (includes Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington) 2. Roseburg, Oregon 3. White City, Oregon 4. Vancouver, WA (Data Center) 5. Puget Sound (includes Seattle and American Lake, Washington) 6. Spokane, Washington 7. Walla Walla, Washington 8. Boise, Idaho 9. Anchorage, Alaska Each sites' RIS (Radiology Information System) is VistA (Veterans Information Systems &amp; Technology Architecture). Four of the facilities also have an existing cPACS installed at their location - provided by a commercial PACS provider. VISN 20 seeks to implement a VISN-wide PACS, such that any image obtained at ANY VISN 20 site is easily accessible from any other VISN 20 site and such that a list of prior imaging exams for any given patient includes imaging exams performed at all VISN 20 facilities. We have formal working relationships with a number of private academic institutions and military bases: for instance, the Portland Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC) is a medical affiliated facility with Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU). There are PACS to PACS MOU's in place to securely and directly (i.e. not on CD but through direct fiber and network connections) transfer data between the applications/organizations. We need to be able to continue these relationships. In addition to these affiliations, we have a need to send images to private sector Radiologists working in groups as contractors with the VA. Finally, some VA radiologists and clinicians may need access to the PACS images in their homes (via home telerad). This procurement is unrestricted. All bidders must be registered in CCR at http://www.ccr.gov to be eligible for award. NAICS 423450 applies-size standard is 100 Employees. The estimated dollar value of this procurement is $13,000,000. In order to receive e-mail notification of amendments, you must register in FedBizOpps to Receive Notification of amendments.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District, Bonneville Lock and Dam Project, requires the services of an architect-engineer firm to perform a design analysis check and possible new design of the main boom and jib of the crane.  The existing crane is a 56 Ton Pedestal type located at the upstream north end of the Bonneville Navigation Lock No. 2.  The cranes main picks include handling navigation lock stoplogs.  Usage of the crane is very low with an estimate average main pick cycle of 8 every 5 years, and no more than 10 cycles per year of half-load or less picks.  An architect-engineer purchase order shall be awarded for the accomplishment of the required services.  The estimated start date for the services is 30 August 2008.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://ccr/edi/disa/mil or by contacting the CCR Assistance Center at 1-800-227-2423.  2. SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED.  The subject crane was completed and put into use in 1991.  In the early summer of 2006, a Government operator noticed what looked like a crack in one of the boom lattice members.  Further investigation by Government employees revealed that a crack did exist in the lattice member.  The Government obtained contractual services to provide an on-site inspection and inspection report of the boom members.  The report noted weld defects and undersized welds when compared to the as-constructed drawings.  This purchase order shall consist of Mandatory and Optional Services. Under this purchase order, the Contractor shall be required provide the following services:  a. Limited Design Check (Mandatory).  Field inspect boom (main and jib) members and welds, familiarize themselves with the actual field conditions as compared to the as-constructed drawings and prepare a report of inspection findings, including any obvious material and/or construction issues noticed during the inspection.  Prepare a design criteria document which specifies which standards will be used, how they will be applied, and how the crane will be classified.  The document shall include all design information, dead and live loads, load combinations, impact factors, wind factors, and allowable stresses.  The criteria document shall cover the requirements of the limited design check of the main boom as well as the full design analysis of the main boom and jib and new main boom and jib design.  Prepare a finite element model (FEM) of the boom.  The model shall include every  member of the boom as an individual element in the model.  The Contractor shall use a structural type program and shall include AISC code check features.  If the program used does not provide for weld sizing and joint checking, an additional spreadsheet shall be developed to provide these in the analysis.  Apply the dead load and rated loads to the model.  Rated loads shall be based on existing crane load chart.  Member stresses and connections shall be checked.  Prepare a report with findings.  The report shall provide recommendations and/or conclusions as to whether a more complete boom analysis is required to verify boom adequacy or if a new boom design is required.  Note that the field inspection report can be combined with the boom analysis report.  b. Full Design Analysis (Optional).  Using the FEM developed in the above item, a full analysis shall be run.  This shall include impact, wind loading, and all other factors required for a full analysis.  Prepare a report with findings.  The report shall provide recommendations and/or conclusions on whether the existing boom is adequate as is, or can be modified to become adequate, or if a new design is warranted.  c. New Design (Optional).  A new boom design shall be provided.  This design will use a FEM and other computer program and hand calculations to provide a main and jib boom design that provides the same rated performance as existing.  All load factors and load conditions shall be met with the new design.  The design shall physically match up with the existing crane, requiring no changes to any crane components.  d. Design Standards.  As discussed above, the Contractor shall determine which standards are to be applied to the limit design check, full analysis, and new design. Standards that shall e considered for the application include: a)AISC;  b) American Institute of Steel Construction, 13th Addition; c)ASME B 30.4 (Portal, Tower, and Pedestal Cranes; d) ASCE 7, Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and other Structures, 2002 American Society of Civil Engineers; e) CMAA 70 Crane Manufacturers Association of America, For Electric Overhead Traveling Cranes; f) UFC 3-320-07N Weight Handling Equipment; g) AWD D1.1 American Welding Society Structural Welding Code  Steel<BR>3.

The business proposal shall ensure that all elements of the Schedule of Deliverables, corresponding tables, and appropriate representations and certifications are completed.  Offerors should read the terms and conditions of this solicitation carefully and refer any questions to the Contracting Specialist.  Proposals shall be prepared using Arial or Times New Roman; 11-point font style on 8x11 inch white paper.  Tables and illustrations may use a reduced font style, not less than 8 points.  Foldouts are not allowed.  All material will be double spaced.  Offerors should ensure that each page provides identification of the submitting Offeror in the header or footer.  Page count for the combined business proposal shall not exceed 15 total pages, inclusive of product literature.  To supplement their written proposal, offerors may provide a CD-ROM with supporting information that illustrates the degree of compliance, quality, safety and reliability.  There is no limitation for the CD-ROM, however all material provided through this medium shall be appropriately referenced in the written proposal; the CD-ROM shall not be considered a stand-alone element of the offeror.  To support their business offer, offerors are requested to submit electronic pricing workshops (e.g. Schedule of Deliverables) (e.g. MS Excel) inclusive of formulas, also on the CD-ROM.  If conflicts arise between material presented in the proposal and the CD-ROM, the precedence for consideration shall be with the written material.

Sealed offers for the items to be provided shall be hand-carried, e-mailed to byron.moody@usmc.mil, or express mailed via UPS or Federal Express to arrive at the following location no later than 1000 (EST) 22 August 2008; Regional Contracting Office; ATTN: Sgt Byron Moody; Bldg 2010 Henderson Road; MCB Quantico, VA 22134.  Note:  Offerors are advised that proposals sent by conventional US Mail Service are not routed to the above address.  FAR 52.212-2:  EVALUATION: COMMERCIAL ITEMS:  The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract as a result of this solicitation.  Each Offeror shall submit a proposal that clearly and concisely describes and defines the Offerors response to the requirements of this solicitation.  Use of general or vague statements such as standard procedures will be used will not satisfy this requirement.  Unnecessary elaboration or presentations beyond that sufficient to present a complete and effective proposal are not desired and may be construed as an indication of the Offerors lack of understanding.
M-1.2.  The offeror shall demonstrate a thorough understanding of the requirement of the Statement of Work and provide a proposal in accordance with the evaluation criteria in Section M.  The Offeror shall also demonstrate they have the appropriate mix of experienced personnel to provide these services.
M-1.3.  All information must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to make a comprehensive evaluation of the Offerors understanding of the SOW and of the Offerors capability for successful performance.  The proposal should demonstrate this understanding and capability in a concise, logical manner and should not contain superfluous material not directly related to this solicitation.
M-1.4.  The following factors are listed in descending order of importance.
M-1.5.  This solicitation will be awarded based on a Best Value Basis, price and other factors considered.  Non-price factors such as Technical Capability, Management Plan, and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  As the technical differences narrow, cost becomes more important.  The Government shall not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost or price to achieve only slightly superior technical features.
M-2  Factors
M-2.1  Technical Capability
M-2.1.1.  The Offeror will be evaluated on its demonstrated ability to consistently and expertly perform, coordinate, and manage all tasks within the SOW.
M-2.1.2.  The portfolio will be evaluated to assess the offerors artistical and technical capability.
M-2.2  Management Plan 
M-2.2.1.  The Management Plan factor will be evaluated to assess each Offerors ability to manage the requirements of the SOW, provide appropriate staffing, meet milestones, maintain a safe and secure work environment, and minimized the adverse affect of the work  on the experience of visitors to the NMMC.
M-2.3.  Past Performance
M-2.3.1.  The Past Performance Factor will be evaluated to determine how well the Offeror has performed in the past as an indication of how well the Offeror may perform in the future.  The Government will evaulate past compliance with contract requirements, appropriateness of personnel, reliability, responsiveness, and whether all tasks were completed on time.
M-2.4  Price
M.2.4.1.  Proposed prices will be evaluated for price reasonableness and considered in the overall evaluation of best value to the Government.  A tradeoff among Non-Price and Price factors allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal where the evaluation determines that the benefit of the higher priced proposal shall merit the additional price.
M.2.4.2.  Although price is the least important factor, it becomes increasingly important when offerors receive similar ratings for the other factors. Prospective Offerors are forewarned that a proposal meeting solicitation requirements with the lowest evaluated price may not be selected if award to a higher evaluated price, offeror is determined to be most advantageous to the Government.

The JMRC is responsible for providing tough, realistic, combined arms, joint and multinational training for US Army Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) and other units in an environment that prepares them for deployment to combat operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  During FY 2009 (October 2008 through September 2009) the JMRC will conduct approximately 8 rotations for units preparing to deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan.  Each rotation cycle will last 28 days.

This Statement of Work (SOW) addresses the critical training needs necessitated by an adaptable and persistent enemy in Iraq and elsewhere.  The JMRC desires to provide realistic training to identify and defeat current and emerging trends and replicate best practices, as well as to train its troops in the interaction with Iraqi leaders within local government agencies and enemy forces.

The personnel will adequately replicate the specified tasks associated with their position to include all activities which normally occur in Iraqi/Afghan society.  In general, rotations are conducted over a period of 21 days.  The first five days are normally devoted to vehicle and equipment draw as well as pre-rotational classes.  The next 16 days are Training Days (TDs) during which the rotational unit conducts Situational Training Exercise (STX) Lanes, followed by the entire brigade training on full spectrum operations, Force-on-Force (FoF), focused on the counter-insurgency operating environment.  <BR>1.2	Gender Composition.  The Contractor shall furnish the number of COBs required by each Task Order with, and will provide female role players as prescribed in the task order.

If the lessee is prohibited from using the leased slots based on this clause, the Government will consider requests for equitable adjustments related to the delay in obtaining a useful interest.  
ARTICLE 11 PROTEST AS A CONDITION OF SUBMITTING A BID FOR A LEASE,  THE LESSEE OR POTENTIAL LESSEE AGREES TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS RELATING TO PROTESTS:
     (a) Protests concerning leases, including without limitation protests concerning the proposed procedures for award of the leases, the award decision, proposed terms of the lease or the authority to conduct the auction shall be resolved through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) dispute resolution system at the Office of Dispute Resolution for Acquisition (ODRA) and shall be governed by the procedures set forth in 14 C.F.R. Parts 14 and 17, which are hereby incorporated by reference. Judicial review, where available, will be in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 46110 and shall apply only to final agency decisions. A protestor may seek review of a final FAA decision only after its administrative remedies have been exhausted.
     (b) Offerors initially should attempt to resolve any issues concerning potential protests with the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer should make reasonable efforts to answer questions promptly and completely, and, where possible, to resolve concerns or controversies. The protest time limitations, however, will not be extended by attempts to resolve a potential protest with the Contracting Officer.
     (c) The filing of a protest with the ODRA may be accomplished by mail, overnight delivery, hand delivery, or by facsimile. A protest is considered to be filed on the date it is received by the ODRA.
     (d) Only an interested party may file a protest.  An interested party is one whose direct economic interest has been or would be affected by the award or failure to award a FAA lease.  Any air carriers who are not eligible to submit a bid (pre-proposal submission protests) or any air carriers who did not submit a bid (post proposal submission protests) are not "interested parties" within this definition.
     (e) A written protest must be filed with the ODRA within the times set forth below, or the protest shall be dismissed as untimely:  
          (1) Protests based upon alleged improprieties in the anticipated lease or procedures to award the lease that are apparent prior to the time set for receipt of bids shall be filed prior to  the time set for the receipt of bids.           (2) In procurements where proposals are requested, alleged improprieties that do not exist in the initial solicitation, but which are subsequently incorporated into the solicitation, must be protested not later than the next closing time for receipt of bids or proposals following the incorporation.
         (3) For protests other than those related to alleged lease improprieties or improprieties in the proposed lease procedures, the protest must be filed on the later of the following two dates:
              (i) Not later than seven (7) business days after the date the protester knew or should have known of the grounds for the protest; or
              (ii) If the protester has requested a post-award debriefing from the FAA Contracting Officer, not later than five (5) business days after the date on which the Contracting Officer holds that debriefing.
     (f) Protests shall be filed at:
          (1)   Office of Dispute Resolution for Acquisition, AGC-70,                  Federal Aviation Administration,                  800 Independence Ave., S.W.,                  Room 323,                  Washington, DC 20591,
                 Telephone: (202) 267-3290,                  Facsimile: (202) 267-3720; or
          (2) other address as specified in 14 CFR Part 17.
     (g) At the same time as filing the protest with the ODRA, the protester shall serve a copy of the protest on the Contracting Officer and any other official designated in the SIR for receipt of protests by means reasonably calculated to be received by the Contracting Officer on the same day as it is to be received by the ODRA. The protest shall include a signed statement from the protester, certifying to the ODRA the manner of service, date, and time when a copy of the protest was served on the Contracting Officer and other designated official(s).
     (h) Additional information and guidance about the ODRA dispute resolution process for protests can be found on the ODRA Website at http://www.faa.gov.
ARTICLE 12 Novation and Change-of-Name Agreements (a) In the event the Leasee wishes the Government to recognize a successor in interest to the Lease due to a transfer of assets or an applicable merger, the Leasee must submit a written request to the Contracting Officer with the required documentation. This is required in order to obtain the Government's consent for the successor Leasee to assume the lease.(b) For a change of Leasee name the leasee agrees to provide the necessary documentation to establish that a legal name change has been made, including any revision to payment addresses/accounts.
(c) The Leasee agrees to follow the procedures and provide the documents, as requested by the cognizant Contracting Officer, described in AMS Procurement Guidance T3.10.1, "Novation and Change-of-Name Agreements." 
(d) When it is in the Government's interest not to concur in the transfer of the Lease from one company to another, the Leasee remains subject to all Lease terms and conditions including termination for default should the Leasee be shown to be engaged in anticompetitive behavior concerning the Lease.  
ARTICLE 13 Termination for Convenience of the Government (Fixed Price)  (a) The Government may terminate this lease in whole or, from time to time, in part if the Contracting Officer determines that a termination is in the Government's interest.

(b) After receipt of a Notice of Termination, the leasee shall proceed in accordance with the direction in the letter. (d) After termination, the Leasee shall submit a final termination settlement proposal to the Contracting Officer in the form and with the certification prescribed by the Contracting Officer. The Leasee shall submit the proposal promptly, but no later than 1-year from the effective date of termination, unless extended in writing by the Contracting Officer upon written request of the Leasee within this 1-year period. However, if the Contracting Officer determines that the facts justify it, a termination settlement proposal may be received and acted on after 1 year or any extension. If the Leasee fails to submit the proposal within the time allowed, the Contracting Officer may determine, on the basis of information available, the amount, if any, due the Leasee because of the termination and shall pay the amount determined.
(e) Subject to paragraph (d) above, the Leasee and the Contracting Officer may agree upon the whole or any part of the amount to be paid because of the termination. The amount may include a reasonable allowance for a prorated share of the lease term paid for, but unused. However, the agreed amount, whether under this paragraph (e) or paragraph (f) below, exclusive of costs shown in subparagraph (f)(3) below, may not exceed the total Lease price.  The Lease shall be amended, and the Leasee refunded the agreed amount. Paragraph (f) below shall not limit, restrict, or affect the amount that may be agreed upon to be paid under this paragraph.
(f) If the Leasee and the Contracting Officer fail to agree on the whole amount to be refunded because of the termination of the lease, the Contracting Officer shall pay the Leasee the amount determined by the Contracting Officer.
(g) If the termination is partial, the Leasee may file a proposal with the Contracting Officer for an equitable adjustment of the price(s) paid for the remainder of the lease.  (h) Unless otherwise provided in this Lease or by statute, the Leasee shall maintain all records and documents relating to the terminated portion of this Lease for 3 years after final settlement. The Leasee shall make these records and documents available to the Government, at the Leasee's office, at all reasonable times, without any direct charge. If approved by the Contracting Officer, photographs, microphotographs, or other authentic reproductions may be maintained instead of original records and documents.
ARTICLE 14 Default (Fixed-Price Supply and Service) (a) The Government may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of default to the Leasee, terminate this Lease in whole or in part if the Leasee fails to perform any provisions of this Lease.
(b) Prior to terminating a Lease for default, the Government will issue a show cause notice permitting the Leasee to present any defenses it may have to the default termination.
(c) If the Government terminates this Lease in whole or in part, it may retire or sell the slots remaining under the lease.  Whether the slots are retired or auctioned, the Leasee will receive no compensation. 
(d) If, after termination, it is determined that the Leasee was not in default, or that the default was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for the convenience of the Government. 
(e) The rights and remedies of the Government in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this Lease.

ARTICLE 15 Bankruptcy In the event the Leasee enters into proceedings relating to bankruptcy, whether voluntary or involuntary, the Leasee agrees to furnish, by certified mail or electronic commerce method authorized by the Lease, written notification of the bankruptcy to the Contracting Officer responsible for administering the Lease. This notification shall be furnished within five days of the initiation of the proceedings relating to bankruptcy filing. This notification shall include the date on which the bankruptcy petition was filed, the identity of the court in which the bankruptcy petition was filed, and a listing of Government contract numbers and contracting offices for all Government contracts against which final payment has not been made.

<DESC>Statement of Work for a Web Based Environmental Management System (EMS) Program
The Maritime Administration is completing an EMS program at the National Defense Reserve Fleets and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in accordance with EO13423, Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management and DOT Order 5641.1A.  In facilitating this program and to keep records and management functions in a centralized place, a web based program is being implemented.  The web based EMS program will be used to ensure communication of existing and future environmental objectives and targets are met, and the Agency continually improves - a key element function in ISO 14001, Environmental Management Systems.  
The primary objective of the web-based EMS program is to coordinate the management procedures with the regional environmental managers, and their EMS Core Teams.  
(1) Web based EMS:
Web based EMS system will be designed to allow the Maritime Administration to manage their EMS system over the Internet.  Web based EMS program will be  based on the principles set forth in ISO 14001 standard, and will have separate tabs for each of the major EMS requirements, such as environmental policy, aspects, objectives/targets, documentation, training, audits, corrective action, and management review. 
The program features will include:
1) Different permission levels to allow access to only certain information.2) Capability to manage the EMS training program by identifying training needs by job title and tracking training completion.3) A compliance calendar to track key compliance and other requirements related to the EMS.4) Capability to manage environmental aspects through entering and ranking them for significance based on criteria selected by the organization.5) Capability to establish objectives, targets, and the ability to track them for completion.6) Capability to control documents and records, including procedures, SOPs, and sampling data.7) Capability to schedule and track the results of audits and corrective actions.8) Capability to schedule and show the status of management reviews.9) A personalized "dashboard" to show what information that may be needed at a glance in real time.
(2) Web based Metrics:
A web based metric program will allow the Office of Environment  to enter, track, graph, and report key environmental or other performance metrics over the Internet and also report environmental incidents. 
The program features will include:
1) Capability to view compare, analyze, and graph a variety of real-time environmental or other performance metrics from numerous sources across your organization at any level.2) Capability to compare individual facilities or departments against each other and even normalize data to yield a more meaningful comparison.3) Capability to calculate "carbon footprint" based on fuel usage or other metrics that relate to carbon dioxide emissions.4) Capability to download key data for further analysis or generate reports for management presentations.5) Capability to report environmental incidents, such as spills or notice of violations (NOVs), instantly to key people within your organization through text messages or email.6) Capability to track the status of environmental incidents and maintain a response history.7) A personalized "dashboard" to show what information we may need to know at a glance in real time.
The Maritime Administration will host the applications on its own server. Standard modifications will be made to tailor the program to our specific needs such as Maritime Administration-specific graphics, a dropdown list of facilities, and the compliance calendar. 
The following provides our proposed scope of services in accordance with our needs.  
Scope of Services
o The contractor shall meet with Maritime Administration's Headquarters in Washington to review and further define Maritime Administration preferences with regards to graphics, identifying facility inputs, and all administrative functions.o Contractor shall modify the applications to include Maritime Administration-specific graphics, a dropdown list of facilities, a compliance calendar, and the administrative functions that Maritime Administration prefers, such as e-mail notifications frequency and administrative rights/access. 
The following provides a breakdown of the administrative levels that Maritime Administration may want to consider in controlling access:
Super Administrator - This single account has complete control over the system including the ability to add and remove data.
Facility Administrator - This single account has complete control over the system at assigned facilities, including the ability to add and remove data.
Department Administrator - This single account has the ability to perform initialsystem setup, input data review data, administer user accounts, and add/delete data only at their specific department.
This role is capable of viewing facility data, although information may berestricted to certain facilities and/or individuals.
o Contractor will provide the applications on a CD for the Maritime Administration to upload into its own server and provide assistance in uploading.
o Maritime Administration will receive upgrades to the applications as part of its users license as the upgrades are developed.
If needed by this contract, the Contractor will perform training and provide other support as needed. IT support for customizing the application beyond its existing capabilities to meet Maritime Administration's may be considered.

The revised strategy under consideration could aid in achieving a near-term warfighting capability for the 105mm High Explosive (HE) projectiles while continuing to implement a competitive approach to meet the Armys longer-term full PGK objectives. 
The USG is interested in a System Development and Demonstration (SDD) and a Production phase for a 105mm HE projectile program. Following the SDD phase, the USG expects to obtain a Milestone C decision. The production phase will include as many as four production options (1 year per option). 
The USG desires pricing and delivery information for the SDD and Production phases to include developmental testing, technical reviews, and program milestones to attain a Milestone C decision and transition to production (including long lead material, equipment, etc.) 
This SDD phase pricing will cover initiation, planning, execution for development of a precision guidance kit that will meet the requirements in the draft performance specification dated 8 August 2008.   Additional pricing under SDD will cover 750 tactical units including GPS SAASM and 750 non-tactical units without Guidance Navigation and Control to support production qualification testing.
The Production phase pricing will include the individual prices for four production options which include a quantity range of 10,000 to 20,000 per year. 
Respondents should include an assessment of their technical readiness including applicable testing results or analysis that supports achieving the following threshold requirements for the M1, M927, M760 and M913 105mm HE projectiles: delivery accuracy of 30 meter CEP; GPS P(Y) SAASM; Reliability; and Enhanced Projectile Inductive Artillery Fuze Setter (EPIAFS) compatibility.Contractors are advised that no funding will be provided for preparation of the ROMS. 
Interested respondents may obtain the following upon request and coordination with POC listed below.  A Non-Disclosure Agreement (available upon request) signed and on file and a DD2345, and Form 1350 at a minimum, will be required:

<DESC><p><strong>The first ever Air Force Reserve/Air National Guard Teen Summit</strong> was held 14-18 July 2008 at the Wahsega 4-H Center in Dahlonega, GA. The summit was a tremendous success with two Teen Summits scheduled for <strong>July and August 2009</strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><em>Location&nbsp;of 2009 Teen Summit is Dahlonega, GA and Jeykll Island, GA.</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;92 teens attended from 32 states, some as far away as Alaska. Teens took leadership and environmental education classes and discussed issues they face as dependents of Air Reserve Component members. They also participated in high adventure activities including a high ropes course, zip line and a white water rafting trip. Representatives from 4-H, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, American Legion and Military OneSource presented information about programs and services currently available to them. Teens also discussed programs and services they need that are not available. Teens identified their top four issues as communication, transportation, recognition and awareness, and counseling and support, and presented their results to the AFRC/CC. A post evaluation of the summit showed an overwhelming response to the program, and requested that it become an annual event.&nbsp; <strong>Corporations and businesses interested in providing in-kind or monetary support in exchange for brand exposure within the military environment are encouraged to take advantage of the opportunities offered by this new sponsorship venue.</strong>&nbsp; <strong>Benefits include:</strong>&nbsp; <em><strong>product sampling; event title recogntion; name and logo recognition; and exposure to a military market including military members &amp; their families, retirees, civilians, and contractors of the US government.</strong></em>&nbsp; This is a new and exciting program for our military teens ages 15 - 18 yrs&nbsp;nationwide and we are proud to be the hosts for this impressionable and important &nbsp;event.&nbsp; More than one sponsor may be used and category exclusivity is dependent upon sponsorship.&nbsp; This is a solicitation for commercial sponsorship by a non-appropriated fund instrumentality of the United States government.&nbsp; It does not obligate appropriate or non-appropriate funds to the government.&nbsp; <strong>For more information on partnering with us and the sponsorship opportunities available, contact Phyllis Link at (478) 327-2101 or email:&nbsp; </strong><a href="mailto:phyllis.link@afrc.af.mil."><strong>phyllis.link@afrc.af.mil.</strong></a></p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to University of Washington, Childrens Hospital and Regional Medical Center, 4800 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98105 for an assessment of the impact of rotavirus vaccination on childhood gastroenteritis, due to their number of rotavirus case files. Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhea in US children less than 5 years of age, accounting for more than 30 percent of all severe childhood gastroenteritis episodes requiring medical attention. In 2006, a vaccine for rotavirus was licensed for use in the United States. Surveillance to assess impact of vaccination program against childhood acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a national priority. Linking routinely collected hospital discharge data with their vaccination status will provide an excellent, cost-efficient method of assessing the public health benefits of a rotavirus vaccination program. Since rotavirus disease can vary year to year at any given hospital, having baseline data from 2000-2006 will be important to assess trends in disease since vaccine introduction. The contractor will provide all labor, equipment, supplies and facilities necessary to: 1) examine computerized records of outpatient and emergency room (ER) visits and hospitalizations at Childrens Hospital (CH) in Seattle, WA for acute gastroenteritis among children less than 5 years of age during 2000-2008; and 2) to assess trends in all-cause AGE before and after introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in 2006, and provide the data to the Government. Contractor will conduct the following tasks: 1) Review of ED and  hospital discharge data. Hospital discharge data for July 1, 2000 through May 31, 2008, shall be reviewed to select those records with specific codes for Acute Gastroenteritis (AGE) in children 0-59 months of age. 2) Linking discharge data with hospital clinical laboratory data:  Clinical laboratory data for the  period July 1, 2000 through May 31, 2008 shall be reviewed to find results of rotavirus tests routinely ordered by health care providers for children 0-59 months of age.  These data will be linked to the ICD-9 discharge data on AGE visits. 3) Immunization data: Vaccination data shall be obtained on rotavirus case-patients from Nov 2007-May 2008 and control patients identified through the emergency department. The period of performance for this contract will be one year. Deliverables are data  on AGE discharge data from July 1, 2000 through May 31, 2008, rotavirus testing results, and vaccination data on case-patients and a group of control patients as well as an accompanying report with information deemed to be relevant for data analysis and. Data will be submitted on a compact disk in an Excel or other similar flat file. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Immunetics, Inc., 27 Drydock Avenue, 6th floor, Boston, MA 02210, for prototypes of a QuickELISA for the detection and quantitation of influenza H5 specific antibodies. ELISA-style assays are required for improvement over cell-based hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization assays. Assays require live virus; high-path avian influenza viruses must be done in BSL-3 high containment laboratories, but an ELISA based on recombinant HA as an antigen can be done in a standard BSL-2 laboratory throughout the world, which is required. Assay must be high-throughput, highly sensitive and quantitative, plus must be rapid (within 30 minutes for result). Assay should be able to process serum samples from any mammalian or avian species without changing any components of the assay. Assay is required to be easily incorporated into an automation system such as a Triturus EIA analyzer, so that hundreds of samples can be analyzed at one day, while at the same time it can be run on a bench top in a simple laboratory setting. Antigen-antibody reaction must occur with both entities in solution. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

<CONTACT>Ebony Fultz, Contract Specialist, Phone 2022730731, Email Ebony.Fultz@NLRB.gov - TaLisa M. Spottswood, Chief, Contracts and Procurement Section, Phone (202) 273-4040, Email talisa.spottswood@nlrb.gov
<DESC>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) intends to award a sole source contract to Dun and Bradstreet Corporation (D&B), 4350 North Fairfax, Drive, Suite 650, Arlington, VA  22203, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. The contract will be awarded for a base year and One Option Year.  The NLRB relies on D&B's Business Information Reports (BIR) to provide attorneys and compliance officers with comprehensive and detailed business information on companies.  As an information tool, the BIR helps the Regional offices determine whether cases brought before the Board have sufficient merit, which determines whether it continues in the case handling process.  The BIR is critical to case handling matters because it gives a D&B rating D-U-N-S number, in depth financials, bankruptcies, lawsuits, liens, payment histories, industry trends, corporate structure, company history, number of employees, UCC filings, and the location and description of the facilities. Moreover, D&B provides access to Dun and Bradstreet databases and services that provide comprehensive business information and related services. The NLRB relies on D&B's process for collecting and enhancing data which is called DUNSRight.  Founded on Quality Assurance, which includes over 2,000 separate automated and manual checks to maximize the integrity of the business data, DUNSRight also includes five drivers that work sequentially to aggregate, standardize and enrich the data: Global Data Collection, Entity Matching, the D-U-N-S Number, Corporate Linkage and Predictive Indicators.  These drivers facilitate case handling in a variety of ways. Global Data Collection aggregates data from hundreds of sources to provide superior breadth and depth of business information enabling the NLRB to make informed decisions.  D&B has Entity Matching, a proprietary method for integrating data that allows for and corrects variations in spelling (e.g. IBM vs. International Business Machines), formats, trade styles and addresses, among other elements, and associates data from disparate sources (e.g. a state business license, a federal 10K filing, a Yellow Pages listing) with the appropriate D&B record. At the heart of the NLRB company research is the D-U-N-S?  Number which is a unique, nine-digit identification code that is assigned and maintained solely by D&B.  The D-U-N-S Number is assigned to a company on a location-specific basis and remains with that specific business unit even if it closes or goes out-of-business. It is critical information when the research turns on the companies that have multiple names (d/b/a or a/k/a). Corporate Linkage helps the NLRB identify companies on a location-specific basis. The D-U-N-S Number also links members of their corporate families through Corporate Linkage. For NLRB purposes, D&B's business database features more corporate families than any other data provider with over 2.5 companies in the U.S. There is no limit to the breadth or depth of a corporate family tree.  There are occasions when the NLRB uses D&B's Predictive Indicators for statistical analysis to predict future performance. Predictive Indicators combine the analytical capabilities with unique D&B data capabilities, including industry-specific knowledge, financial and payment information on numerous private companies and extensive historical information for modeling and trend analysis purposes. This helps predict a companies potential for failure. 

Many Dun & Bradstreet databases are also available through gateways on other services, such as Dialog, Lexis and Westlaw, but the cost is prohibitive and full functionality of service and information is limited.

NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. 
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes, however all responses received before the closing date of this announcement will be considered by the Government. Information received will also be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Send responses to Ebony.Fultz@NLRB.gov, fax 202-273-2849 or mail responses to the National Labor Relations Board, 1099 14th Street, NW, Room 6100, Washington, D.C. 20570 by Friday, August 15, 2008 @ 3:30 pm.

The Poison Prevention Community Action Kit, is used to assist in reducing the incidences of poisonings by going beyond the traditional education and outreach on poison prevention to address the changing demographics and issues involving poisoning deaths in the United States. The existing kit will be enhanced and expanded to incorporate Poison Control Centers (PCCs) as a leading resource for poison prevention activities and provide additional outreach information on common poisonings. In addition, this contract will facilitate the implementation of workshops designation to establish partnerships between the NSC chapters and PCCs. 

It is expected that any resulting award will be a cost reimbursement award. Negotiations with The National Safety Council are expected to result in a contract with a period of performance of 12 months.  This procurement action will be procured on a sole source basis because the National Safety Council is the sole proprietor of the Poison Prevention Community Action Kit. The kit was originally developed through a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Awarding this work to another entity would result in significant duplication of effort, incurring a substantial cost on the governments behalf. The National Safety Council is deemed the only responsible source capable of providing the required work and service under authority in 41 U.S.C.253 (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(I).  This is not a solicitation.  A copy of the solicitation has not yet been produced.   If a contract award of more than $500,000.00 occurs as a result this action, a copy of the Justification for Other then Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) will posted at this site.  

Written inquiries must reference requisition number 08-N234-6015(eg). See Note 22.

<DESC><p><br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a contract to the Montefiore Medical Center, 111 East 210th Street, Bronx, NY 10467. Because of the complex nature of this study, the CDC requires assistance from an organization with extensive experience conducting clinical research studies. Montefiore Medical Center has received the necessary training, has obtained the required state and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals to conduct this study and has successfully collected and tested specimens for this study since January of this year. This sole-source requirement will purchase an additional 6 enrollment hours per day for a 1 year period, which are needed to successfully reach our enrollment target for this study. The vendor will collect clinical specimens, clinical symptoms and epidemiologic-linkage information from patients with prolonged cough illness (cough lasting more than 5 days). Potential study participants will be identified by vendor employed study staff working at Montefiore Medical Center (MMC). Study staff will collect nasopharyngeal specimens for culture and PCR testing, blood specimens for serologic testing, and oral fluid specimens for sIgA testing. Nasopharyngeal, oral fluid and blood specimens will be collected immediately following enrollment, and for participants with a cough duration of &lt;= 2 weeks, an additional convalescent blood specimen and oral fluid specimen will be collected 2 to 4 weeks post-enrollment. The vendor shall, as an independent organization, prepare the specimens, conduct culture and PCR, and accompanying documentation for transport to the CDC following CDC approved study specific procedures. Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the New York State Department of Health diagnostics approval that allows for test results within 24 hours. No other clinical research site could implement the study within the required timeframe. MMC is the only organization able to provide this service without program redundancy and an unneccessary reinvention of MMC services. Failure to procure this study via MMC will invariably cause a duplicative expenditure of considerable funds, and likely an inferior pertussis study being obtained by the CDC. Note 22 applies herein. The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1): FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for informational purposes. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Gary Morgan by email at glm1@CDC.gov or by fax to 770-488-2777.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; bids are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is 8614-806174_01 and is issued as an invitation for bids (IFB), unless otherwise indicated herein. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-24. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333293 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is a [ Small Business ] set-aside and only qualified offerors may submit bids. The solicitation pricing on www.FedBid.com will start on the date this solicitation is posted and will end on 2008-08-08 12:00:00.0 Eastern Time or as otherwise displayed at www.FedBid.com. FOB Destination shall be Washington, DC 20520<BR><BR>The Department of State requires the following items, Brand Name or Equal, to the following:  <BR>LI 001, Morgana Digifold - Folder: The system is a totally new technology to finish even the most sensitive of materials. The DigiFold is aimed at the print-on-demand market and handles output from digital color printing systems and heavy cross-grained stocks printed by conventional litho. Fully automated, compact and easy to use, the suction-fed DigiFold is the only automated folder using a creasing rule and matrix with the ability to crease material prior to folding. Unlike scoring, which breaks the surface of the material, the creasing rule and matrix mechanism prevents cracking during the folding process.The DigiFold uses a series of very large diameter fold rollers and a 'flying knife' to gently push the material between the fold rollers. A combination of large diameter rollers and the knife, which is speed matched to the material, helps to reduce the possibility of marking or scratching of the finished work. Unit can be used for perfing, scoring and slitting, but it is not fast and thus not recommended.The DigiFold can be set to operate in three modes: For standard folding configurations it works in set to fold mode where, once the required fold and sheet length have been selected, the units powerful program automatically sets the creasing and folding position. A motorized conveyor establishes the optimum position for stacking the finished work. In set to mode, the operator dials in the creasing and folding positions. This mode is particularly useful where extra creases are needed and allows difficult configurations such as the closed gate to be programmed. The third mode of operation allows the DigiFold to be used as an automated creasing machine from which the creased work is delivered flat. Alternatively, the creasing operation can be bypassed and conventionally printed and/or lighter stocks folded. This versatility adds to the printers productivity and ensures maximum utilization of the machine. Specifications:

The EPA believes that the Cepheid Smartcycler is the only equipment capable of interfacing seamlessly with the existing EPA owned Cepheid Smartcycler model SC2500N6-1, utilizing the same proprietary Cepheid software which, when operating in tandem with the existing Smartcycler system, will maintain consistency and uniformly produce indistinguishable results.

Additionally, current samples may also be tested for comparison with the previous mentioned sample groups.  Therefore, the introduction of a non-identical piece of equipment would introduce an unacceptable variable.

The EPA intends to solicit sole source from Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA the Smartcycler model SC2500N6-1.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.

(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.

(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) Clause 3052.209-70, Prohibition on Contracts with Corporate Expatriates (JUN 2006) (Continued)

 (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-APO-1), Jemal Building, 11th Floor, 1900 Half Street, S.W, Washington, DC 20590 Telephone (202) 475-3754 Fax: (202) 202-475-3904.

Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 18 JUL, 2008, 3:00 p.m., EST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.  Anticipated award date is on or about JUL 23, 2008. Contact Cindy Soules Cynthia.d.soules@uscg.mil or 252-335-6438 for questions regarding this solicitation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-APO-1), Jemal Building, 11th Floor, 1900 Half Street, S.W, Washington, DC 20590 Telephone (202) 475-3754 Fax: (202) 202-475-3904.

Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 18 JUL, 2008, 3:00 p.m., EST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.  Anticipated award date is on or about JUL 23, 2008. Contact Gail Payne gail.f.paynescg.mil or 252-335-6821 for questions regarding this solicitation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC><p>********Questions and Answers From Site Visit***********</p>
<p>Question: Is this area considered a confined space?<br />Answer: This area is considered a confined space and all appropriate OSHA and industry safety standards should be applied.
<p>Question: Can we block the road during performance?<br />Anwer: Blocking one lane of traffic to park trucks, etc. is fine. If it is really necessary, a 24 hour period of total road closure is possible.</p>
<p>Question: How should the area be prepped?<br />Anwer: The area should be prepped in whatever manner you feel is appropriate for the coating to adhere properly. The area is not overly dirty, but there is some residual #2 fuel oil and some small cracks.</p>
<p>Question: Does the pipe next to the tank need to be prepped/coated?<br />Answer: Only pipes penetrating the 4" rise area are an issue. They should be prepped and coated well enough so that it does not adversely effect the coating on the concrete and tank.</p>
<p>Question: What format should quotes be submitted?<br />Answer: There is no set format. Corporate letterhead is fine.</p>
<p>Question: Is open air blasting (for the purposes of site preparation) permitted?<br />Answer: The following were offered by engineering as a base standard for blasting and media:<br />1. No blasting when prevailing winds are toward either boiler room or flight trainer building.<br />2. Use a non silica based media.<br />3. Containment of media to the area of application is required. Tent or deflection barrier, etc...<br />Base will stop the job if media is threatening, mission, cars, infrastructure, or health.</p>
<p>Question: What is the wage classification for this job?<br />Anwer: Number 23760: Painer, Maintenance.</p>
<p>Question: Is there a warranty?<br />Answer: A one year warranty was effectively incorporated into the solicitation (see above changes.) The warranty is to be for one year with no cracks, blisters, or separation from the concrete wall in evidence. Remedy shall be removal of affected portion plus 6 inches and reapplication/patch.</p>

1752.224-70  Protecting Personally Identifiable Information		   	

	(a) Applicability

	This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific OPM requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act).  The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act.

	(b) Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

	Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mothers maiden name, etc. (http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2007/m07-16.pdf). In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic. 

	(c) Responsibilities for Handling PII

	(1) Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor. 

(2) All contract employees are personally responsible for the proper handling of PII, regardless of location.  All contract employees must be:
&#61607; responsible for the proper control and handling of PII residing on their computer, on removable media, and on paper documents.
&#61607; responsible for ensuring portable data storage and communication devices are properly controlled and secured at all times.
&#61607; responsible for the proper marking, control and storage of printouts and other paper documents containing PII in their possession.
&#61607; Email cannot be encrypted.  Since PII must be encrypted before being sent, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  Do not send PII in the content of an email.

	(d) Encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

	(1) OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network.  Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  OPM employees and contractors are required to encrypt PII data using WinZip.  Instructions on how to use WinZip to encrypt and protect files containing PII are available on Theo at: http://theo.opm.gov/helpdesk/selfhelp/WinZipv90EncryptionProcedures.pdf. WinZip can be used to protect data on workstations, laptops and email attachments.  It is available on all OPM workstations attached to the agencys network.   

	(2) A password protected file is not secure.  Never send any unencrypted PII data in e-mail.   

	(e) Procedures for Reporting a Breach of PII

	(1) A breach of PII includes loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access of personally identifiable information whether physical or electronic.  As an agency, OPM is required to immediately report all potential PII data breaches -- whether they involve paper documents or electronic information.  In order to meet this responsibility, OPM has established a new internal procedure for reporting the loss or possible compromise of any PII, and this clause conforms to that procedure. 

	(2) OPM contractors must report any breach or potential breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer within 30 minutes of becoming aware of the risk  regardless of the time or day of the week.  Breaches should be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. OPMs IT security experts, who will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention.  The OPM Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Report the breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer either by phone or by e-mail; however, be sure NOT to include PII in the e-mail.

(v)  The Food and Drug Administration is soliciting for supplies per the description as follows:

Scheduled items include: 

Purchase of Seven LCMS Systems, peripherals, and software with delivery, set-up, training, and maintenance at seven FDA laboratories in multiple geographic locations (Jefferson AR, Irvine CA, Lenexa KS, Jamacia NY, Bothell WA, Atlanta GA, College Park MD).

Objectives:
a. Purchase and setup instruments.
b. Train field staff on site and at vendor-sponsored classes.
c. Validate methods to monitor pesticide residues at seven FDA laboratories.  
d. Provide Warranty Service Agreement for instruments for a period of three years.

Minimum mass spec instrument requirements for this project:

Though each of these specifications are individually important to the success of the implementation of the system, a system which possesses and uses these features collectively is necessary to meet the governments objectives.

General Requirements:

An integrated high performance bench top hybrid triple-quadrupole/linear ion trap LC/MS/MS system. Instrument shall have an advanced source housing hosting interchangeable APCI (Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization) probe and ESI probe. The source probe housing shall feature high temperature ceramic heaters for high flow characteristics and orthogonal spraying for improved robustness utilizing interchangeable ESI and APCI sprayer probes. The source housing must have two viewing ports  one large frontal and one lateral - for best performance optimization.  Each probe must be coded for automated identification by the software/firmware of the host system.  The source housing must include a pair of high temperature ceramic heaters, creating symmetrical turbo gas streams for optimum sample desolvation.

ESI probe must be capable of: Ionization voltage:  From -4.5 kV to +5.5 kV, user selectable. Flow rate compatibility:  From 5 &#61549;L/min to 3000 &#61549;L/min, without flow splitting.
APCI probe should be capable of:  Flow rate compatibility:  From 50 &#61549;L/min to 3000 &#956;L/min, without flow splitting.  Corona discharge current:  From -5 &#956;A to +5 &#956;A, user selectable.  Nebulizer gas from 0 to 90 psi (0-0.62 MPa), user selectable using zero grade air or Nitrogen.  Turbo gas (GS2): From ambient to 750 Celsius and from 0 to 90 psi, user selectable. Zero grade air or Nitrogen.

The instrument shall include a syringe pump for direct infusion of samples that is capable of delivering flow rates between 10 uL/min to over 10 mL/min. The instrument should include a 10 port, 2 position switching valve capable of operating as an injector, diverter valve, or for column switching experiments.  Both devices have full software control.

The instrument shall contain at least a single thin aperture from atmosphere into the vacuum chamber which can be removed and cleaned without the use of any tools.  The aperture must be followed immediately by a high-efficiency RF-only ion guide for ion focusing and containment. This is followed by a high pressure RF quadrupole followed by a metal alloy quadrupole mass filter. A pre-filter is to be located between the RF quadrupole and the first mass filter to help further focus the ions.  The pre-filter region must be capable of cooling, slowing and holding ions prior to release into Q1 to enhance the sensitivity and avoid loss of ions (Q0 trapping).  The instrument shall employ a high-pressure quadrupole linear accelerator collision cell with axial electric field ion acceleration technology following the first mass filter used for high efficiency MS/MS fragmentation. The second mass analyzer shall be of a gold-plated ceramic quadrupole mass filter/linear ion trap design. The detector of the MS shall be an ion counting, discrete dynode, electron multiplier.
The system must have a mass range of 5  2800 m/z.  The system shall be able to perform the following: enhanced linear ion trap scan modes with enhanced MS scan for fast, sensitive full scan single MS.  System must allow for Q0 ion trapping and afford the following functions:

	Enhanced Multiply Charge scan significantly reducing the singly charged ion detection in a single MS scan.
	Enhanced Product Ion scan for fast, sensitive full scan MS/MS (up to 500 times more sensitive than traditional triple quadrupole product ion scanning).
	Enhanced Resolution scan for improved mass accuracy and charge state determination and/or isotope pattern determination
	MS/MS/MS scan for multistage fragmentation
	MS/MS/MS scan for selective quantitation to avoid matrix interferences.
	Time-Delayed Fragmentation scan to reduce the amount of secondary fragment ions detected in a full MS/MS scan
	Combine traditional RF/DC scan modes and Enhanced MS, Enhanced MS/MS and MS/MS/MS scanning capability through Information Dependent Acquisition (IDA) for MW and structural information from a single injection
	Product ion scanning for structural elucidation
	Precursor ion and neutral loss scanning

The instrument shall be able to vary the collision energy while filling the linear ion trap.  The instrument shall be able to run in normal MRM operations and using logic built into the software, automatically switch into Q3-Linear Ion Trapping mode for logic directed full spectrum confirmation of compounds.  The linear in trapping portion of Q3 much use axial ejection of the ions to the detector.  The instrument must be able to operate as a triple quadrupole, linear ion trap, and as a triple quadrupole and linear ion trap during the same run.
Q3 must be able to switch between MRM and Enhanced Ion Scanning in under 2 mSec.

The instrument must include a 550 pesticide MRM library which defines all the optimal parameters for MS/MS analysis, with defined chromatography and retention times for each compound. 

The instrument must be able to switch from positive ion to negative ion mode and back to positive ion mode. The instrument must be able to do this under continuous operation, saving the resulting positive and negative ion data to disc.  

Other Requirements:

For laboratory flexibility the integrated system must allow for the use of multi vendor HPLC interfacing with direct, single point software control resident to the MS software including Shimadzu Prominence HPLC systems, Agilent 1200, Dionex 3000 and Waters Acquity.  The proposal must include a Shimadzu binary modular HPLC system (flow rates 0.0001-10.0 ml/min.) with full software integration, autosampler with needle rinse pump, column temperature control module, 100ul semi-micro mixer, and pump solvent/autosampler rinse phase vacuum degasser.


An official authorized to bind the Offeror must sign the terms and conditions of the offer.  Offerors that fail to finish required representations, and certifications, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation, may be excluded from consideration.

(vi) Contract type: Commercial Item - Firm Fixed Price. Simplified procurement procedures in accordance with FAR 13.5 will be utilized.

<DESC>This solicitation is hereby amended to address questions/concerns from industry and to extend the due date for quotes.


Question:  Is homogeneity required or will our std spec be sufficient (standard spec. homogeneity over a 10mm Diameter sphere  .6%)?
Answer:   standard is fine.


Question:  Bore size
Answer:  Bore size is set by requirement of 50 square cm (required) and 75 - 100 square cm (greater consideration) area on the sample stage, as well as all other stages.


Question:  Field orientation
Answer:  Vendor's choice.


Question: Sample size
Answer:  Sample stage shall have a diameter of at least 10 cm (minimum), with at least 15 cm better (greater consideration).  However, we note that there is a tradeoff between sample stage size and total size/mass; vendors shall make the best combination of both specifications that they are able.


Question:  Cryostat Dimensions Tender requires 25 Kg x 1.5m high x 1m wide. The dimensions are similar to our standard system but the weight of the system required is 25Kg compared to 135Kg for our system.  Is 25Kg a typo on the tender? Can we quote something greater than 25Kg and not be penalized?
Answer:  25 kg is not an error; however, please note that this does not include the mass of any pumps, but only the mass of the cryostat (ie, Dewar and insert).

The specification for size and mass is listed in the "Greater consideration" section, not in the "minimum required technical specifications" section.  This answers the question regarding penalties.


The due date for quotes is hereby extended through Monday, August 25, 2008, 3:30:00PM EST.

All other terms and conditions remain the same.

<DESC><p><strong>THE NOTICE&nbsp;POSTED ON 5 AUG 2008 REGARDING PENDING RFP RELEASE OF THE E-H-E PROJECT IS HEREBY SUSPENDED.&nbsp; THE E-H-E RFP RELEASE IS HEREBY DELAYED INDEFINITELY UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.&nbsp; THE PUBLIC WILL BE NOTIFIED VIA FBO WHEN THE E-H-E RFP WILL BE RELEASED.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The time for receipt of proposals is hereby changed from 5:00 PM Central Time to 5:00 PM Eastern Time.&nbsp; However, this change is irrelevant until the E-H-E RFP can be released.</strong></p>
<p>Jones Lang LaSalle, a&nbsp;Privatization Real Estate Support Services (PRESS) Contractor, acting on behalf of the Air Force Housing Privatization Program Office - San Antonio, and the Headquarters Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), anticipates the release of its Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Privatization of Military Family Housing for the Eglin Air Force Base, Hurlburt Field and Edwards Air Force Base (E-H-E) project on 8 August 2008.</p>
<p>Jones Lang LaSalle intends to employ a one-step RFP process. In its proposal, each prospective Offeror (or Offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references and access to financial resources, financial strategy as well as a description of its technical approach to the&nbsp;E-H-E project as described in the RFP. Jones Lang LaSalle will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Highest Ranked Offeror (HRO) to the Air Force. The HRO will then begin negotiations with the Air Force and complete additional remaining submittal requirements needed for closing the real estate transaction. These additional submittal requirements are also identified in the RFP. The E-H-E project is a real estate transaction to privatize 2,620 military family housing units. The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 2,620 unit housing community for a lease period of 50 years. The Government will lease the land. The existing 2,801 housing units, primary and secondary associated utility and infrastructure systems, and other improvements will convey by Quitclaim Deed to the Project Owner (PO). The Government may subsidize the project's financing as described in the RFP. The PO will obtain private sector debt and will be responsible for managing and operating the E-H-E family housing inventory for the duration of the lease. This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The RFP will be available by 8 Aug 08 at http://www.jllpress.com.</p>
<p>The Air Force's goal is to provide military families access to safe, quality, affordable, well-maintained housing in a community where they will choose to live. The project provides a unique opportunity for top quality firms to assist in the development, operations and financing of this family housing privatization effort.</p>

<DESC>CANCELLATION NOTICE: Bids are being solicited under solicitation number 8614-806174.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; bids are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation is issued as an invitation for bids (IFB), unless otherwise indicated herein. If your company can provide the product/services listed on the solicitation and comply with all of the solicitation instructions, please respond to this notice. To view the specifications, please go to www.FedBid.com and reference Buy No. 78500.
 <BR><BR>GSA Schedule Bids Only:   Sellers bidding on this opportunity MUST have the items requested on an existing GSA Schedule. The Schedule must either be in the Seller's name or the Seller must be able to document its ability to act as an agent of a partner's Schedule. Sellers may offer Open Market items only in accordance with the approved Terms and Conditions of their respective GSA Schedule AND upon approval from the soliciting Contracting Officer. Information regarding GSA Schedules can be found at www.GSA.gov.<BR><BR> This requirement is unrestricted and only qualified sellers may submit bids.

FOB Destination shall be Washington, DC 20520 <BR><BR>The Department of State requires the following items, Brand Name or Equal, to the following:  <BR>LI 001, Morgana Digifold - Folder: The system is a totally new technology to finish even the most sensitive of materials. The DigiFold is aimed at the print-on-demand market and handles output from digital color printing systems and heavy cross-grained stocks printed by conventional litho. Fully automated, compact and easy to use, the suction-fed DigiFold is the only automated folder using a creasing rule and matrix with the ability to crease material prior to folding. Unlike scoring, which breaks the surface of the material, the creasing rule and matrix mechanism prevents cracking during the folding process.The DigiFold uses a series of very large diameter fold rollers and a 'flying knife' to gently push the material between the fold rollers. A combination of large diameter rollers and the knife, which is speed matched to the material, helps to reduce the possibility of marking or scratching of the finished work. Unit can be used for perfing, scoring and slitting, but it is not fast and thus not recommended.The DigiFold can be set to operate in three modes: For standard folding configurations it works in set to fold mode where, once the required fold and sheet length have been selected, the units powerful program automatically sets the creasing and folding position. A motorized conveyor establishes the optimum position for stacking the finished work. In set to mode, the operator dials in the creasing and folding positions. This mode is particularly useful where extra creases are needed and allows difficult configurations such as the closed gate to be programmed. The third mode of operation allows the DigiFold to be used as an automated creasing machine from which the creased work is delivered flat. Alternatively, the creasing operation can be bypassed and conventionally printed and/or lighter stocks folded. This versatility adds to the printers productivity and ensures maximum utilization of the machine. Specifications:

<DESC>The FDA intends to issue a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to identify, describe, and evaluate existing signal detection methods that could be employed by the FDA in support of the Sentinel Initiative.


Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.  As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable FDA to utilize the capabilities of multiple, existing data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, Medicare data, other medical claims databases) to augment the Agencys current surveillance capabilities. The System will enable surveillance or queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the time it takes for medical products under surveillance to be used by sufficient numbers of patients in participating health care databases. It is essential that FDA understand the timeliness of the surveillance possible in the Sentinel Initiative.

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The awardee will be responsible for the identification, description, and evaluation of existing signal detection methods that could be employed in the Sentinel Initiative.  

This work will require a thorough analysis of each methodologys: (1) utility for post-market surveillance of FDA-regulated drugs, biologics, and devices; (2) sensitivity, or ability to appropriately identify important safety signals; (3) specificity, or ability to appropriately identify the absence of important safety signals; (4) ability to minimize both false positive and false negative safety signals; (5) robustness of methodology to perform across different types of data systems for detection of different types of safety signals; (6) flexibility of the methodology to adapt to different situations and to change thresholds for different safety issues as desired and; (7) barriers that exist to using each identified methodology in the Sentinel Initiative.  

These analyses should lead to specific recommendations for further involvement of the most promising signal detection methodologies as the Sentinel Initiative moves forward.


The anticipated Period of Performance is Six Months from date of award.  The anticipated award type is Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP).  There is no anticipated Set-Aside Designation.  Competition is expected to be Full and Open.  The anticipated Procurement Procedures are those proscribed by FAR Part 13 for Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  And, the anticipated Basis of Award is Best Value.

The primary location of performance is anticipated to be at the contractors preferred location; however, the contractor may be required to travel to the Washington, DC/Maryland geographical area.

The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is anticipated to be: 541690  Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing advice and assistance to businesses and other organizations on scientific and technical issues (except environmental).  The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 Million.


This announcement is not a RFQ.  FDA anticipates release of the RFQ on or around August 9, 2008.  It will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities Web Site Home Page: http://fedbizopps.gov.


The anticipated quotation due date and award date for this effort is expected to be on or around September 2, 2008, and September 18, 2008, respectively.

<DESC>The FDA intends to issue a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to identify and evaluate population-based data sources that could be used to study the safety of blood and tissue products in furtherance of FDAs Sentinel Initiative.


Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.  As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable FDA to capitalize on the capabilities of multiple, existing data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, Medicare data, other medical claims databases) to augment the Agencys current surveillance capabilities. The System will enable queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the content, quality, searchability, and responsiveness of participating data sources and/or data environments. There is a particular need to evaluate the feasibility of these data sources to study blood and tissue products.  Many blood products are administered parenterally in outpatient stand alone clinics or infusion centers, settings that are beyond traditional inpatient hospital-based services.  Because of these and other varied settings of administration (blood centers, inpatient, ambulatory surgery, outpatient prescription, etc.), accurate identification of blood product utilization will require access to data sources beyond traditional prescription or inpatient claims surveys currently available to FDA.  Likewise, useful data sources will require particular capabilities to identify infections and other adverse events in recipients of human tissue products, which may be implanted in inpatient settings, dental offices, or ambulatory surgical settings, and are not usually inventoried in typical inpatient or outpatient pharmacy systems. It is essential that FDA understand the strengths and limitations of potential Sentinel Initiative data sources in studying blood and tissue product safety.  

The primary goals are to evaluate the ability of the potential data sources and/or environments to:

(1)  Evaluate the safety of blood and tissue products.
(a)	Measure blood and tissue product usage including, but not limited to, amounts, frequencies, and indications, as well as demographics and clinical characteristics of recipients.  Enrolled populations should be representative of the US population, and usage should be comprehensive enough to cover the varied clinical indications, care settings (inpatient, outpatient, infusion center, etc.), and product types for blood and tissue products.
(b)	Calculate incidence rates of adverse events by linking blood and tissue uses to subsequent patient healthcare claims.
(c)	Evaluate potential risk factors for developing adverse events.
(d)	Assess if adverse outcomes are attributable to the administered blood or tissue product (e.g., if rates are higher than expected based on analysis of appropriate comparison group)

(2) Accurately identify exposures (procedures involving tissue or blood products) and outcomes (infections and other adverse events of interest) in covered patients, and validate these data.  

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The work requires the identification and evaluation of population-based data sources that could be used to study the safety of blood and tissue products.

This work will require a thorough analysis of each data sources: (1) utility for post-market surveillance of FDA-regulated blood and tissue products (2) scope, content, structure, quality, and timeliness of data; (3) patient population(s), duration of follow-up, and capture of care across all settings; (4) availability, experience, and interest of investigators with knowledge of the data in using it for blood and tissue product safety surveillance as well as plans for further data source enhancements; (5) availability, experience, and interest of investigators with knowledge of the data in participating in a distributed data network; (6) potential privacy and security concerns related to the use of electronic health data; and (7) barriers that exist to including each data source in the Sentinel Initiative.  

These analyses should lead to specific evaluations of the feasibility to conduct safety related studies for blood and tissue products in each data source.

The anticipated Period of Performance is Six Months from date of award.  The anticipated award type is Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP).  There is no anticipated Set-Aside Designation.  Competition is expected to be Full and Open.  The anticipated Procurement Procedures are those proscribed by FAR Part 13 for Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>Navy, Military Sealift Command, is issuing this notice as a Request for Information to facilitate our market research, to determine if Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses possess the capability and capacity to execute the contract while performing the predominate share of the work in-house, are interested in participating in this acquisition as a competitive SDVOSB set-aside, and which NAICS code best describes the work.   This request is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a request for proposals or quotations.  

The Information Technology Policy & Planning Support Services (ITPPS) that are being contemplated through this Request for Information are for the provision of services to support the program management of IT projects for Military Sealift Command to include IT Asset Management, Portfolio Management, Budget Execution and Liaison Support, and Enterprise Architecture.  The provision of these services shall rely on the utilization of data tools that are currently available and shall not require the design or integration of new systems.  For example, Remedy is used for IT Asset Management Tracking and access shall be provided to this system during performance.  Moreover, Telelogics System Architect (SA) tool is used for the all EA diagrams and access shall be granted to this system during performance.  The Contractor must be proficient in the use of these applications to meet the ITPPS requirements.  Since all IT investments and acquisitions must comply with Federal laws, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidelines, the Business Transformation Agency (BTA), the Clinger Cohen Act (CCA) of 1996, and USTC, DON and DOD directives, the Contractor shall have an in-depth knowledge of all applicable laws, guidelines, regulations, mandates, and directives.

The following is a synopsis of the work and the travel requirements.  The estimated hours of work in each category are included (*corrected below) but could increase during peak demand periods by as much as 80%.   We anticipate needing a contract for one year with four one-year options for continued services.  Performance would not begin until after August 2009.

Interested parties are invited to submit the following:
a) Name of company
b) POC, telephone number, FAX number, address, and e-mail address (if available);
c) A brief description of the company and its core competencies or experience relevant to this work (descriptive literature/marketing material is welcome);
d) Small business standing (Veteran Owned, SDVOSB, woman owned, HubZone, disadvantaged business, etc.)

Please include a discussion on the following:

Do you currently possess the experience and financial and human resources to perform this work in-house or would a subcontract for more than 50% of the work be necessary?

Is NAICS 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, appropriate?  Considering the information technology policy background that may be necessary for successful performance, would an alternative NAICS be more appropriate?  If so, please suggest an alternative code with your rationale.  

* Correction: Anticipated effort in hours per year for Program Management, 2,000 hrs.; IT Asset Management, 2,000 hrs.; Portfolio Management, 4,000 hrs.; Budget Execution and Liaison Support, 4,000 hrs.; Enterprise Architecture, 4,000 hrs.
