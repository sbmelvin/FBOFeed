<DESC>NOTE: In accordance with the Agreement of Defense and Cooperation between the Kingdom of Spain and the United States of America, any contract resulting from this notice/solicitation can only be entered into with companies authorized to carry out these activities in Spain under Spanish law. Companies must meet the requirements established by Spanish legislation for execution of government works. Obtaining a license or permission to operate your company in Spain may be a long process; therefore, any company anticipating interest in future project should immediately begin the processes that will be required, by contacting the Delegation of Industry. They have two offices, one in the Madrid province and one in the Andalucia province. The telephone numbers are; 34 91 580-2100 (Madrid) and 34 95 504-8620 for Andalucia. The Air Force intends to solicit proposals (F61815-02-R-0005) for a Firm-fixed price contract to repair Underground Electrical Feeders 3 & 4. The expected magnitude of the project will be between $100,000.00 and $250,000.00.  The work will consist of  demolition and construction of electrical work.  The successful contractor will be selected using performance/price tradeoff procedures resulting in the best value to the Government. Past performance is considered of greater value compared to price. You are requested to notify the following E-Mail addressee if you intend to download the solicitation that will eventually be posted on this posting service; elia.portz@moron.af.mil . It is highly recommended that you register to be notified of any new postings for this solicitation and/or any other postings published by our office.

Therefore, you should check EPS frequently for any new postings that may have been made. As a last resort if you can not download the solicitation from the Internet EPS site, we will provide a CD ROM Disk, however, you must provide two working day notice (work days are Monday through Friday except Spanish and American holidays) of your request for a CD ROM Disk to the above E Mail addressees or to FAX 95 584-8054.

In order to be awarded a contract by the U.S. Government in excess of $25,000.00, the company must have a DATA UNIVERSAL NUMBERING SYSTEM (DUNS) NUMBER. If you do not already have one, it is suggested you contact Dun and Bradstreet at Web sites http://www.dnb.com/dunsno/whereduns.htm or http://www.dun.es/. Failure to have a DUNS number at the time of award may delay the award and depending on the criticality of the project, may be cause to award to the next qualified best value offeror who has a DUNS number. All contractors are advised that they should be registered in the Central Contractor Registry. Registration can be made on line at http://www.ccr2000.com/. NOTE: You must have a DUNS number to register. Further, in accordance with Section L, Provision L-204 a COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT ENTITY (CAGE) CODE REPORTING is required.
