<DESC>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514
<p>TITLE: Airborne Connectivity and Dissemination</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-12-08</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSERTION (CFDA) Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory - Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) is soliciting white papers under this BAA for research, design, development, test, evaluation and experimentation of innovative technologies and techniques for Airborne Network Connectivity and Dissemination.</p>
<p>The objective of the BAA is to conceive, develop and demonstrate innovative and affordable technologies that provide agile and secure information transmission, network and dissemination capabilities to airborne platforms that enable the sharing of quality information within resource and policy constraints. The intent is to expand the Global Information grid (GIG) to connect three major domains of warfare: Air, Space, and Terrestrial. The goal is to deliver timely, reliable, and actionable information to war-fighters and systems across the United States Air Force enterprise to support Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Efforts under this program are expected to enable the Air Force to provide a transportable network, flexible enough to communicate with any air, space, or ground asset in the area. The network will provide a beyond line-of-sight (LoS) communications infrastructure that can be packed up and moved in and out of the designated battle-space, enabling the military to have a reliable and secure communications network that extends globally. The network is designed to be flexible enough to provide the right communication and network packages for a specific region, mission, or technology.<br />White papers may describe but are not limited to</p>
<p><br />&bull; Hardware brass-boards and/or software systems development. <br />&bull; Activities for validation with model-based design and simulation.<br />&bull; Demonstration of hardware brass-boards and antenna in-the-loop validation techniques.</p>
<p>Research efforts under this program are expected to result in functional capabilities, concepts, theory, and applications addressing Air Force airborne network connectivity problems. The effectiveness of the developed technologies for potential operational use will be assessed through testing and evaluation activities. Technologies that can be transitioned for operational use are of high interest. Offerors are encouraged to describe the pre-conditions that are necessary for the proposed techniques to work effectively.</p>
<p>Work is encouraged in, but not limited to, these focus areas:</p>
<p>1. Airborne Network Architecture</p>
<p>&bull; Develop network architectures that support self-organizing, self- healing autonomous machine-to- machine data routing and dissemination.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop self-aware/sentient cross-Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layer network communications paradigms that support cooperative learning and reconfiguration-on-the-fly of mobile networks, by sensing and adapting to operational environment and mission requirements.</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrate cooperative wireless network communications that allow nodes in a wireless network to share resources and to cooperatively transmit, providing reliable, robust connectivity via multipath routing.</p>
<p>2. Information Transport Performance Management</p>
<p>&bull; Develop the communications management capabilities to support the management of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) related network and information system and communications resources.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop information management algorithms capable of dynamically requesting data from multiple ISR sensors in order to enhance current capabilities for detecting, locating, identifying, and tracking ground moving targets.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop the mechanisms to enable mission-based priority schemes and assured information delivery techniques supporting the exchange of ISR traffic, as well as other network traffic. Develop metrics such as Kill Chain Reduction, Bandwidth Efficiency, or Network Availability to gauge performance and effects.</p>
<p>3. Integration and Interoperability with the Global Information Grid (GIG)</p>
<p>&bull; Integrate new communications resources available on the ISR platform(s), to enable increased communications capability.</p>
<p>&bull; Study potential ISR collection planning and envisioned dynamic tasking techniques being developed for current and future Air Operations Centers (AOCs). Develop the information management algorithms to ensure they will operate within the constraints of these envisioned collection management techniques.</p>
<p>&bull; In conjunction with the Government, work with the operational community to address Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) issues associated with ISR platform interoperability.</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct airborne flight experiments utilizing multiple ISR assets aimed at demonstrating capabilities for increasing multi-platform interoperability and tracking performance.</p>
<p>4. Advanced Tactical Data Links (ATDL)</p>
<p>Tactical Data Links (TDL) are used in both peace time and combat environments to exchange information such as fixed formatted messages, data, radar tracks, target information, platform status, imagery, free text messaging and command assignments. TDLs provide interoperability, local and global connectivity, and situational awareness to the user when operating under rapidly changing operational conditions. TDLs increase mission effectiveness, providing enhanced situational awareness, positive combat identification of aircraft in the network, correlation of on- and off-board sensor data, and digital machine to machine target and threat information sharing, enabling time critical targeting and other mission assignment tasking. In combat TDLs enable engagement of high-value, time-critical targets in anti-access/area-denial environments. TDLs are used by all Service Theater Command and Control (C2) elements, weapons platforms, and sensors. TDLs include, but are not limited to: Link 16, Link 11, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), Variable Message Format (VMF), Intra-Flight Data Link (IFDL), and other Advanced Tactical Data Link technologies, such as Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT), and Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL).</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct experiments and demonstrations providing validation of critical capabilities and enhancements to the Aerial Layer Network.</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct experiments demonstrating interoperability among Air Force fighter platforms. Provide validation to ensure the Air Force fighter fleet maintains standardization, to develop interoperable data link exchanges.</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct RF in-the-loop experiments to demonstrate ATDL validation and model authentication supporting Global Strike (GS), Global Persistent Attack (GPA), Offensive and Defensive Counterair (OCA and DCA), Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD), and Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) missions.</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrate ATDLs on the fighter fleet to expand Line of Sight (LOS) and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) data link connectivity.</p>
<p>&bull; Model future ATDL concepts for the next-generation conceptual fighter fleet to demonstrate scenario-based mission impact.</p>
<p>ATDL validation activities are encouraged but not required to include the use of AFRL antenna measurement facilities. The AFRL Rome Research Site maintains the largest advanced antenna measurement facilities of its kind in the United States. The facilities support installed antenna measurement on full-scale air-frames and ground vehicles. AFRL has a large inventory of airframes including F-35, all three variants, F-22, F-16, F-15, A-10, and Global Hawk.</p>

<DESC><strong>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /><br /></strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for the <strong>standardization of Insulin Syringes with Needles on or about February 2013,</strong> but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days.<br /><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <br /><br /><strong>Examples</strong> of items being solicited could include, but are not limited to, Sterile, BHP Free plastic, syringes designed specifically for the injection of Insulin with permanently attached needles of gauges 29, 30 and 31 in lengths of 5/16 (8mm) and &frac12; (12.7mm) inch, with barrels clearly marked with both ml and unit capacities for 0.3mL or 30 units, 0.5mL or 50 units, 1.0mL or 100 units graduations for insulin, with clear barrel with bold graduation scale markings and imprinted with medication type to include at a minimum the specific products listed in Technical/Company Requirements, below. <strong>The estimated value of the resultant Incentive Agreement (IA) will be approximately $915,844.90 annually. <br /><br /></strong>NOTE: This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel and standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. <strong>To participate in this Standardization Action (SA) your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor, or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA and a separate commercial agreement with Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products.</strong> The IA resulting from the solicitation is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract.

<a href="mailto:Julie.A.Janus@nasa.gov">Julie A. Janus</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for additional H4RG-10 Sensor Chip Assemblies (SCAs) for the Wide-Field Infrared Survey (WFIRST) project. The Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) is the highest ranked recommendation for a large space mission in the New Worlds, New Horizons (NWNH) in Astronomy and Astrophysics 2010 Decadal Survey.  The most pressing scientific questions in astrophysics today require a very wide-field survey in order to be answered, and existing telescopes such as the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) or the Keck Telescope cannot make these kinds of observations due to their optical designs and narrow fields of view.   The absence of atmospheric distortion and absorption, the darkness of space, and the opportunity for continuous observations enable space-based surveys to go deeper, with more precision and accuracy, than can ever be possible from the ground.  WFIRST will be the most sensitive infrared space telescope designed for precision wide-field survey work, and will produce the most powerful and informative astronomical data set for probing the nature of dark energy, cataloguing the variety of exoplanet systems, and mapping the distribution of matter across cosmic time. The NWNH science goals for WFIRST are quite broad  tiered infrared sky surveys of unprecedented scope and depth; a census of cold (as opposed  to hot) exoplanets using microlensing; measurements of the history of cosmic acceleration using 3 distinct but interlocking methods; a galactic plane survey and a general observation/archival research program.	These very different science goals were brought together by the recent advances in infrared detector technology that makes it possible to launch a wide field instrument system that has a large number of diffraction limited effective pixels in a the focal plane. Recently, WFIRST completed a two year Design Reference Mission (DRM) activity with a Science Definition Team (SDT).	The results presented NASA with two viable mission concepts (DRM 1 and 2).  The DRMs were built upon detector testing results obtained from the Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) Engineering Development Unit (EDU) Detector Module Subassembly, which was acquired under a previous  competitively awarded contract (NASA Contract NNG10FD62C) with Teledyne Scientific and Imaging, LLC (TS&I).	 NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to TS&I for twelve (12) additional H4RG-10 SCAs for the WFIRST Project.   TS&I will provide the materials and labor to deliver the additional H4RG-10 SCAs to be used for testing in the GSFC Detector Characterization Laboratory (DCL), and incorporated into the WFIRST EDU Focal Plane Assembly (FPA).	The period of performance is approximately 36 months for delivery. TS&I is uniquely qualified for this contract not only because of their extensive experience and expertise but also due to the existing hardware (including H4RG-10 SCAs) and infrastructure currently in use by the WFIRST project, and the data already developed from that hardware and infrastructure.	Further, they are the only organization currently qualified to perform the manufacture of the H4RG-10s that enable a WFIRST mission that meets the following requirements which flow from the NWNH goals listed above: 1.	TS&I is the only known provider of the H4RG-10 detector module subassemblies needed for the WFIRST mission.	Based on the responses to the Request for Proposal (RFP) for Contract NNG10FD62C, other viable vendors do not exist to provide detector assembly that meets the mission requirements as defined by the decadal survey. a.	WFIRST Exoplanet science requirements require a  large Field of View (FOV) and high angular resolution for an effective space-based microlensing survey. Hundreds of millions of main sequence source stars with a sampling of 15 minutes or less is required. Also, resolving the motions of the planet host stars of the Galactic bulge require  fine sampling  that only H4RG-10 arrays can enable a FOV that is large enough to produce the statistical sampling needed. b.	WFIRST Dark Energy science requirements require wide-field observation that is more efficiently conducted with H4RG-10 detectors. Dark energy techniques of supernovae type 1a (SNe), galaxy clustering including baryon acoustic oscillations (GC BAO) and redshift space distortions, and weak lensing (WL) will be performed by the WFIRST mission. H4RG-10 detector arrays increase the pixel count and maximize the field of view while simultaneously keeping the pixel sampling at a level needed for the required precision WL measurements. c.	The WFIRST requirement of providing a deep map of the sky at near-infrared wavelengths in both the Galactic plane and in extragalactic fields. H4RG-10s enable these large area surveys improving both the FOV and PSF sampling in each image taken. d.	The WFIRST requirement for the General Observer (GO) Program requires a minimum of ten percent of the primary mission to be dedicated for observations other than those listed above. H4RG-10s enable a wider range of observations, providing better morphological information and larger field coverage. e.	The mission requirements for the WFIRST mission are designed to be met through the coordination of the results of each of these separate areas of inquiry to create an overall product.  Only the H4RG-10 SCA can meet all of these functions with a single type of sensor array. 2.	On August 20, 2012, the GSFC 2011 Strategic Astrophysics Technology (SAT) solicitation proposal was selected, which specifically named TS&I as the provider for the H4RG-10 SCAs.  TS&I has developed the H4RG-10 design, processes, and testing that is the basis of the award along with the existing data by which subsequent testing will conducted.  Changing the detector hardware at this point will moot the testing data already collected. Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source.  However, organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work, should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 3, 2012.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center has a requirement for patient lodging to accommodate Clinical Center patients. The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is America's clinical research hospital and the world's largest hospital dedicated totally to clinical research. Through clinical research, promising discoveries in the laboratory are translated into better health and health care for all. Currently, there are about 1500 clinical research studies in progress here. The NIH CC is a unique facility in that all patients are on a research protocol, over 50% of them are from across the country, and many are here for extended stays. The needs of this type of patient population differ from a community or academic medical center that draws mostly from the local community. Often these patients are alone, may not have many visitors, and/or are without family members for support. Many patients with chronic or acute illnesses have depleted their financial resources, and the cost of travel and lodging causes them additional stress. A positive experience with lodging and accommodations is an important contributor to a patient's overall welfare.
<p>NIH intends to award multiple Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contracts for multiple lodging facilities within a 25 mile radius from the NIH Clinical Center. The Government anticipates the total life of the Contract shall not to exceed 60 months. The base period of performance will be twelve months from the date of award, with options to renew for four additional twelve month periods.</p>
<p>Lodging facilities must meet the following requirements to participate when the solicitation is released in 15 days: 1. Be located within 25 mile radius of the National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda MD. 2. Be compliant with Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990. <br />3. Be compliant with the American with Disability Act and 4. Must provide refrigeration i.e. Kitchenette and/or refrigerator for storing medications or special dietary products must be provided in the room if requested.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. This notice will close fifteen days from its posting. The solicitation will be posted through Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE). The solicitation will be located on Federal Business Opportunities www.fbo.gov.</p>

The CDSP requires that the 25 ft. Guardian Boat be identical to those currently in the fleet, thus maintaining the established configuration. The Naval Special Warfare (NSW) Forces are required to conduct high-speed patrol, assault missions in rivers, harbors, and protected coastal areas within all maritime theaters and at all levels of conflict. NSW Forces require a craft capable of performing in such hostile environments and conditions. The Brunswick 25 ft. Guardian Boat remains the only known boat that meets NSW's minimum requirements. The primary requirement is for a craft forming a single boat unit that is both unsinkable and inseparable. Brunswick has manufactured a boat with the outer hull and inner hull bonded together especially for this purpose.</p>

<DESC>This is an RFI for planning purposes only, as part of a market survey led by PMS-408, EOD/CREW Program Office, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). This is not a Request for Proposal. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.
 
Background: 
The Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) initiative has urgent and compelling operational requirements to counter the threat posed by Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) in order to reduce combat fatalities during Operation New Dawn (OND) (formerly Operation Iraqi Freedom) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). 
PMS 408 EOD/CREW provides the military services with EOD and CREW systems, tools, equipment and information to the threat from Improvised Explosive Devices (IED).
  Various EOD tools and equipment are used to search for, map, identify, investigate, neutralize, and dispose of IEDs on land and in shallow water. The current CREW systems (dismounted systems, mounted systems and semi-permanent geographical area/fixed systems) are designed to combat radio-controlled IEDs.  There are several EOD and CREW system designs in various stages of development, production, fielding, and sustainment.  
 
PMS-408 EOD/CREW is searching for companies that have Non Developmental or Commercial off the Shelf CREW dismounted and mounted systems that are able to counter a range of threats.  The program office will develop its acquisition approach partly based upon the responses to this request for information.
The specific requirements of the systems will be provided through separate correspondence to interested companies through classified channels.  
Notional Approach:  A three phased acquisition approach where: Phase 1 is a comparative test between contractor EDMs provided on bailment with some limited funding provided to vendors for system support during testing; the Government would provide threat scenarios to Industry that would be verified through or by leveraging laboratory testing; Phase 2 would be a down select to procure up to 43 dismounted and 22 mounted EDMs and fielding prototypes on a FFP contract option (awards may be made to multiple and/or different vendors) as soon as possible with a delivery goal of September 2013.
  Phase 2 could also potentially include a CPFF option for additional development to get systems to meet full requirements; Phase 3 could either be a FFP contract option or a separate contract to procure an additional ~1000 units for USN, USAF and USMC.  Specifically the PMS 408 program office is looking for companies that have the ability and would be willing to deliver three (3) systems on bailment to the Government with some limited funding provided to the contractor for systems support during testing in the February 2013 timeframe.  Submission of just one variant will be considered. The systems would undergo Government testing.  Given the timeframe, PMS-408 is interested in systems that are nearly ready to field and would only require minimal changes to meet the requirements provided through separate correspondence (SEPCOR).
Qualified respondents need to have demonstrated past performance in systems engineering and technical expertise with hardware, firmware, software and technical data required for manufacturing, production, maintenance, and support of CREW systems.
  Qualified respondents need to demonstrate the ability to provide engineering service support, depot maintenance support, spare parts and consumables, engineering change proposals, technology insertion and refresh, obsolescence management support, logistics management information, and demilitarization and disposal of the proposed systems. Qualified respondents need to demonstrate the ability to fabricate an operational system and have the ability and production capacity to rapidly ramp up a production line.
 
Requested Information:
Respondent is requested to provide information on the following:
 
a)         Industry's ability and interest in providing the Government three (3) NDI CREW systems on bailment by February 2013 for each variant for a competitive down select; funding would be provided for system support during testing;
b)         Define how long would it take Industry to deliver 43 dismounted crew systems based upon April 2013 contract award of Phase 2 effort.
c)         Define how long would it take Industry to deliver 22 mounted crew systems based upon April 2013 contract award of  Phase 2 effort;
d)         Identification of risks and the mitigation plans of long lead material associated with the delivery of 43 dismounted crew and 22 mounted crew systems respectively based on April 2013 contract award date for Phase 2 effort. 
e)         Industry's interest and concerns in pricing 43 Dismounted and 22 Mounted EDMs on a FFP basis. 
f)          Industry's interest and concerns in pricing 360 Dismounted and 150 Mounted EDMs on a FFP basis. 
g)         The ability to meet Priority 1 &amp; Level 1 requirements provided SEPCOR with the EDMs delivered in the February 2013 timeframe; if unable to meet requirements how much additional development would be required?
h)        The ability to meet the Priority 2 &amp; Level 2 requirements provided SEPCOR with the EDMs delivered in the February 2013 timeframe; if unable to meet requirements how much additional development would be required?  How long would it take to deliver systems meeting Level 2 requirements?
i)          The ability to meet the Priority 3 &amp; Level 3 requirements provided SEPCOR with the EDMs delivered in the February 2013 timeframe; if unable to meet requirements how much additional development would be required? How long would it take to deliver systems meeting Level 3 requirements?
j)          The ability to meet the Priority 4 &amp; Level 4 requirements provided SEPCOR with the EDMs delivered in the February 2013 timeframe; if unable to meet requirements how much additional development would be required? How long would it take to deliver systems meeting Level 4 requirements?
k)         Identification of risks and the mitigation plans for not being able to meet any of the requirements provided SEPCOR;
l)          The ability to meet current Manufacturing Readiness Level 8 for the system proposed and ability to rapidly ramp up a production line;
m)       Manufacturing capability to include: manufacturing/assembly location(s), available floor space, production capacity/throughput, equipment/tooling, and availability of skilled workers; 
n)        Relevant certifications (e.g., ISO 9000);
o)         Industry's ability to provide Field Service Representative Support (CONUS and OCONUS);
p)         Recommendations of how Industry can help the Government efficiently and effectively execute the production activities.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command (ACC)-Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) Huachuca Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Electronic Proving Ground (EPG) on Fort Huachuca, Arizona, and in accordance with FAR subpart 6.3, intends to execute a Firm Fixed-Price contract under Other Than Full and Open Competition, Sole Source basis to Aeroflex High Speed Test Solutions, Inc.  The Government intends to procure items with the following salient characteristics: <br>  <br> Portable Broadband Signal Analyzer (BSA) System with the following features: <br> 20 MHz - 6 GHz Tunable RF Receiver  <br> 40 MHz Instantaneous Bandwidth  <br> Digital Tuners (21MHz to 41 kHz)  <br> Preselect and IF filtering  <br> 32 GB Signal Capture RAM  <br> Integrated Monitor, Keyboard, and Mouse  <br> Integrated GPS Receiver  <br> 1TB Removable Data Storage Drive  <br> 60 GB Removable Solid State System Drive <br>  <br> Standard Graphical User Interface (GUI) software package for BSA Analyzer/Recorder controls and basic analysis. Controls include RF and input power, signal recording into memory, and signal previewing from stored data in memory. GUI includes spectrum, time, waterfall, and parameter strip chart plotting. Signal parameters from ACPR and other optional analysis software modules can be plotted on the strip chart and logged to data files. ACPR software application includes channel power, band power, and adjacent channel power measurements. Recorded data can be reviewed and saved to mass storage devices. <br>  <br> File-based version of BSA signal analysis software. Has all signal analysis software functionality and accepts all optional signal analysis software modules. Loads and analyzes data from files.  <br>  <br> Modulation Domain Signal analysis software for simultaneous signal data, amplitude, frequency, and phase plotting in time domain. A frequency selective filter can be applied prior to signal demodulation and plotting, allowing selective bands to be processed. Cursors allow measurements of amplitude, frequency, and phase. Plots include signal vs. time, signal envelope vs. time, frequency vs. time, and phase vs. time. User selectable time durations can be plotted, as well as the amplitude, power, frequency and phase values on a GUI window. These can be strip charted to measure the signal dynamics and statistics. Other plots include time-time raster of any of the demodulated data formats (raw, AM, FM and PM), and signal spectrum.  <br>  <br> Scanning Spectrum Analyzer (SSA): Takes Time Domain data and produces a FFT spectrum trace from each individual sub-band of the user defined passband (i.e. 30 MHz - 2 GHz) and stitches them together taking into account gain differences between the multiple sub-bands.

<a href="mailto:allison.griffin@us.army.mil">ACC-APG - Natick (PADDS)</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) in Natick, MA, is conducting a market survey for technical information from US and/or foreign vendors on packaging of small food and water items for dispersion from a cargo parachute system onto an active population. This is intended to provide the United States with a rapid humanitarian assistance response capability, allowing the US to assist populations in need within 24 hours of a natural disaster.  NSRDEC is currently investigating a humanitarian airdrop system to deliver food and water directly onto a population in need with minimal to no risk of human injury. This system utilizes a flexible container bag that falls under a parachute to a pre-determined altitude, normally in the range of 1,000 feet to 5,000 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). At this altitude, the container bag tips over and dumps out the contents. The contents then free fall to the ground. The system is targeted so that the contents will disperse directly onto the population.   This market survey is looking for food and water packaging methods with the following characteristics: * Ability to contain or package a US Agency for International Development (USAID) bar or a 4-oz water packet * Minimal to no risk of injury if the item impacts a person in free fall * Aversion to clumping when released from the aerial delivery system in large quantities (1,000+ items) * Dense enough to be contained in the airdrop container and meet minimum airdrop requirements * Ability to be mass produced at a low cost  The USAID bar weighs approximately 55 grams and has dimensions of 2.5 quote mark x1.5 quote mark x0.5 quote mark . The water packet contains 4.227 ounces of water and is approximately 6 quote mark x3.75 quote mark x0.5 quote mark . The packaging for the food item does not need to be the same as the packaging for the water item. However, both of these items should fall at the same descent rate, so that after dispersing from the aerial delivery system and falling to the ground, both will share the same dispersion footprint.   Minimal to no injury risk is determined as keeping the maximum peak impact force at or below 3,100 Newtons (~700 lbs). A decelerated descent rate, impact attenuation or cushioning or other impact reduction methods are within the trade space.   Clumping has been seen in thin, flat packets when dispersed in large quantities. Mechanisms within the aerial delivery system have been tested, but are unable to fully disperse the items. If items clump together, they fall faster and impact harder, normally reaching well above the 3,100 Newton (~700 lbs) impact limit. This also reduces the survivability of the items.  In order for an aerial delivery system to be deployed off the ramp of a cargo aircraft, it must meet a minimum loading requirement. Based on this requirement and the size of the system, a starting guideline for the item density would be greater than 14 lbs/ft3. This number is not to be taken as a hard requirement, but rather a guideline to indicate that large items with very low density are not likely feasible.  The aerial delivery system is intended to be used in a mass resupply scenario. This requires thousands, if not millions, of food and water packages to be produced and stored, ready for immediate use. It is important that these items can be produced on a large scale at low cost.   Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government.  All interested firms, regardless of size are encouraged to respond to this request for information.  It should be noted that this is a market survey and not a pre-solicitation notice.  Nothing shall be construed herein or through the market survey process to commit or obligate the Government to further action as a result of this market survey.  Firms responding to this market survey shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information, and all information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the submitter.

<p>The Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) are issuing a source sought notice to identify potential sources within the greater Boston area / Boston Metrowest area / Boston-Worcester Metropolitan areas that can perform high-resolution imaging (e.g. MRI, CT or biplane fluoroscopy) of the lower limb.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>NSRDEC is interested in exploring the potential link between lower limb anatomy and biomechanical profiles during load carriage. To do so, we need to obtain high-resolution imaging of the lower limb, for between 12 and 20 participants, to integrate with our planned internal biomechanical human use research studies. We prefer scans of a loaded limb, but will also consider images an unloaded limb, as well. Our end goal is to integrate joint kinematic and kinetic data with anatomical indices obtained from high-resolution imagining of the leg in order to investigate how biomechanical profiles are potentially influenced by lower limb anatomy during load carriage. We plan to identify the anatomical indices ourselves and potential sources are only sought for collection of the high-resolution images.</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice only.
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>The Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is issuing a source sought notice to identify potential technologies that can measure the pressure and/or force applied to the shoulders/upper back/lower back region of Soldiers as a result of wearing torso-borne military equipment.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>NSRDEC is interested in systematically manipulating the distribution of torso-borne loads, which are typically borne by the shoulder and upper back of Soldiers. We are also interested in determining an optimal distribution of the load on the torso. To do so, we need to obtain validated and reliable technology that will allow us to measure and quantify (in terms of pressure or force) the distribution of the load on or across the Soldier's torso. We prefer the technology be pliable allowing it to be placed comfortably under the military equipment on the surface of the torso and multiple sizes are also preferred. This technology should be durable, comfortable, and engineered such that it may be worn for long periods of time (i.e. 2 hour march). Continuous data capture from as little as 10 minutes to as long as 120 min is required. Our research goal is to determine if there is an optimal distribution of the load on the torso that results in an increase in performance and comfort. Sources are only sought for the available technology that would allow us to measure/quantify the pressure and/or force being applied to the body by the torso-borne equipment worn. NSRDEC will then utilize the technology within an internal human use approved protocol(s).</p>
<p>Period of Performance: 01 January 2013 - 15 April 2013. The technology provider shall provide services that include:</p>
<p>1. Detailed specifications of technology and any known limitations. <br />2. Ease of Use: The NSRDEC reserves the right to evaluate the performance of the technology, via live demonstration, and will also examine the ease of use of the system (hardware and software) prior to award. The live demonstration, if required, will take place at the US Army Soldiers System Command, Natick, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Parameter Recommendation:</p>
<p>1. Safe to place on human subjects.<br />2. Easily and comfortably placed between the upper body of the human and the military equipment being worn (i.e. load carriage equipment, body armor, etc.).<br />3. Ability to synchronize data collection with other devices and data collection software.<br />4. Capable of detecting a pressure range that would be sensitive enough to measure the distribution of torso-borne loads weighing up to 120 lbs. <br />5. Multiple sizes of sensors are preferred.<br />6. Comfortable to wear for the user for prolonged periods (3 hours).<br />7. Sufficient sampling rate (at least 20 Hz) for continuous data capture of dynamic loads.</p>
<p>RESPONSES</p>
<p>All interested firms and manufacturers, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information. Information submissions should include available technology, product literature, and relevant company background/experience. Please provide product pricing as part of the information submission. <br />Information submissions must be received by 01 January 2013. Responses to this notice should be directed to karen.n.gregorczyk.civ@mail.mil. Responses should include information on their product(s) and how they might address the Military requirement.

<RESPDATE>112912
<CONTACT>LStanley LStanley, Contracting Officer, Email PSB3@bpd.treas.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND COMMENTS FROM INDUSTRY.
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is soliciting information to assist the CFPB in devising the most appropriate strategy for cloud infrastructure and System Administration support services. The CFPB is building a sophisticated portfolio of technologies that will enable its business units to easily and independently access and use information resources. Some of the supported solutions range from content management, document management, records management, knowledge management, data management and analytics, disaster recovery, and enterprise-wide security operations. Any vendor selected for this work, as part of a solicitation process, will be required to provide coordinated support across multivendor platforms, technologies, and geographical boundaries within the United States. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposals (RFP), Invitation for Bid (IFB) or as an obligation on the part of CFPB to acquire any services. The Government reserves the right to determine how it should proceed as a result of this notice.</p>
<p>The CFPB does not maintain its own data center. All systems are in a co-location, cloud environment or with managed service providers. The CFPB is seeking an environment with rapid elasticity where resources can be rapidly and flexibly provisioned automatically, to provision computing capabilities as needed.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The CFPB's purpose in providing an opportunity for industry to comment and submit information is to identify potential vendors that can meet the CFPB's need in the Cloud arena. The eventual awardee will identify areas of opportunities for improvement to the current environment; and provide recommendations for alternatives to ensure the success of any solicitation effort. The awardee will be responsible for working in conjunction with CFPB's Technology staff to propose and support a cloud model based on direct experience in large scale cloud infrastructure, data and application management. The awardee will be responsible for the Cloud infrastructure design and implementation of required services, operational support for all CFPB applications in the Cloud, providing advice to CFPB on optimal cloud operational practices, and recommendations for deployment architecture and solution alternatives. In addition, the contractor will be responsible for the implementation of day to day and emergency procedures, deploying and monitoring applications, providing performance reporting and metrics, and ensuring reliable, responsive operation through both proactive planning and rapid situational response. The CFPB believes industry feedback is important, and is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, capitalizing on advancements in technology and benefits, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with any future solicitation.</p>
<p>Therefore, the primary purpose of this RFI and comments is to: <br />(1) Conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 to determine common and customary industry Cloud practices;<br />(2) gather information, comments, and suggestions from prospective vendors; (3) identify and attract potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities and experience to meet CFPB's cloud requirements and objectives;<br />(4) assist the CFPB in developing its cloud computing strategy to include determining the appropriate contract type, and applicable terms and conditions of a prospective solicitation; and <br />(5) garner responses to specific issues as delineated in the questions to below:</p>
<p>RESPONSE CONTENT AND QUESTIONS FOR RESPONDEES</p>
<p>Given the needs defined above, the CFPB has identified the following content and questions which should be addressed in the RFI response.</p>

<p>7)Describe your company's experience with application development support and maintenance in the cloud using various life cycle methodologies.</p>
<p>8)What experience does your company have in analyzing capacity, availability, and resource utilization trends, forecasting future requirements and recommending solutions to support infrastructure resource management decisions?</p>
<p>9)Describe your company's approach for transitioning physical environments to virtual environments.</p>
<p>10)Describe your firm's approach in designing, implementing and managing remote access in the cloud.</p>
<p>11)Describe your company's experience with Email as a Service (EaaS)? Please explain in detail.</p>
<p>12)Discuss how your company minimizes the chance of a security breach in the environment you manage.</p>
<p>13)What is your company's experience in Database administration support including system architecture and data model reviews, installation of enterprise database software, data migration and database conversion, performance and tuning, space management and capacity planning, database audits and security control, database cloning and replication , and backup and recovery?</p>
<p>14)Which contract type most closely resembles the typical commercial contract used for cloud support service (i.e. firm fixed contract, time and material, etc.)?</p>

Linguist shall perform annotations of reports selected from VINCI to identify linguistic expressions that indicate ambiguity, including negation, uncertainty, and contradiction. The Linguist will also assist in manuscript writing.  The period of performance for this service shall not exceed one (1) year from the time of award.

All interested parties should submit a word version of your resume or curriculum vitae to: ashante.booker@va.gov by 4:00 pm PST, Tuesday November 20, 2012.

Also, please limit your resume or CSV to one (1) page. This is not a solicitation. The purpose of this notice is to seek sources and represents market segment research. Please do not include pricing.
Project Description: VINCI is an initiative to improve researchers' access to VA data and to facilitate the analysis of those data while ensuring Veterans' privacy and data security.
Data
VINCI is a partner with the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) and hosts all data available through CDW as well as some unique data. Example data sets are:
"	CDW extractions from VistA 
"	MedSAS in SAS and SQL 
"	DSS in SAS and SQL 
"	TIU 
"	Radiology notes 
Applications
VINCI hosts many types of analytical applications. Generally, these applications will run much faster in the VINCI server environment than on your local computers. We attempt to update to the latest versions. Example applications are: 
"	SAS Grid 
"	Stata MP 
"	SPSS 
VINCI Workspace
Researchers will access the data along with the tools for reporting and analysis in a secure Workspace. The Workspace is provisioned so that each study has its own project site where multiple people can collaborate using a common set of software tools and files. VINCI staff can also provide an isolated virtual machine for specific development activities. VINCI has a common access point using Remote Desktop Connection to connect from anywhere within the VA network.
Projects in Development: VINCI staff are partnering with research groups such as the Consortium for Health Informatics Research (CHIR) to bring new types of data and new applications to VINCI. The focus is on structured data derived from text using natural language processing. Funded by HSR&D and OI&T, VINCI functions in conjunction with the Office of Informatics and Analytics (VHA OIA).

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin">While the recent emphasis on distracted driving has brought the issue to the forefront, little is known about the role distraction plays in pedestrian-involved motor vehicle crashes. Over the last decade, there has been tremendous growth in the use of portable electronic devices, such as cell phones, iPads, iPods, and Kindles, by both drivers and pedestrians. While the National Occupant Protection Use Survey includes a measure of driver hand-held cell phone use, there is no similar measure for pedestrians. This project meshes the initiative on distracted driving and the NHTSA's focus on pedestrian safety to investigate the extent to which electronic devices are used by pedestrians and drivers and the magnitude of the involvement of electronic device use in pedestrian-involved motor vehicle conflicts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /></span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin"><br />The goal of this project is to determine if electronic device use by pedestrians and drivers significantly impacts pedestrian safety.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first steps in determining if there is problem are to (1) conduct a literature review of studies that have investigated pedestrian and driver electronic device use, and (2) conduct naturalistic observations to quantify portable electronic use by pedestrians and drivers when interacting. Ideally, the naturalistic observations would occur in several cities with each city contributing multiple observation sites. An optional task (after accessing its feasibility and the availability of data) would be to analyze pedestrian-motor vehicle crash data to quantify the extent to which electronic devices are involved and to determine crash typology. </span></p>

<DESC>&nbsp;This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of this Notice is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The NHTSA welcomes Corporate Capability Statements from all individuals and organizations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The NHTSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NHTSA's use of such information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of NHTSA's evaluation of the information received.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result of this Notice, the NHTSA may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, should such a requirement fail to materialize, no basis for claims against the NHTSA shall arise as a result of a response to this Notice.
<p>&nbsp;The concerted attention directed at occupant protection has substantially raised the level of seat belt use and child restraint use by the public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet further improvement will be increasingly difficult to attain as the "easy" gains have been accomplished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The injury prevention community must now dig deeper for solutions as remaining barriers to safety will be more resistant to programmatic influences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Up-to-date information is essential to plot the direction of future activity that will achieve the more difficult gains that await. NHTSA has administered the Motor Vehicle Occupant Safety Survey (MVOSS) periodically since 1994 to obtain up-to-date information in the area of occupant protection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most recent was conducted in 2007.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This project would administer the next MVOSS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The objective of this project is to collect data that will provide a status report on the public's attitudes, knowledge, and behavior related to occupant protection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As with the previous MVOSSs, it will involve administration of two questionnaires administered to independently drawn samples, with one questionnaire focusing on seat belt use and the other on child restraint use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, NHTSA has decided to institute major changes in the methodology, which formerly was strictly telephone survey.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NHTSA has decided to change to a multi-mode approach that emphasizes Web-based administration but also offers mail and telephone response in follow-up contacts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The sampling frame would be address-based.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The project will include making revisions to the 2007 MVOSS questionnaires, adapting the MVOSS to the new modes, and pilot testing.</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.<br />The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources: (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantage businesses and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code (622110 with a size standard $34.5M), should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>2. Notice Information</p>
<p>a. Background:<br />NHLBI has been developing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and applying these methods to patients with acute presentations of ischemic heart disease. Many technical developments have been achieved in making cardiovascular MRI more feasible, specifically advances in how to acquire cine MRI, infarct images, T2 weighted images, and perfusion images have all been achieved over the past 8 years. In addition, substantial advances have been made in developing methods for quantifying myocardial perfusion at rest or during stress. Many of these advances have been made possible through image acceleration techniques related to parallel imaging methods. Three major breakthroughs consist of the following: <br />1) Fat water separated imaging: Developed imaging method for generating separate images of water and fat which is used for (a) imaging fibro&#8208;fatty infiltration, (b) improved tissue characterization and mass characterization, (c) reduced artifacts related to fat, (d) improved imaging of the pericardium and other thin walled structures in close proximity to fat.<br />2) Viability: Developed an improved free breathing motion corrected real&#8208;time late gadolinium enhancement protocol that may be used in patients with difficulty breath&#8208;holding and/or with arrhythmias.<br />3) Extra&#8208;cellular volume (ECV) fraction and T1&#8208;mapping: Developed parametric mapping of T1 and ECV that is useful in tissue characterization, and for the detection diffuse processes such as edema and fibrosis that are challenging to detect and characterize with conventional late gadolinium enhancement.</p>
<p>b. Purpose and Objectives:<br />This project will focus primarily in two areas: 1) advanced characterization of myocardial tissue and the relationship between these characteristics and disease processes; and 2) of exploring the role of quantitative MRI measures of myocardial perfusion at rest and during stress.</p>
<p>Thus, the proposed project will have the following specific aims:<br />1. To improve the ability of MRI to differentiate acute and chronic myocardial infarction.<br />2. To develop more robust MRI methods to determine the ischemic myocardium at risk associated with acute myocardial infarction.<br />3. To characterize fat and water in myocardium and other tissue, particularly in specific cardiomyopathies.<br />4. To use T1 mapping to characterize the extracellular volume fraction and diffuse myocardial fibrosis in various cardiomyopathies.<br />5. To use MRI to predict which patients will respond better to specific interventions (e.g. valve replacement, transmyocardial laser therapy).<br />c. Project Requirements: <br />A. General Requirements<br />1. Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services (except as otherwise specified within) and perform the work set forth below.<br />2. All work under this contract shall be monitored by the Project Officer, whose position is defined elsewhere in this contract.<br />B. Specific Requirements<br />1.

<DESC>1. The US Army Engineering and Support Center in Huntsville (CEHNC), is issuing this sources sought in order to perform market research primarily to determine if firms possess the capability to execute the requirements of an anticipated formal solicitation with a estimated contractual capacity of $400-800M. This sources sought is not a REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. Therefore, we invite any size business concerns to provide a capability statement in response to this requirement. This announcement does not obligate the Government to award a contract nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any preparation costs. <br /><br />2. The mission of the DoD High Performance Computing (HPC) Modernization Program (HPCMP) is to accelerate technology development and transition into superior defense capabilities through the strategic application of high performance computing, networking, and computational expertise.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION W23MYC-LIMS RFI_2012 A. In conducting market research analyses, this is a sources sought/request for information synopsis for information and planning purposes only, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. No contract will be awarded as a result of this sources sought synopsis. No reimbursement will be made for any cost associated with providing information in response to this synopsis. The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) is soliciting information on behalf of the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) from potentially qualified businesses. The gist of the proposed requirement follows: 1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), located on Fort Detrick, Maryland currently faces a critical capability shortfall with respect to its ability to manage information generated by increasingly advanced scientific instrumentation. The high content data generated by scientific studies, in combination with information assurance concerns that prevent networking of data-generated instrumentation, is preventing proper archiving and sharing of information. The impact on scientific productivity is direct and detrimental. This document outlines the requirements for a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), inclusive of technical, functional and regulatory compliance aspects. Additionally, project archetypes are used to demonstrates the potential utility of a LIMS system through illustration of the typical studies performed at USAMRIID, the inter-Divisional collaboration involved, and the exchange of information that is required. 2.0 PURPOSE AND SCOPE Current Situation and Objectives The mission of USAMRIID is to conduct basic and applied research on biological threats, resulting in medical solutions for the Soldier. The core competency of USAMRIID is working safely and securely with dangerous pathogens in biocontainment, using the unique laboratory facilities available in the institute. The state of the art in biological science and biodefense research increasingly incorporates and relies upon high-content data-generating instrumentation that enable biological systems to be examined in increasingly complex and comprehensive ways. This instrumentation and the information technology which supports it represents a tremendous challenge in data management. Additionally, DoD security requirements are often incompatible with the software and operating systems required to operate the instruments and analyses, causing a decentralized operating environment where each lab contains many data silos. The downstream effect of this is that scientists are burdened with integration of datasets from disparate functional areas, manual execution of downstream analyses and manual data management. The absence of an integrated network and information management system for instrumentation is having tangible and measurable impacts on the rate of progress of research and collaboration. The execution of this proposal would create a system in which a project can be managed effectively across multiple functional areas, deliver workflow tasks to production scientists and technicians, report status and results to scientists and program managers, and reduce the amount of administrative burden on USAMRIID personnel so more resources can be spent executing research. Additionally, the tracking and reporting functionalities will be critical to certification standards like Good Laboratory Practice and the International Standards Organization and the portal dashboard interface will bring new tools for collaboration within the institute. The physical limitations of a secondary network are being addressed in two initiatives: research network intrinsic to the design for the new RIID facility and the research network pilot designed to cover the existing RIID facilities. We have also recently finished the cabling and hardware infrastructure requirements to connect the Genomics and Toxicology divisions later referred to as the pilot stakeholders for this project. The physical limitations of connectivity between the functional areas have been removed or are in the process of being removed but scientists are still burdened with integration of datasets from disparate functional areas, manual execution of downstream analyses and manual data management. Operation Policies and Constraints The requirements listed below include regulatory compliance related to information technology, intellectual property, quality management and information assurance as defined by the Code of Federal Regulations, DoD, DA, FDA and CDC regulations, as well as certification standards defined by the International Standards Organization. &bull; Address major capability gaps identified within USAMRIID related to: o Greater transparency of research projects and their status. o Improved knowledge-sharing (technical &amp; administrative). o Improved communication and teaming. o Avoidance of redundant data exchanges between offices and erroneous data. o Replacement of inadequately defined paper-based processes with automated processes that would reduce the administrative burden on investigators. &bull; Requirements o The System must require user/password based authentication. o The System must secure data at multiple levels with a robust roles and rights implementation. o The system must be able to reference project metadata and other information stored in the Institute project management information system of record. o The System must be compliant with, or reconciled with, guidance regarding intellectual property and scientific documentation as expressed in AR27-60 (Intellectual Property). o The System must be compliant with Section 508 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act (amended 1998). o The system must address HIPAA concerns with safeguarding human results in accordance with AR 600-110, 45 CFR Part 160, and Subparts A and E of Part 164. o Any data collected using ELN/LIMS for GLP studies needs to be managed so that it will also be 21 CFR Part 58 and 21 CFR Part 11 compliant. o Any data generated using ELN/LIMS for a GLP studies needs to be attributable in order to be compliant with 21 CFR Part 58 and 21 CFR Part 11. o The System should meet the Information Assurance system security objectives as described in Section 2.4, "Security and Regulatory Compliance". &bull; Future Capabilities o CAC based authentication. o Ability to incorporate with BioBanking technology. Proposed System Overview The diagram above provides an overview of the proposed system. On the right is a representation of the physical infrastructure via different functional areas within the institute including but not limited to those presented. The containment suites represented here as a BSL-4 also include BSL-3 laboratories. In all cases each laboratory and or functional area will have organic computing assets and instrumentation connected via a research network to servers located currently at the NEC (Future location in the new RIID server room). The system will leverage the Information Services Office (ISO) initiative to provide a data backup plan for the research network. The left side of the diagram represents the proposed software solution. The system will gather data from multiple disparate systems and transform the data and metadata into a common format for storage in a relational database. Additionally, the system will digitize notebook entries, gather data and run status information directly, provide analytical tools, provide customizable workflow, automate downstream analyses and provide sample management capabilities. Bio-Banking shown here should be a capability and not a requirement of the system. Through portal views users of the system at this level will provide real-time access to direct and complete research. The views will be customized by roles and rights to provide granularity based on business requirements. Following this methodology project managers, division chiefs, auditors, command staff, etc will have access to the data across a functional area, project, or institute as directed by business requirements. Customers LIMS customers will include the following: &bull; USAMRIID End User: The intent of LIMS is to make the daily life of the end user scientist simpler by providing a single gateway for access to all information related to their research and the research performed by intramural collaborators. This will reduce the administrative burden on the end user, resulting in more time to focus on research and more efficient exchange of information, enabling more rapid and effective progress. &bull; USAMRIID Managers: Managers should be able to access information in LIMS related to their organizational unit and personnel in real-time, in order to make informed decisions. &bull; USAMRIID Commander: The Commander and his Executive Team are responsible for the institute and require timely access to information provided by LIMS needed to make informed decisions at both a tactical and strategic level. &bull; Customers/Sponsors: The customers and sponsors that fund research at USAMRIID are demanding increasing accountability for performance, schedule, funding, and deliverables. LIMS will provide accountability for this information by enabling program managers and the office of Business Plans &amp; Programs to have greater visibility on project progress. The major customers include the following: o Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA): This is USAMRIID&rsquo;s main customer, and accounts for approximately 70% of the institute&rsquo;s funding. DTRA is a Defense-Wide organization responsible for management of the Chemical &amp; Biological Defense Program (CBDP) Science &amp; Technology (S&amp;T) portfolio. o Other Customers: These are other federal agencies, companies, and other research organizations that fund research at USAMRIID. They are also demanding greater accountability for execution of research projects and funding, including receiving invoices as a condition of payment. 3.0 REQUIREMENTS USAMRIID requires the vendor to perform requirements gathering, assistance with system design, installation of the software and supporting databases, implementation and integration, testing of one use case, and training of USAMRIID staff for users and administrators of the system.

<p>The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone set aside, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), or Small Business set aside. The estimated value of this procurement is between $200,000.00 and $400,000.00. The small business size standard for NAICS 336611 is less than 1,000 employees. The acquisition is for installation of a fused step-down transformer (contractor provided) and an Automatic Bus Transfer (ABT) switch (provided as Government Furnished Equipment) for the Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) Fire Fighting System onboard all 14 U.S. Coast Guard 210' A &amp; B Class Cutters at multiple vessel locations within the continental U.S. The prototype installation is the only scheduled period of performance at this time. Period of performance start date for the prototype is expected to begin on or about 10 June 2013 and end on or about 14 June 2013. Upon completion of the prototype installation the COR will work with the Contractor to develop a schedule of dates and locations to accomplish the remaining installations.</p>
<p>The scope of this acquisition is to install a fused step-down transformer and an Automatic Bus Transfer (ABT) switch for the Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) Fire Fighting System as shown on Coast Guard drawings to be provided. This installation will provide the AFFF Fire Fighting System with dual power sources. The Contractor shall provide and install all equipment (including the step-down transformer), mounting foundations, materials, labor and hardware (with the exception of the ABT switch that is Government Furnished Equipment) to complete the transformer and ABT switch installation as shown on the Coast Guard drawings and in accordance with TP S9324-AJ-MMO-A10.</p>
<p>All welding and brazing shall be accomplished by trained welders, who have been certified by the applicable regulatory code performance qualification procedures. At the present time, the acquisition is expected to be issued as a small business set aside.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 19.1305, if your firm is HUBZone certified or FAR 19.1405, if your firm is a SDVOSB and intends to submit an offer for this acquisition, please respond by email to Emily Clark at Emily.L.Clark@uscg.mil. Questions may also be referred to Emily Clark at the email address and by phone at (757) 628-4652. In your response, please include the following: (a) positive statement of your intent to submit a bid for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and phone numbers; (c) past performance references with points of contact and phone numbers. At least two (2) references are requested, but more are desirable. If two companies are planning to conduct business as a Joint Venture or any other type of teaming agreement they shall provide past performance on projects of similar scope that they have performed together as a Joint Venture. Providing individual past performance documentation from each company on separate projects where the two did not work together is not considered to be sufficient past performance. A Joint Venture that cannot provide this requested information will not be considered to have sufficient documentation needed to evaluate past performance as an evaluation factor. Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HUBZone set aside or SDVOSB set aside, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total HUBZone set aside or 52.219-27 Notice of Total SDVOSB set aside will apply.</p>
<p>Interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) as prescribed in FAR Clause 52.232-33. Your response is required by 2:00 p.m. EST, 28 November 2012. All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone or SDVOSB set aside. Failure to submit all information requested may result in a small business set aside. A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone or SDVOSB set aside will be posted on FBO website at https://www.fbo.gov/.</p>

<p>(2) Provide RCC's to assistance in defining the marine's individual goals for recovery, rehabilitation, and reintegration; Identify and understand the services and resources needed to achieve the marine's defined goals; Develop and successfully execute the marine's Comprehensive Recovery Plan, an individual roadmap to reach their set recover and transition goals; Liaison with WWII regiment personnel, government and non-government agencies and Marine Corps WWR personnel to ensure the integrity of the program and develop quality assurance standards.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this RFI shall not exceed ten (10) pages, including cover letter, discussion and contact information. Subject response must contain: (1) Capability statement sufficient to demonstrate performance acumen directly related to the objectives stated above; (2) Three (3) Citations of any current or past customers (i.e. within in the past two (2) years) to include contract number, point of contact, telephone number or e-mail address; (3) Link to the respondent's General Services Administration (GSA) schedule or attached file of same, if applicable; and (4) Other material relevant to establishing the core competencies of the firm. Please identify Large/Small Business size status along with a point of contact, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, business size, taxpayer identification number, DUNS number, and CAGE Code.</p>

<DESC>SUBJECT: Request for Information on Space Based Environmental Monitoring (SBEM) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) Concepts <br />1. The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Directorate of Development Planning (XR), Los Angeles Air Force Base, California, is requesting information in direct support of the on-going SBEM Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) being led by Headquarters Air Force Space Command (HQ AFSPC). The purpose of this market research is to collect information regarding several aspects of SBEM sensors and capabilities in support of the SBEM AoA. To provide mission context for this RFI, the AoA is primarily focused on addressing the SBEM capabilities identified below in the FY2025 time-frame. Note that for capability (c) below (Ocean Surface Vector Winds), the AoA is considering potential solutions as early as FY2015. For interested vendors, performance metrics for each of these capabilities can be made available via classified e-mail by contacting the technical points of contact identified below.
<p>a) Cloud Characterization <br />b) Theater Weather Imagery<br />c) Ocean Surface Vector Winds <br />d) Ionospheric Density <br />e) Snow Depth <br />f) Soil Moisture <br />g) Equatorial Ionospheric Scintillation <br />h) Tropical Cyclone Intensity <br />i) Sea Ice Characterization <br />j) Auroral Characterization <br />k) LEO Energetic Charged Particle Characterization <br />l) Electric Field.<br />2. Specific topics requested include: <br />a) Payload Rideshare Opportunities: The identification of viable opportunities and plausible business cases for SBEM sensors to be hosted on planned spacecraft launches (Government and/or commercial) into relevant SBEM sensor orbits. Any hosted sensor concepts identified must contribute toward the satisfaction or augmentation of one or more of the capability gaps provided above. <br />b) Alternative Acquisition Approaches: Provide instances where alternative space system acquisition approaches and acquisition best practices have been successfully implemented in the past or for on-going space system programs, resulting in reduced program cost, streamlined acquisition schedules, and acceptable levels of risk. Where possible, provide specific quantified data regarding cost or schedule savings achieved. Of particular interest are disaggregated architectural approaches, rapid deployable space concepts, and potential commercial source data procurements in accordance with appropriate data purchase and quality of service agreements. <br />c) Commercial and International Partnerships: Identify strategies that would utilize commercial and/or international vendors and agencies to deliver weather information products and data / data sets directly to the USG. These approaches could include joint ventures to procure space weather systems, or innovative data sharing agreements that could conceivably reduce the level of space-based weather collection required. Respondents should address potential Information Assurance for commercial and international partnerships.<br />d) Ground System Improvements: Provide technical descriptions and associated cost / schedule estimates of potential ground system improvements that could contribute toward the satisfaction or augmentation of the previously identified capability gaps. Potential focus areas include data processing, exploitation, data sharing and mission management. Innovations in net-ready, open standards, service oriented architecture capabilities and associated technology and infrastructure requirements would be considered. <br />e) Non-Material Solutions (NMS): Non-material solutions (e.g., solutions that do not require the development of a US Government space-based weather system) that could credibly contribute toward or augment the satisfaction of one or more of the 12 potential collection gaps identified previously would be considered. NMS examples include data procurement options that augment one or more capability areas, or the use of non-traditional weather data sources.<br />3. This request is for industry market research, budgetary and planning estimation purposes only. The Government will not award a contract on the basis of this market surveyor responses received.

<CONTACT>Tara McAdoo, (706)791-1831

<a href="mailto:tara.mcadoo@us.army.mil">MICC - Fort Gordon</a>
<DESC>Posted Date: 16 NOV 2012 <br> Response Date: 14 DEC 2012 <br>  <br> 1.	Introduction. The Fort Gordon Signal Center of Excellence (SIGCoE) Capabilities Development Integration Directorate, Experimentation Division, (CDID-ED) is seeking commercial vendors and DOD organizations that would like to showcase their emerging communications and networking technologies at the U.S. Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiment (AEWE) Spiral I that will be conducted at the U.S. Army's Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE), Ft. Benning, GA, 2nd Qtr FY 2014.  <br>    <br> 2.	Background.  AEWE provides U.S. Army Capability Developers, the Science and Technology (S&T) community, and Industry with a repeatable, credible, rigorous, and validated operational venue to support Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities (DOTMLPF) concepts and materiel development efforts in a realistic, live, prototype, force-on-force experiment.  AEWE also presents industry with an opportunity to gain Soldier and Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) feedback on new product developments prior to demonstrating them at events such as the Network Integration Exercise (NIE) at Fort Bliss, TX. The experiment culminates with a VIP Day where technologies are given visibility at the Army Acquisition Community level.  AEWE is focused at the Small Unit level (Company and below) and examines concepts and capabilities for the current and future force across all Warfighting functions.  AEWE is sponsored by the Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) and executed by the MCoE in cooperation with the Signal Center of Excellence (SIGCoE) and other Army TRADOC (Training and Doctrine Command) Centers of Excellence.    <br>  <br> 3.	Network Capabilities Sought:   <br> a.	The SIGCoE will work with selected vendors and government organizations to design a reliable communications (transport) network for AEWE Spiral I that can adequately support the integration and evaluation of diverse intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) technologies, while providing voice and data services for the AEWE Experimentation Force (EXFOR) and Opposing Force (OPFOR). See Attachment 1 for sample EXFOR layout. The network must provide voice, mission command (mounted and dismounted) and video services (streaming and still picture) in support of an Infantry Company performing tactical operations (Cordon/Search, Defense, Attack, Ambush, Route Recon, Area Recon).  <br> b.	While stable network performance is required, the ideal AEWE Spiral I transport network would have a hybrid design that integrates/augments software defined tactical radios that are part of the Army's Communications Capability Set (CS) 13/14 with emerging network/communications technologies and concepts that can be evaluated against documented capability gaps, operational need statements (ONS), and Joint Urgent Operational Need Statements (JUONS).   The Spiral I network should also provide the Army a network concept that can be explored for future Capability Sets, CS 15/16 and beyond. <br> c.	At a minimum, the AEWE communications network must provide the following services for the EXFOR and OPFOR:       <br> i.	Dismounted, Man-portable Voice/Data Communication Systems; <br> ii.	Mounted Voice/Data Communication Systems; <br> iii.	Communications Range Extension Capabilities; <br> iv.	Mission Command Systems (mounted and dismounted); <br> v.	Video Compression and Distribution technologies. <br> d.	Respondents are encouraged to create partnerships with other vendors or Government organizations to bring together a partial or full set of communications capabilities required for the AEWE Spiral I communications network.    <br>  <br> 4.	AEWE network technologies of interest: Below is a list of capabilities that the Army SIGCoE is interested in seeing demonstrated as part of the AEWE transport network: <br>   <br> a.	Any technologies that can improve current Army communication system's Size, Weight, Power and Cost (SWAP-C) characteristics; <br>  <br> b.	Adaptive/phased array antenna technologies capable of interfacing with existing tactical radios; <br>  <br> c.	Cognitive radio technologies;  <br>  <br> d.	Aerial mounted communications platforms (UAV, aerostat, etc.); <br>  <br> e.	Technologies that optimize tactical (BN & below) network performance;  <br>  <br> f.	Augmentation of CS 13/14 assets with technologies that will improve the transmission of ISR data to the tactical edge; <br>  <br> g.	Technologies that improve network security of tactical-edge information system devices and the associated network; <br>  <br> h.	Systems that bridge dissimilar tactical networking waveforms (SRW, ANW2, WNW); <br>  <br> i.	Hybrid systems that integrate multiple communications capabilities (Radio, COMSEC, data services, user interface, etc) in one form-factor to improve SWAP-C characteristics and/or network performance;  <br>  <br> j.	Peripheral devices that improve Soldier-to-Device interfaces, to reduce cognitive and dexterous load, allowing the Soldier to maintain tactical situational awareness, while simultaneously being able to efficiently/effectively interface with their respective communications/ information system.  <br>  <br> k.	Technologies that can be integrated with existing dismounted mission command systems to allow soldier tracking (Position Location Information) in GPS restrictive environments. <br>  <br> l.	Optimized NetOps tool that can be used by Signal Soldiers assigned at the BCT level and below to track network health, provide real-time RF signal coverage maps, record and analyze network statistics, monitor all network connected devices and associated SNMP MIBs, create reports, and provide remote device configuration capabilities. <br>  <br> 5.	Sequence of Events:   Vendors that are interested in being considered for participation in AEWE Spiral I must submit a white paper and quad chart as described in paragraphs 6 and 7.  The AEWE Spiral I selection process will adhere to the timeline shown below.    <br>  <br> a.	14 Dec 2012 - White paper/quad chart submissions due; <br>  <br> b.	21 Dec 2012 - Vendors invited to present technology at AEWE Spiral I Technology Selection Conference; <br>  <br> c.	9-10 JAN 2013 - AEWE Spiral I Technology Selection Conference, TRADOC Headquarters, Fort Eustis, VA;  <br>  <br> d.	25 Jan 2013 - AEWE Spiral I Technology Selections announced;  <br>  <br> e.	20 - 22 Mar 2013 - AEWE Spiral I Initial Planning Conference; Fort Benning, GA.  <br>  <br> 6.	White Paper and Quad Chart Submissions:   <br>  <br> a.	The following organizations may submit white papers and quad charts on the technologies that they want considered for participation in AEWE Spiral I:  DOD laboratories, colleges and universities, non-profit research institutions, commercial firms, large and small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and minority business enterprises and institutions.

 Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) VISN 22, on behalf of the VA San Diego Healthcare System intends to make a sole-source award to Dr. Dieter Hillert, PhD located at 1719 Deerfield Rd. Encinitas, CA 92024. 

Dr. Hillert shall perform work as it relates to a Linguist Research Consultant, a commercially available service as described in FAR Part 12 "Acquisition of Commercial Items". The period of performance for this service shall not exceed one (1) year from the time of award. Dr. Hillert has performed this work in connection with the VA's Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) research & development project's inception. Dr. Hillert has an expertise in a cutting edge field of computer science research concerned with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and linguistics called Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages -- that is, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or natural language input. Dr. Hillert has developed most if not all of the corpora associated with this VINCI project. A corpus (plural, "corpora") is a core set of documents (or sometimes, individual sentences or natural language expressions) that have been hand-annotated with the correct values that can be "learned" and even used to make "decisions" based on statistical inferences via complex algorithms by a computer. 

VINCI is an initiative to improve researchers' access to VA data and to facilitate the analysis of those data while ensuring Veterans' privacy and data security. VINCI staff are partnering with research groups such as the Consortium for Health Informatics Research (CHIR) to bring new types of data and new applications to VINCI. The focus is on structured data derived from text using Natural Language Processing. Funded by HSR&D and OI&T, VINCI functions in conjunction with the Office of Informatics and Analytics (VHA OIA).

Based on the nature of the project and the complexity of the work already performed by Dr. Hillert, it has been determined that no other source can  meet Governments expressed requirement, as the project's result set could be impacted or skewed by a change in the linguistic interpretation of another Linguist at this stage. The harm to Government would be an unquantifiable loss of research effort; funding; and the benefit of this very important work to our Veterans. None of which is reasonably expected to be recovered through competition.

The authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition is cited at FAR 6.302-3 "Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert Services". This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation will be available. Firms that believe that it can provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 10 days from the publication date of this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for notification purposes.

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS MODIFICATION WILL BE PROCURED ON A NON-COMPETITIVE BASIS UNDER AN EXISTING INDEFINITE DELIVERY/INDEFINITE QUANTITY CONTRACT FOR PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING SERVICES FOR THE NIST CENTER FOR NEUTRON RESEARCH (NCNR).
<p>This notice is issued in accordance with the guidance for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.</p>
<p>Contract Number SB1341-07-CQ-0016, Task Order Number 10478 was <br />awarded to Merrick and Company of Aurora, CO on September 23, 2010, in the amount of $4,663,448.08. The period of performance <br />was September 27, 2010, through April 15, 2012.</p>
<p>Description of Services<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)/NCNR<br />reactor is equipped with a thermal shield. This radiation shield consists of steel and lead that has to be water cooled in order to be kept at a temperature where it does not change shape under its own weight. Over the many years of usage the thermal shield plumbing has developed tiny leaks, which are impossible to repair.</p>
<p>Work under this task order required the fabrication of, <br />installation of and training for the upgrade of the thermal shield plumbing system whereby the cooling water is administered by moving it through the shield using a vacuum rather than a positive pump pressure as in the present mechanical configuration.</p>
<p>The task order was awarded on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 16.505(b)(2)(iii).</p>
<p>Modification 0007 will be executed to extend the warranty period by thirteen days, through November 30, 2012.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with California Institute of Technology, Pasadena CA under other than full and open competition.
<p>NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.<br />(2) Only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Sole Source determination is based on the following: The proposed contractor's personnel has unique experience with the NIST scattering test facility, having worked with NIST staff to design it, build it, and make initial measurements with it. The contractor has specialized expertise with sub-mm-wave sources, detectors, and experimental techniques in this frequency range, making them uniquely suited to perform the research services. As a result, California Institute of Technology is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Boulder, CO, and be completed by February 2013</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 611300, and the size standard is $7M.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by the response date above. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to leonard.spakow@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFOMRATION PURPOSES ONLY.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract to Orion Dredging Services, LLC.  This sole source contract is required for maintenance dredging portions of the Lower and Middle James River Federal Navigation Project with completion of period of performance on 14 February 2013.   <br>  <br> The existing single award task order contract (SATOC) used to perform maintenance dredging on the James River was awarded to Orion Dredging Company using full and unrestricted competition on 28 June 2010 for a maximum amount of $9,000,000.00.  The SATOC consisted of a base year with two optional years.  The base year and both optional years have been awarded and are represented by three task orders (TO), one task order per year, respectively.  Contract capacity was reached during execution of TO number 3 due to an unexpected amount of additional shoaling that resulted from recent storm events and exacerbated by Hurricane Sandy.  This effort is a contained in the scope of TO#0003, but the base IDIQ ceiling has been reached.  <br>  <br> The dredging contract will include the removal of approximately 500,000 cubic yards of dredge material from the James River Federal Navigation Project with overboard placement of the material occurring adjacent to the project's dredging locations.  Dredging will be required to an elevation of -26 feet Mean Lower Low Water, with one foot of additional dredging depth allowed.  The estimated dollar value for the proposed action is $2,000,000 which reflects the total cost to dredge in the following channels.  The work will be performed in Tribell Shoal Channel, Dancing Point-Swan Point Channel, and Jordan Point-Harrison Bar-Windmill Point Shoal Channel.   <br>  <br> THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability of other qualified sources that can meet the above extensive requirements specified above.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.   <br>  <br> Submit any inquiries no later than 30 NOVEMBER 2012 via email: veronica.a.mcguire@usace.army.mil (List W91236-13-R-0003 in the subject line of the email) or mail to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: Veronica McGuire 803 Front Street, Norfolk, VA 23510.   <br>

VA will continue to focus on the gaps for underserved populations and on expanding access so that every Veteran can get the care needed, at the right place and the right time. The Initiative also includes outreach efforts to proactively identify and communicate with Veterans who may be eligible for services, but are unaware of the benefits or the enrollment process.

For those supplies or services requiring qualification, whether the covered product or service is an end item under this contract or simply a component of an end item, the product, manufacturer, or source must have demonstrated that it meets the standards prescribed for qualification before award of this contract. The product, manufacturer, or source must be qualified at the time<br />of award whether or not the name of the product, manufacturer, or source is actually included on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list. Offerors should contact the agency activity designated below to obtain all requirements that they or their products or services, or their subcontractors or their products or services, must satisfy<br />to become qualified and to arrange for an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for<br />qualification.<br />(Name) _<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stephen Sterle</span>_______<br />(Address) _<span style="text-decoration: underline;">USDA-ARS-NADC, 1920 Dayton Ave., Building 24, Ames, IA 50010</span>__<br />(c) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service covered by a qualification requirement has already met the standards specified, the relevant information noted below should be provided.<br />Offeror's Name _____________________________________<br />Manufacturer's Name______ __________________________<br />Source's Name _____________________________________<br />Item Name ________________________________________<br />Service Identification ________________________________<br />Test Number _______________________________________<br />(to the extent known)<br />(d) Even though a product or service subject to a qualification requirement is not itself an end item under this contract,<br />the product, manufacturer, or source must nevertheless be qualified at the time of award of this contract. This is necessary<br />whether the Contractor or a subcontractor will ultimately provide the product or service in question. If, after award, the Contracting Officer discovers that an applicable qualification requirement was not in fact met at the time of award, the Contracting Officer may either terminate this contract for default or allow performance to continue if adequate consideration is offered and the action is determined to be otherwise in the Government's best interests.<br />(e) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service has met the qualification requirement but is not yet on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, the offeror must submit evidence of qualification prior to award of this contract.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br /><br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the evaluation team. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide commericial subscribers lines, local access digital trunks, transport channels, circuit extensions, public listings, directory number and number portability, operator and directory assistance, local and Intra-LATA access, and interconnection with Inter-LATA exchange carrier. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>Subfactor 4 - Diversity. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound pictorial approach for diversity to include the methodology for accomplishing diversity.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. No Offeror shall alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered an unacceptable offer and may result in the offer being considered non responsive. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. In addition, to identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced, enter "NSP" in the unit price and/or to identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge, enter "NC" in the unit price.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the evaluation team. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />1a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide commericial subscribers lines, local access digital trunks, transport channels, circuit extensions, public listings, directory number and number portability, operator and directory assistance, local and Intra-LATA access, and interconnection with Inter-LATA exchange carrier. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>Subfactor 4 - Diversity. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound pictorial approach for diversity to include the methodology for accomplishing diversity.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>b. Task performance<br />These syntheses must be carried out by the company contracted (i.e., the company contracted should not acquire them from another source and simply resell them to the government) to ensure that they are of known quality and integrity.</p>
<p>c. Variations in position and number of 13C stable isotope labels<br />The position and number of 13C atoms has been proposed and is the preferred for each requested compound. However, contractors are welcome to propose an alternative stable isotope labeling scheme for each compound provided that the proposed compound would still be fit for use as an internal standard in LC-MS/MS analyses. In the case of alternative proposals, the following will apply:<br />&bull; a concise narrative clearly explaining why an alternative to the position and/or number of 13C stable isotope labels is proposed must be provided;<br />&bull; each compound must have a minimum of three (3), covalent, non-labile 13C labels; labeling with stable isotopes other than 13C (e.g., 2H) will not be accepted; and<br />&bull; all other stated requirements, including (but not limited to) minimum quantities, confirmation of chemical structure, isotopic and chemical purity, documentation and delivery schedule must still be satisfied by the alternative proposal.</p>
<p>d. Other pertinent information<br />We have received reports from a contractor previously tasked with synthesizing these compounds that the use of 3,3-dimethyldioxirane (DMDO) (e.g. Horie T. et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 45, 446, 1997) and 2,3-Dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) (e.g. Rao Y.K. et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem., 13, 6850, 2005) in introducing the ring hydroxyl group of the flavanol was unsuccessful. We cannot say with absolute certainty that the use of these oxidation compounds by others will yield the same unsuccessful result. However, we disclose this information as a cautionary note to all potential proposals and strongly suggest that interested parties carefully consider this information and possibly test these procedures before committing their use to a proposal.</p>

<DESC>Justification. Request a hotel/conference center be selected in Atlantic City and NJ that provides a single location for Families and Soldiers to attend the DOD mandated 30 Day Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program Event. Other scheduled events include a Freedom Salute/Awards Dinner, and Mental Health/PTSD/TBI counseling. The selected date provides adequate time for soldiers to return from leave (annual and PDMRA) and be released from Title 10 status. The Atlantic City location provides adequate facilities for Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program events and meets leadership's intent for the type and quality of locations required to conduct YRRP events among redeploying units. Atlantic City hotels must be within the city limits due to command safety concerns.

<p><br />II. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>MORTUARY SERVICES <br />1.0 General Information: <br />1.0.1 Contractor must provide and maintain all management, supervision, manpower, equipment, supplies, licenses, permits, insurance, transportation and any other resources necessary to accomplish the services described and required within the statement of work (SOW).<br />1.0.2 Contractors must be licensed, bonded, and an insured mortuary provider.<br />1.0.3 The projected period of performance will be in effect for a base period and four (4) one (1) year option periods. Services shall commence on December 17, 2012 through December 16, 2013. The total period of the contract shall not exceed five (5) years.<br />1.1 Anatomical Gift Program<br />The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) is a medical teaching university that utilizes human cadavers and freshly donated human remains into its academic curriculum. The Anatomical Gift Program permits the acceptance of whole bodies, non-autopsied, non-organ donated for the purposes of the program. The USUHS Anatomical Gift Program allows the military and civilians the opportunity to donate their whole body or that of a family member to USUHS for teaching and medical research purposes. USUHS allows the donation via the donor themselves, or authorized Next Of Kin, over 18 years of age. USUHS also accepts anatomical donations no more than 48 hours after death and embalmed human remains on a case by case basis. <br />USUHS obligates expenses for the transportation of remains from place of death; Contractor shall file and provide minimal of two (2) death certificates to the Next Of Kin; preparation of remains via (B4) brachial arterial flush or (embalming) chemical preparation; delivery to USUHS, cremation, and delivery of cremated to USUHS. If the Next Of Kin seeks additional death certificates, the family shall reimburse the Contractor directly. <br />Contractors will be required to transport human remains from various places of death, such as residences, hospitals, state agencies (Anatomy Board), hospice care facilities, nursing homes, medical examiners offices, and other funeral providers. The Anatomical Gift Program only accepts donations within a radius of 100 of miles from the place of death to USUHS. Donations greater than 100 miles radius, will require the next of kin to incur all associated expenses. These expenses are not limited to additional mileage for transport exceeding 100 miles, any out of state permit, or filing/obtaining death certificate fee. <br />Annually, the Contractor shall expect to transport from the Maryland State Anatomy Board: 75 cadavers; 20 donated fresh bodies; various cadaver specimens; 60 human brain specimens, in sealed and leak and spill proof containers. <br />1.2. Death Call Services<br />The USUHS Anatomical Gift Program receives calls during and after business hours regarding death notification of a registered donor, or general inquiries regarding application for the USUHS anatomical donation program. The Contractor shall answer calls daily from 4:00 p.m. through 8:00 a.m. when USUHS transfers the donation phone line, after hours (4:00 p.m.) and throughout the weekend. USUHS donation phone line will transfer to the contractor's mainline to support the Anatomical Gift Program support and inquiries. <br />It is important for the contractor to identify the types of USUHS donation calls. The Contractor must determine the following; <br />Is the caller: <br />(1) Notifying USUHS of the death of a preregistered donor? If not, the Contractor will instruct the Next of Kin (NOK) that they will have to contact the Anatomical Director during the next business day to establish eligibility. <br />(2) If the caller is reporting the death of a registered donor, the Contractor will obtain only basic information: the deceased's name, the address where the deceased is located, NOK name and NOK phone number. After confirming the donor is registered (most families will inform you), the contractor shall arrange transportation to the funeral home. The Contractor shall hold, prepare and deliver the remains to USUHS within 48 hours. It is paramount that the funeral provider only transfer remains after hours if refrigeration/morgue is not available (such as residences, and Hospice Units). All hospital death calls will be transferred to the funeral home only when the death certificate has been secured, and remains have been released. <br />(3) If the caller seeks donation information, please forward the caller's contact information and any messages to the Anatomical Curator the next official business day. <br />The contractor will obtain specific information identifying if the caller represents an existing registered donor, or if the caller seeks information regarding donation. This criterion is important to ensure that the Contractor does not accept a body that would be unqualified per USUHS anatomical donation standards. <br />**If Contractor accepts a body that is not registered, without consulting Anatomical Director, the Contractor is 100% liable for the care and disposition of remains. **<br />1.3 Performance of Services:<br />The Contractor will transfer anatomical donations to a licensed funeral home and store in refrigeration or embalm upon request of the Anatomical Curator. Once the Contractor has confirmed the donor is registered with USUHS, the Contractor will contact USUHS the next business day and request a facsimile of the vital statistics for the death certificate. <br />The follow services are expected within scope of contractual agreement.<br />The Contractor shall: <br />a. Secure a signed death certificate and burial transit permit.<br />b. If the death certificate is not signed within 24 hours of death, the physician shall be contacted to arrange signature.<br />c. Obtain only basic information from the caller. <br />(If the donor is registered, there is no need to request vital statistics. The vital statistics are on file). <br />d. All remains must be properly tagged identifying: last name, first name, date of death, and location of death. The tag shall be affixed to the left ankle or right ankle if left is amputated. The affixed tag shall be written as:</p>
<p>SMITH, JOHN,C. DOD: 12DEC12 <br />Place of death (Residence/Hospital/Morgue, etc.)</p>
<p>e. Under no circumstances shall a removal take place from a hospital or institution that has adequate refrigeration (religious pref. may be considered).<br />f. Residential removals require two or more personnel at all times. There are no exceptions.<br />g. Nursing homes and hospice units that do not have refrigeration will be given a three (3) hour lead time to make the transfer. <br />h. If the registered donor is located greater than 100 miles from USUHS or requires a Delaware, Pennsylvania, or West Virginia storage and/or permit, the next of kin is responsible for the expenses to secure the remains, out of state death certificates and any and all associated expenses to transfer to the USUHS.<br />i. Store remains into their care via refrigeration and/or embalming. <br />j. Order large sterile needles for blood drawing from the donor patient.<br />k. Fill two (2) vials (provided from USUHS) with blood and store with refrigerated remains until delivery to USUHS. The vials must have the donor name, initials of whom drew the blood and the date drawn. The two vials will be placed in a sealed plastic bag and taped to the chest of the donor prior to delivery to the USUHS. <br />l. Shave the heads of all donor patients. <br />m. Perform a full body flush of fluids by injecting a B4 chemical (Hydrol Chemical) into the donor brachial artery and drain fluids via femoral vein. The Contractor shall close all arteries and veins with suture and glue to prevent further leakage. <br />n. Place human remains in heavy and leak proof body bags as provided by the USUHS. Under no circumstances will body bags be used twice. <br />o. Contact the USUHS to arrange delivery of donor's remains. <br />p. Upon delivery, the Contractor shall remove human remains and deliver to the morgue receiving area, USUHS, Bldg. A. Room G3034. The USUHS ATL staff will assist moving the human remains from the contractor stretcher and transfer to the USUHS refrigeration.<br />q. The USUHS ATL personnel will sign the Contractor's Chain of Custody forms and visually identify the leg tag or hospital ID band upon arrival. <br />r. The USUHS ATL staff will sign for any personal effects as delivered by the Contractor.</p>
<p>1.4 Remains</p>
<p>Unless specified or arranged in advance, all Anatomical Gift Donations will be cremated. Once the designated medical research and/or anatomical usage are concluded, the cadaveric remains will be transported directly to a registered and licensed crematory as directed by the Contractor. Once cremated remains are ready the Anatomical Curator will provide individual cremation authorizations and burial transit permits. The Contractor shall return arranged cremation and return cremated remains to USUHS for final disposition. Cremated remains must be incased in a temporary polyethylene urn. If the Contractor utilizes a crematory facility that also cremates pets, the contractor must ensure the facility cremates humans separately. The Contractor takes full liability for this process. <br />All preserved cadavers from the Maryland State Anatomy Board will be transported to a crematory as designated by the Maryland State Anatomy Board. <br />When returning cremated remains to USUHS, the Contractor shall ensure:<br />a. All remains are accompanied with the appropriate documentation: death certificate, burial-transit permit, and other approvals as required (i.e., medical examiner's stamp).<br />b. The Contractor shall provide cremation mailer boxes and tote bags suitable for local delivery to the next of kin. <br />c. Upon receipt of cremated remains the contractor will deliver to the morgue receiving area, USUHS, Bldg. A. Room G038. <br />d. The Anatomical Curator or an authorized USUHS ATL staff will sign the Contractor's Chain of Custody forms for acceptance of the ashes.</p>
<p>1.4.1 Transportation of Remains: The Contractor is required to perform the following transportation services: <br />(a) The Contractor shall coordinate the removal of remains as soon as possible when notified of a death. <br />(b) The Contractor shall take possession of the remains at the place where they are located and transport them to the USUHS.</p>
<p>1.4.2 Performance and Delivery: <br />(a) The Contractor shall furnish the material ordered and perform the services specified as promptly as possible after receiving notification to remove the remains.<br />(b) The USUHS may require the Contractor to hold the remains in refrigeration for an additional period not to exceed 48 hours from the time the remains are removed from the place of death.<br />(c) Contractor must be aware that movement of human remains is a delicate process, and can consist of movement of remains up to 300lbs. Contractors must be aware and prepared with proper back brace support and manpower to ensure safety of hired staff, and not to drop remains at any time.</p>
<p>1.5 Permits<br />The Contractor must meet all state and local licensing requirements and obtain and furnish all necessary Health Department and shipping permits at no additional cost to the Government. The Contractor will ensure that all necessary Health Department permits are in order for disposition of the remains, provide a non-certified copy of the death certificate, and the original burial transit permit. In addition, the Contractor will secure an executed Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences Anatomical Gift Program "Certificate of Body Donation by Next of Kin" when requested by the USUHS. The Contractor will maintain a supply of USUHS Body Donation forms for this purpose.</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><strong><br />Proposal Submission Place:<br /></strong>Gboyega Akintobi<br />Oando Gas &amp; Power Limited<br />Tender Committee <br />9th Floor<br />No. 2 Ajose Adeogun Street<br />Victoria Island, Lagos<br />Phone No: +234 (1) 270 2400 Ext. 6446</p>
<p>Oando Gas &amp; Power Limited (the "Grantee") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to evaluate the technical feasibility and economic viability of deploying compressed natural gas (CNG) refueling stations around Lagos State (the "Project") in Nigeria. The feasibility study will consider the requirements and the viability of utilizing existing fuel retail outlets and constructing new CNG stations to strategically provide adequate spread and access across the state. The study will assess the requirements and develop plans for CNG infrastructure (i.e. gas supply sources, mother stations, transportation) and refueling stations (i.e. locations, gas supply, construction issues); identify and analyze policy and regulatory issues; perform an assessment of the demand for CNG from industry, electric power producers, vehicle, and other markets; and assess the economic and financial viability of the Project.</p>
<p>The Project will develop the CNG infrastructure off of Nigeria's growing pipeline network. It is anticipated that the first phase of the Project will rollout approximately ten to fifteen CNG daughter stations within the Lagos metropolitan region, which will be supplied with CNG by the mother station which is currently under construction by the Grantee. The second phase of the Project will likely implement an additional mother station with its own respective daughter stations in order to provide an adequate spread of refueling locations and access to CNG across Lagos State. In addition to the mother-daughter stations, it is estimated that at least ten CNG retrofit and CNG vehicle maintenance and repair facilities will need to be established throughout the state. The establishment of this CNG infrastructure will facilitate the development of multiple industries, likely including small scale captive electric power generation and industrial processing using CNG as feedstock or fuel.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $494,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5:00 PM, Local (LAGOS) Time, January 11, 2013</span></strong> at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p><br />SHIP &amp; BASE ACCESS <br />Vendors are responsible for correctly submitting forms/applications. Vendors are encouraged to monitor email using "Request a Read Receipt" function and to confirm receipt of facsimile transmissions.</p>
<p>Due to enhanced security measures, ship and base access is required for pre-award ship visits (e.g. ship-check) and for contract performance. Specifically the following permissions are required:</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<DESC>The attached pricing sheet shall be filled out by those submitting quotes. Only those cells highlighted in yellow should be filled out. Any changes to the cells' existing formulas or numbers by the contractor shall be highlighted in red and explained in detail in their pricing narrative. The second tab shows an example of how the contractor shall approach the spreadsheet should they have two or more applicable GSA rates for each contractual year requested. It is up to the contractor to ensure that annual estimates as well as a total estimated cost are clearly defined. Plug numbers are given for ODCs, travel, and materials. Any changes to those by the contractor shall be explained clearly in their pricing narrative. The third tab is for labor hour rates for contractor facilities. Nearly all work is anticipated to take place at Government facilities; however, should there be cases where support is required at the contractor's facilities, the rates will already be contractual. The quote evaluated will be that in the first tab with Government facility rates. Many of the labor categories show zero hours anticipated; however, it is important that the contract show rates for all categories should the need arise for their use. Although the&nbsp;quotes evaluated will be based upon Labor Hour rates, it is anticipated that many of the task orders will be requested to be proposed as firm-fixed-price. Questions regarding this spreadsheet shall be sent to Brad Grimm at <a href="mailto:william.grimm@hq.dhs.gov">william.grimm@hq.dhs.gov</a>. The spreadsheet will be discussed in detail at Industry Day on November 30, 2012.<br /><br />Please continue to monitor this FBO posting as any updates will be posted here.

<DESC>The United States Army Expeditionary Contracting Command - 410th Contracting Support Brigade (CSB) is planning to solicit and award a firm fixed-price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC).  The MATOC will be for Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR) and Disaster Preparedness (DP) Assessment, Logistics, and Training (ALT) Support Services and Supplies, heretofore referred to as HA/DP ALT, in the United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR) which includes, but is not limited to, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean, and the United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) AOR, specifically Mexico and the Bahamas, for a 12-month base period and two 12-month options. The MATOC will be structured for maximum flexibility in providing for an expedited ordering process in order to satisfy the needs of USSOUTHCOM?USNORTHCOM in the execution of its mission in their missions in their respective AORs. HA/DP ALT contractors will provide support in the following three task areas:  <br>  <br> Task 1 - Assessment: Support the observation, examination, inspection, and analysis of the humanitarian assistance and disaster preparedness of various organizations, their plans, operations, and logistics. Appraise, evaluate and measure various organizations, their plans, operations, and logistics.  The surveillance and assessment will take an overarching approach at all levels and at all agencies, governmental, non-governmental and civil;  <br>  <br> Task 2 - Logistics:  Support TO requirements with the provision of certain logistic items including but not limited to the following types of support - supply operations, field services, and other operations/services; and  <br>  <br> Task 3 - Training:  Support USSOUTHCOM/USNORTHCOM training responsibilities inherent to the HA/DP mission and operations requirements, and compliance with and performance of statutory, regulatory, and doctrine governing and pertaining to the HA/DP mission and operations. This includes all collective training; training readiness; training to established requirements and levels; the process, conduct of training operations and assurance of training to standards to meet HA/DP Operations; the development and execution of plans, programs and efficacy of HA/DP training; and the provisioning and supervision of training and training support to accommodate prescribed HA/DP objectives.  Training support may include risk/safety assessments as needed.  Training may include providing and installing equipment and providing logistics support at host nation training events.  Performance of work will be at various echelons, organizations using various formats including classroom, on-site, on-the-job, and distance learning.    <br>  <br> The applicable NAICS code is 541614, Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting Services; with a small business size standard of $14.0 million. This requirement will be solicited on a total small business set-aside basis. <br>  <br> The nations of Central and South America and the Caribbean as well as Mexico and The Bahamas have continually experienced a turbulent history of widespread natural disasters. Throughout the region, J4 USSOUTHCOM and USNORTHCOM IC (Interagency Coordination), in collaboration with local, national, regional, international, governmental and non-governmental organizations, is working to improve recipient nations' disaster response capabilities. This has been accomplished by increasing the capacity and regional infrastructure of recipient nations through support of established regional emergency management mechanisms. A coordinated effort between the U.S. Country Teams and USSOUTHCOM/USNORTHCOM has improved the capacity of recipient nations to respond to humanitarian emergencies and reduce the need for U.S. military assistance. The J4 and IC are responsible for tailoring community development actions in developing countries with a strong emphasis on regions and villages particularly susceptible to natural or man-made disasters.  <br>  <br> HA/DP activities meet two key requirements: maintaining a robust overseas presence aimed at shaping the international security environment in a manner that deters would-be aggressors, strengthens friends and allies, and promoting peace and stability in regions of tension; and, when called upon, assist the victims of natural or manmade disasters. This segment of the program is also tailored to help partner nations, particularly those that have been affected by disaster or hardship, to improve healthcare, education and ensure sustainable community development. The ultimate goal is to build the capacity of community members in order to meet existing and future challenges and mitigate the need for U.S. assistance.  <br>  <br> This solicitation will be issued on or about December 7, 2012 and available to be downloaded from the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/. All potential offerors should monitor the ASFI website as well as the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at https://www.fbo.gov/ for further developments. Upon issuance of the solicitation, all responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the Contracting Officer. <br>  <br> Questions concerning this requirement may be directed to the Contract Specialist via email at mark.r.chase.civ@mail.mil. Secondary point of contact is the Contracting Officer at mary.s.austin2.civ@mail.mil. No phone calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) intends to issue a modification to the firm fixed price purchase order number 200-2012-M-53217 awarded pursuant to this announcement. The J.H. Fletcher D-15 HDDR roof bolting machine is used by NIOSH for research on noise reduction and other mining concerns. It had been modified by the manufacturer with control systems that enable highly consistent drilling parameters and monitoring. This feedback control system is unique to J.H. Fletcher and is required to perform consistent testing for continued noise control research.
<p>After starting the work to refurbish the NIOSH-owned Fletcher D-15 roof bolting machine, a number of major unforeseen problems were discovered and it was determined that it is not feasible to refurbish the current NIOSH-owned D-15 roof bolting machine. In lieu of the refurbishing effort, the contractor will provide a newer rebuilt D-15 model that can be configured with the same feedback control system. <br /><br />The refurbished model D-15 roof bolting machine available from J.H. Fletcher can replace NIOSH's malfunctioning HDDR model roof bolting machine while preserving performance and functionality of the roof bolting system. The system must function consistently in order to compare the results of&nbsp;future studies using the roof bolting machine with past studies conducted with it in the NIOSH laboratories.<br /><br />The fixed price to NIOSH for the refurbished unit will be $49,503, the same amount as awarded on purchase order 200-2012-M-53217. <br /><br />This procurement is for a refurbished D-15 roof bolting machine for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This modification will be made using Simplified Acquisition Procedures found in FAR Part 13.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within fifteen (15) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. <br />All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov prior to an award of a federal contract. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to Florence Black at fpblack@cdc.gov by 3:00 PM December 1, 2012.</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT 2 TO ANNOUNCEMENT (Posted on 11-16-2012) The FAA received additional questions about this planned Industry Day.  Here are thequestions along with the FAA's response:  
QUESTION:  Will there be PowerPoint slides of the presentations made available after the event?  
FAA RESPONSE:  Slides will be available in the meeting via web link.  Final slides will be available one week after the event via e-mail to all that signed up to attend (including those that were wait-listed but who were not ultimately included on the attendance list).  
QUESTION:  Are there additional exhibit booths available ?
FAA RESPONSE:  Unfortunately, all available exhibit booths have been scheduled and it will not be possible to schedule additional booths due to capacity limitations at the hotel.  
QUESTION:  Is there a good chance that those on the wait list will be allowed to attend the Industry Day Event?  
FAA RESPONSE:  Unfortunately, due to capacity limitations, it is unlikely that many of those on the wait list will be allowed to attend.  

AMENDMENT 1 TO ANNOUNCEMENT (Posted on 11-9-2012) The FAA received two questions about this planned Industry Day.  Here are the questions along with FAA's responses:  
QUESTION:  Is it necessary to register for Industry Day?  
FAA RESPONSE:  Yes attendees are required to register ahead of time.  Register on-line via this web site (as shown in the initial announcement):  
	www.faaindustryforum2012.eventbrite.com
Due to the needs of planning and logistics for the event, we will stop the registration on Monday, November 26, 2012 at 4:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time.  In fact, registration may "max out" before that date since we have space for a finite number of attendees.  We plan to allow only those folks that register to attend the forum.  We have space for approximately 480 attendees.  As of November 8, 2012, there were approximately 350 individuals registered.  
QUESTION:  Will the Industry Day scheduled for Nov 28/29/30 represent the TFDM Industry Day that has been discussed previously? Or is this a separate event from the planned TFDM Industry Day? Is there going to be a separate Industry Day that addresses only TFDM issues? 
FAA RESPONSE:  The previously discussed TFDM Industry Day is fully integrated into this event.  Given the close relationships between many of these programs/systems, the FAA has decided to host one comprehensive event in the place of several independent program Industry Days.  

ORIGINALLY POSTED ANNOUNCEMENT (Posted on 11-7-2012):  
"The Sky Is the Limit!" -- FAA Industry Forum 2012 Sponsored by the FAA ATO Program Management Organization
When: November 28 & 29 (9 am - 5 pm) and November 30 (9 am - noon)

<DESC>This project is 100% Set Aside for Small Business.  PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Construction services include strengthening a 3,380-foot section of the Bradley Canyon Levee, Santa Barbara County, CA. The levee will be strengthened by two methods: installing a steel combi-wall and constructing a soil cement revetment. The new combi-wall will connect to an existing combi-wall and will be installed at the crest of the Bradley Canyon levee along a 1,000-foot section. The combi-wall consists of king piles and sheet piles. The king piles and sheet piles will be driven to depths of approximately 64 feet and 52 feet, respectively. The upstream end of the combi-wall will overlap with the downstream end of the soil cement revetment. The soil cement revetment will be constructed against the existing levee at a slope of 2 horizontal: 1 vertical and have a width of 8 feet. The soil cement will extend approximately 2,380 feet and will have a vertical height of approximately 30 feet. Approximately 19 feet of the soil cement height will be buried. A section of the Bradley Canyon levee will be raised with compacted fill by a maximum 1.6 feet. The existing low flow will be diverted during construction and restored after construction is completed.  The estimated cost of this project is $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes and is published only to encourage interested parties to gather information about commercially available products that meet or can be readily modified to meet the requirements discussed below.
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS; IT IS STRICTLY A RFI. NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI. NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p>1. SUBJECT: The United States Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA) is conducting market research on technology solutions for Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) suitable for field use in a battlefield setting. Responses are due to this Request for Information (RFI) by 31 Jan 2013, 4:00 PM EDT.</p>
<p>2. DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Information and representative samples as responses to the RFI will not be returned. At this time, USAMMA will not entertain any questions concerning the composition, requirements, or the nature of services to be performed under any future Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>3. BACKGROUND: Wounds sustained on the battlefield can be especially problematic, given the nature and severity of the injuries and the environment in which they are sustained. In the deployed environment, one modality that is being considered to improve wound healing is Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT). With NPWT, subatmospheric pressure is applied to a wound via a suction unit, dressing, evacuation tube, and outer dressing. The system is connected to a collection container that collects excess fluid from the wound bed, thereby enhancing circulation and disposal of cellular waste from the lymphatic system. Clinical benefits associated with the treatment reportedly include increasing local blood flow, decreasing bacterial colonization, facilitating the ability to measure and assess wound fluid, and increasing the rate of granulation tissue creation, contraction, and epithelialization. In addition, the wound is uniformly drawn closed by applying controlled, localized negative pressure. The USAMMA has identified a need for a NPWT for use by troops in deployed environments.
