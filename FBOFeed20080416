<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) plans to award a contract to Iridium for space situational awareness (SSA) analysis, not to exceed a period of performance from 1 April 2008 to 1 April 2009 (1 year).  Approximate value for this effort is estimated at $500K.
The intent is to award a sole source contract to Iridium under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  This SSA study contract will support the analysis of capabilities and concepts within the context of the Iridium satellite constellation and planned constellation replenishment.  The study will address Size Weight & Power (SWaP) factors for hosting secondary payloads and technical means to provide timely precision global SSA coverage with assured data distribution and handling.  The Iridium constellation represents the most likely implementation to meet the above stated requirements.

The Government believes Iridium is the only company capable of providing the government's requirement for analysis and data/information that describes the current approach and concept of operations of the Iridium satellite service, without interruption in schedule or service, due to their unique knowledge of the Iridium satellite.  Award to any other source would result in an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the requirement and substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  All interested parties can submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) no longer than 10 pages and containing the following information: technical description of the offeror's experience and knowledge of the Iridium constellation and planned constellation replenishment.  To mitigate schedule risks, interested parties must have direct access and knowledge of the Iridium platform and full capabilities.  All interested parties must show capability to process and handle government equipment and information up to, and including SECRET.  SOCs should be sent to SYSW/PK, Attn: Ms. Kristy Kuhlman or e-mailed to kristy.kuhlman.ctr@losangeles.af.mil and received by 1:00 P.M, PST, on 05 March 2008.  Submittals that contain classified materials must be coordinated with either the primary or secondary points of contact.  No contract award will be made on the basis of offers or proposals received in response to this notice.  The NAICS code for this announcement is 541310 with the applicable size standard of $4.5M.  Any business in this area of expertise will be allowed to participate in the submittal of SOC's.  Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.  However, all businesses should be capable of meeting the above requirements at the time of submitting SOC's.  

BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations regarding this acquisition to the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of white papers or the source selection process for this acquisition. The Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill, phone number (310) 653-1789.  Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the contracting officer, Ms. Ann Birbeck (310) 535-2634.

<DESC>C.1.1.  	Purpose of Contract:
The purpose of this indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract is to establish the fundamental requirements to be performed as an Education Contract - Medicaid Integrity Contractor (MIC) (hereinafter, referred to as the Contractor) when directed in individual task orders.  The fundamental requirements are to educate providers of services, managed care entities, Medicaid beneficiaries and other individuals about Medicaid program integrity and quality of care.  The education/ training may take place in any State (including the District of Columbia and the territories) that is receiving Federal funds under Medicaid.
 
C.1.2. 	Objective:
The Contractor shall promote the integrity of the Medicaid program by educating providers of services, managed care entities, Medicaid beneficiaries and other individuals about Medicaid program integrity and quality of care.  This may take the form of production, review, editing, and/or distributing educational materials, classroom instruction, and awareness campaigns etc.  The specific education or training to meet the Governments need shall be determined at any time during the term of this contract.  Educational efforts must emphasize reduction of risks to Medicaid program integrity and quality of care that were identified by a wide variety of sources, including but not limited to, self assessments, reviews, audits and data analysis performed by State Agencies, Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCUs), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services - Offices of the Inspector General (DHHS-OIG), General Accountability Office (GAO), CMS Contractors including the Audit MIC and Review of Provider MIC, and other sources.  

These educational materials should be designed to:
	Educate providers, beneficiaries, and others about appropriate and accurate billings for services under the Medicaid Program,
	Include topics related to potential Medicaid fraud, waste and abuse,
	Be concise and responsive to the needs of the audience addressed,
	Have broad and nationwide application that can be widely disseminated, and
	Undertake tasks and initiatives to raise the overall awareness of the Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP) as well as the CMS contractors performing audits of providers and Medicaid data analysis.  

C.1.3.  	Background:
Medicaid was enacted in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act (the Act).  Title XIX of the Act is a Federal/State entitlement program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources.  Medicaid is a cooperative venture jointly funded by Federal Government as well as State governments (including the District of Columbia and the territories) to assist States in furnishing medical assistance to eligible needy persons.  
Within broad national guidelines established by Federal statutes, regulations, and policies, each State establishes its own eligibility standards; determines the type, amount, duration, and scope of services; sets the rate of payment for services; and administers its own program.  State participation in Medicaid is voluntary; however, all States have chosen to participate.  The Federal government supports state administration by providing matching funds and establishing general programmatic guidelines.  

C.1.4.	The Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005:
Section 6034 of the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005, signed February 8, 2006, established the Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP).  The MIP offers a unique opportunity to identify, recover, and prevent inappropriate Medicaid payments.  The DRA also requires MIP to provide effective support and assistance to States to combat potential Medicaid fraud, waste and abuse.

Description 

     The Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Headquarters is seeking a contractor under full and open competition to conduct studies on the impact of climate change on the National Flood Insurance Program and to determine whether policies and methodologies for mapping coastal special flood hazard areas should be revised.   This involves three different (albeit related) studies or analyses to be performed.  They include: (1) a study recommended by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) that would analyze the impact of climate change on the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP); (2) concerns regarding the use of the primary frontal dune in determining the landward boundary of Velocity (V) Zones; and (3) questions regarding whether the NFIP should map and manage coastal A Zones separately from riverine A Zones and develop insurance rates that are specific to this new insurance class. 

The government intends to use performance-based contracting methods for this procurement. In addition, in awarding this contract, the government will use the procedures established in FAR Part 15. It is anticipated that the period of performance will be 18 months from the date of contract award.

<DESC>Purpose of the Contract<BR>Strength Maintenance Divisions mission is to provide policies, programs, procedures, and guidance to the States and Territories to meet their end-strength objectives in accordance with the Strength Maintenance Philosophy. This philosophy is to recruit quality soldiers, conduct attrition management designed to reduce first-term soldier losses and training pipeline losses, and ensure retention and extension of quality soldiers before the expiration of their term-of-service.<B R>The Strength Maintenance Philosophy builds a partnership for strength readiness between unit leaders and the recruiting and retention force. Working together, they can develop programs and incentives to meet the units strength objectives. There are thre e strength maintenance tenets:<BR>a.  Recruiting Quality Soldiers,<BR>b.  Retaining Quality Soldiers, and<BR>c.  Managing Attrition.<BR>The purpose of this contract is to acquire contractor support services to continue, improve, and develop innovative Army  National Guard Strength Maintenance Division (NGB-ASM) Recruitment and Retention programs.<BR><BR>Statement of Need<BR>The Army National Guard Strength Maintenance Division (NGB-ASM) requires contractor support services to continue, improve, and develop i nnovative Recruiting and Retention programs. These Recruitment and Retention programs respond to ARNGs foremost goal, which is to attain and maintain congressionally authorized end-strength.<BR>Currently, NGB-ASM contract service support uses various cont racting vehicles executed by multiple contractors. In contrast NGB-ASM desires to address the situation by having one integration contractor as the single focal point.  Simultaneously, NGB-AQ Contracting Division wants to introduce post-award competition b etween multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) services contractors to obtain improved cost and technical product. This situation also presents an opportunity to incorporate a partial small business set-aside among the multiple IDIQ awards.   NGB-ASM requires a solution that addresses both the single focal point and the competition requirements. <BR><BR>The integration contractor scenario addresses the NGB-ASM need for a single focal point to monitor all program activities, perform strategic market analysis, support strategic decision making, collect and report program performance metrics, and ensure consistent application of an overall consistent branding and message theme as determined in the Advertising contract. Basically the integrator se rves as NGB-ASMs Recruitment and Retention Program Management Office. The integrator is a mediator between NGB-ASM and the five IDIQ services contractors: it supports the NGB-ASM in evaluating the IDIQ services contractors technical and cost task proposa ls; it reviews all programs for NGB-ASM to ensure consistent branding and messaging irrespective of  the services contractor; it collects, analyzes, and reports services contractor performance metrics for NGB-ASM evaluation; when required, it supports NGB- ASM in preparing data to respond to Department of Defense and Congressional inquiries; and it performs unbiased strategic market analysis from a perspective that is independent from the IDIQ services contractors to support NGB-ASM strategic decision-making . <BR>NGB-ASM obtains support from any of the five IDIQ services contractors on a task order basis. As envisioned the five IDIQ services contractors have to compete for work by 1) submitting technical and cost proposals in response to NGB-ASM task requirem ents, or 2) submitting original proposals based on their own initiative. NGB-ASM, with support from the integration contractor, evaluates the proposals and awards the task to the service contractor who, based on their informed judgment, provides best value  to the Government.<BR><BR>NGB-ASM has determined that using two types of contractsone a single award contract with an integration contractor and another multi ple award IDIQ contract with five contractorsis the most effective way to achieve NGB-ASM goals. The integration contractor will institute a permanent organization staffed with full time subject matter experts, specialists, and managers. The IDIQ services  contractors will develop and implement a comprehensive set of programs that helps ASM meet their objectives. Each IDIQ contractor will be able to team with outside subcontractors and vendors to round out the full complement of skills required by this soli citation.<BR><BR>Consistent with performance-based contracting practices, NGB will define the work in terms of objectives rather than specific tasks. As a result, it then becomes the offerors responsibility to propose how the stated objectives would be ac hieved and to define the metrics to measure performance. Offerors may propose for the integration contractor role or the IDIQ services contractor role, but not both. The integration contractor acquisition will result in one contract being awarded under the  Small Business Administrations 8(a) Business Development program.<BR><BR>SET ASIDE CONSIDERATIONS<BR>1.   Integration Contract.  Procurement for Integration Contractor shall be set aside for competition among 8(a) vendors<BR> <BR>2.  IDIQ Service Provide rs Contracts.  If the Government receives 2 or more acceptable proposals from Small Businesses, the Government will award two or more IDIQ Service Provider Contracts to Small Business entities.   All other IDIQ Service Provider Contracts will be considered  full and open.<BR><BR><BR>INTEGRATION CONTRACTOR<BR>a.  Minimum Guaranteed Funding Amount: The contractor shall receive a minimum of $25,000 over the life of the contract. This is the total amount that will be paid to the contractor in the event that the total sum of all task orders issued under the contract does not equal the minimum amount specified.<BR>b.  Maximum Contract Amount: The total maximum contract amount is $33 million in task orders over the life of the contract. The contract establishes a to tal contract maximum capacity, without subdividing the capacity any further. <BR><BR>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES (INTERGRATION)<BR>C-1	GENERAL<BR>C-1.1	Background<BR>The National Guard Bureaus Army Strength Maintenance Divisions (NGB-ASM) mission is to provi de policies, programs, procedures, and guidance to the states and territories to meet their end-strength objectives in accordance with the Strength Maintenance Philosophy. Specifically, to recruit quality soldiers, conduct attrition management designed to reduce first-term soldier losses and training pipeline losses, and ensure retention and extension of quality soldiers before the expiration of their term-of-service.<BR>The Strength Maintenance Philosophy builds a partnership for strength readiness between  unit leaders and the recruiting and retention force. Working together, they can develop programs and incentives to meet each units strength objectives. There are three strength maintenance tenets:<BR>?	RecruitingRecruiting Quality (Non-Prior and Prior S ervice) Soldiers,<BR>?	RetentionRetaining Soldiers who reach their Expiration Term of Service (ETS, and<BR>?	Attrition ManagementReducing Losses While Still Under Contractual Military Obligation.<BR>As part of these activities, the Army National Guard al so has a related objective, which is to capture and improve access to performance data and program data.<BR>The interaction of the NGB Army Strength Maintenance processes of Recruiting, Retention, and Attrition Management are shown in the following diagram . This diagram indicates the flow of combat-ready soldiers within the National Guard. It indicates how the processes of recruiting, retention, and attrition affect the end-strength objective. The Army National Guard has multiple related yearly objectives t hat it uses to while managing these processes to achieve the congressionally mandated end-strength objective.<BR>To support these three tenets, the NGB-ASM requ ires contractor support services to continue, improve, and expand current efforts and to create and develop innovative Recruitment and Retention programs.

The integration contractor will institute a permanent organization staffed with full time subject matter experts, specialists, and managers. The IDIQ services contractors will develop and implement a comprehe nsive set of programs that helps ASM meet their objectives. Each contractor will be able to team with outside subcontractors and vendors to round out the full complement of skills required by this solicitation.<BR>Consistent with performance-based contract ing practices, NGB-ASM will define the work in terms of objectives rather than specific tasks. As a result, it is then becomes the Offerors responsibility to propose how the stated objectives would be achieved and to define the metrics to measure performa nce. Offerors may propose for the integration contractor role or the IDIQ services contractor role, but not both.<BR>C-2.

<CONTACT>Susan A Nsangou, Phone 301-443-2104, Email nsangous@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland for development of an instrument for assessing mental health systems and services in more than 190 developing countries. Ten countries will be selected based on geographic representation as well as the ability and readiness of the countries to implement projects to improve the mental health systems of their countries based on WHO results. A detailed project proposal will be developed for each of the 10 selected countries. The plan will describe specific activities to be undertaken, responsibilities for carrying out these activities, and an estimate of the needed resources.  The action plan will be developed in consultation with the Ministry of Health and the local and regional WHO Offices.  The plan will include an identification of the resources needed for strengthening the mental health system and services according to the plan. The period of performance is 8 months.
The WHO is the international public health agency with years of experience working to improve health and living standards for people around the world.  They conducted the original assessments of the status of 190 countries policies, services, resources, and personnel in mental health and published and widely distributed this information in a document titled, Atlas:  Country Profiles on Mental Health Resources (2001).  In addition, they have already identified collaborators in designated countries to work with them on this project and have received support for the project from both the WHO organization and Council and the Ministers of Health.  They have both the credibility and expertise to carry out this project in all six WHO regions of the world.    

Therefore based on the aforementioned facts, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements FAR 6.302-1.  The Government intends to select and evaluate and award the offer that represents the best value to the Government, price and all other factors considered.  The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI486136 may be submitted to the NIDA, SS/SA Branch, 31 Center Drive, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892, Attention: Susan A. Nsangou, Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV)has a need to identify and develop manipulator and end effector technologiesthat may ultimately be implemented across a future family of Joint ExplosiveOrdnance Disposal (EOD) unmanned ground vehicles (UGV).  BACKGROUND:  The numberof UGVs in use by Joint EOD forces has increased dramatically since thebeginning of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).While the three UGV models that comprise the current Joint EOD UGV fleet haveproven to be effective and suitable, there is much room for improvement,especially with respect to manipulators and end effectors.  The currentmanipulators share no commonality across the three UGV models, resulting in arelatively large logistics footprint.  The end effectors employed are simple"claws" with acceptable but limited capability.  There is no modularity withineach UGV model's manipulator, which eliminates the possibility ! of mission-specific configurations and makes repair at the user leveldifficult.  Finally, multiple end effectors that can be changed out remotely asneeded during a mission are not available and would be difficult to implementgiven the designs of the current manipulators.  TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT:Interested firms are requested to submit white papers/proposals that define aneffort to develop a manipulator and end effectors that are modular in nature andcan be scaled larger or smaller in order to achieve commonality across differentweight classes of future Joint EOD UGVs.  The effort will culminate with thedelivery of a prototype that is expected to have a technological maturity of atleast Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6.  A complete technical data package forthe prototype that will enable the transition of the technology to a potentialfuture Joint EOD UGV program of record will also be delivered.  The Governmentwill test the prototype in a high-fidelity laborat! ory environment or in a simulated operational environment to verify the attainment of TRL 6.  Monthly status updates that include projectaccomplishments, status, issues, risks, future plans will be provided throughoutthe effort.  Also, two formal design reviews will be conducted at appropriatepoints during the effort.  EOD MANIPULATION TASKS:  Common tasks that areperformed remotely using Joint EOD UGV manipulators and end effectors are:placement/positioning of EOD tools, picking up unexploded ordnance, openingdoors, digging, and application of common hand tools and power tools (e.g.drills and saws).  WHITE PAPERS: Interested offerors are requested to submit awhite paper, the purpose of which is to preclude unwarranted effort by theOfferor in preparing a full technical and cost proposal that would not beconsidered responsive to requirements.  Each white paper is limited to fivepages and shall consist of three primary areas: Technical, Management, and Cost.The Technical section shall consist of clear descriptions of objectives, te! chnical issues which must be resolved to accomplish objectives, approach toresolving these issues, and particular prior experience of the Offeror in thetargeted technology area(s).  The Management section shall include keypersonnel, experience, facilities and a plan of action with milestones.  TheCost section shall include a cost breakdown of the effort being proposed.  Theperiod of performance shall not exceed eighteen (18) months in length and thetotal cost shall not exceed $750,000.  White papers shall be submitted not laterthan 3:00 PM (EDT) on 15 May 2008.  It is anticipated that the evaluation of thewhite papers will be completed and the results disseminated to offerors by 5June 2008.  FULL PROPOSALS:  The Government will request full proposals based onthe merits of the white papers received.  Full proposals will not be limited asto the number of pages and shall consist of three sections, Technical,Management, and Cost.  All sections shall reference the BA! A number and include the Offeror's project title.  Proposals submitted shall include the following:  (a) statement of work (SOW) detailing scope ofwork and a detailed description of each task; (b) list of Government furnishedinformation and Government furnished equipment (GFE) required; (c) a detailedcost breakdown by task including labor categories, labor rates, labor hours,labor overhead rate and total labor cost.  If subcontractors are involved,include a cost breakdown for each subcontractor exhibiting the same parameters.Subcontractors may send their details separately or they may provide them alongwith the prime in a sealed envelope.  Also include material cost, travel and anyother direct or indirect costs.  If the Offeror has an approved purchasingsystem, provide the source and date of latest review.  If the Offeror does nothave an approved purchasing system, state what processes are used for purchasesof such items as material, travel, and training; (d) a description ofdeliverables; (e) a schedule including milestones and a ! time/cost profile; (f) a description of the Offeror's facilities, key personneland experience in the area of interest.  It is anticipated that full proposalswill be due in the June/July 2008 timeframe.  The Government intends to issueawards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the bestoverall value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to selectfor award some portion(s) of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  Inthat event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of agiven proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued underthis BAA.  EVALUATIONS:  White papers and full proposals will be evaluated usingthe following selection criteria, which are listed in descending order ofimportance:  (1) Overall scientific and technical merits; (2) Understanding ofEOD requirements and the technical/scientific innovation and risk to solve therequirement; (3) Potential for transition to fleet! /field capability; (4) The Offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integralfactors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) Potential capability gainedby EOD; (6) Proposed cost and fees.  SMALL BUSINESS: The socio-economic meritsof each proposal seeking a procurement contract will be evaluated in the contextof the requirements described in this announcement. The evaluation process willconsider the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontractingopportunities for small businesses, HUB Zone small businesses, smalldisadvantaged businesses, woman-owned small business concerns, veteran-ownedsmall businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and minorityinstitutions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code forthis solicitation, 541710 (which corresponds with the standard industrialclassification code of 8731), specifies a small business size standard of 500employees or less. A Small Business Subcontracting Plan prepared i! n accordance with FAR 52.219-9 must accompany contract proposals (fullproposals) that exceed $500,000 submitted by all but small businesses. Entitiesthat must submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan for contract proposalsthat exceed $500,000 include universities/colleges, nonprofits, and largebusinesses. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and MinorityInstitutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and/or join others insubmitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside for HBCUand MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete orfunctionally separable areas of this technology for exclusive competition amongthese entities.  SUBMISSIONS: White papers/full proposals shall be submittedelectronically to Jim Knesel at james.e.knesel@navy.mil.  The BAA number must beincluded in the email subject line.  Each Offeror should submit a cover pagewith its white paper/proposal.

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to issue, on a competitive basis, Solicitation N00024-08-R-2310 for the development of a US Navy Ship Contract Portfolio Cash Flow Analysis Model.  This model will assess the impact of variations in the US Navys Ship Contract Portfolio and contract schedule and cost performance, on the shipbuilding contractors cash flow and rates of return.  The model will permit the user to analyze negotiable contract variables, such as differing contract types, progress payment!  retentions, and profit structures, which could impact corporate cash flow.  It is the Governments intent to contract with a Historically Black College, University or Minority Institution.  The contracted effort will encompass all the manpower, support, and associated technical data and documents required to develop and deliver the Ship Contract Portfolio Cash Flow Analysis Model.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Specifically, this effort involves the design and developmentof mathematical models and instrumentation for operation of a scintillometerat up to 180km range and the test/evaluation of the scintillometer using threeidentified path lengths.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes.  Adetermination by the Government not to compete based upon responses tothis notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Authority forOther-Than-Full and Open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1,only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfyagency requirements.  Based on UCF developing the complete theory ofatmospheric parameters on a propagating laser beam and recentexperimentation with this approach of complete scintillation characterizationofpaths up to 1km, the government has determined that UCF is the only concernthat can perform these services.  The use of any other source for thisacquisition would result in the duplication of cost and time to develop thetechnical capability within another contractor's workforce, which would resultinsubstantial duplication of costs that are not expected to be recovered throughcompetition.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System(NAICS) Code is 541712; the size standard is 500 employees.  The anticipatedperiod of performance will be approximately 12 months; with a total estimatedvalue of 750,000 dollars.

*******************************************PROGRAM SCOPE: The Joint Terminal Controller Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) project under the Tactical Airborne Control System funds developments necessary to provide Distributed Mission Operations (DMO) capable high-fidelity Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC), and Combat Control Team (CCT) training and rehearsal system. The JTC TRS will be able to connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity close air support platforms and JTACs/CCT teams to train together. The JTC TRS will enable operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS) training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the system will be capable of providing air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application of austere airbase operations. Using a system of systems approach JTC TRS shall have the capability to network in Increment 1 to aircrew full mission trainers and mission training centers, and by Increment 2, to Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) for Joint Tactical Air Strike Requests and air-ground coordination of Joint fires. JTC TRS will also allow JTACS/CCT teams to use their actual equipment in the trainer. Its primary focus is to provide a persistent total air-ground virtual training environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal capability that will develop both JTAC/CCT skills and train those air crews assigned to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to ground forces. JTC TRS will be fully interoperable with joint/sister Service air ground simulation using industry standards. SEE BELOW ATTACHMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

<DESC>The Bureau of the Public Debts on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security-Office of the Inspector General (DHS-OIG) is conducting market research to determine sources capable of information technology IT) audit services.

The Contractor shall provide the following services:
 1.  External Vulnerability Test:

Leverage security expertise, best-of-breed tools, and extensive field experience to discover and document security exposures that could be used to infiltrate a components network.

2.  Internal Vulnerability Scanning:

Determine the vulnerability of critical assets and provide an understanding of the relative impact an exploitation may have on business continuity.
			
An Internal Assessment includes:

	Network Technical Testing  A comprehensive vulnerability scan of the in-scope servers and network devices using automated scanning tools, including network  and database scanner tools to identify known vulnerabilities  Backdoors, Security Patch Level, CGI-Bin, Email, Web, FTP.
	Operating System Testing   Analysis of various components in identified operating systems using automated tools, including Internet Scanner to identify known  vulnerabilities  Backdoors, Security Patch Levels, file permissions, registry permissions, operating system and Web server configurations, file system access control, services, sub-systems, network configurations, event logging.
	Database Testing  Conduct a series of technical checks on a sampling of Oracle, Microsoft SQL and Sybase databases using Database Scanner to identify known vulnerabilities  default accounts, user accounts, stored procedures, user permissions, password strength, event logging, patch levels.


3.  External Penetration Testing

Network Discovery and Reconnaissance
Conduct network discovery testing of the network ranges as defined in the audit scope.
Perimeter or Internal Attack
Following reconnaissance, key vulnerabilities are exploited on perimeter or internal systems.
Remote Exploitation
Use avenues provided in the previous tasks to attempt further penetration into the network. It is extremely common that access obtained within a DMZ network can be leveraged to gain additional access indirectly. This task highlights that it is not only critical that DMZ or extranets be logically separated from internal segments, but that all information and data on external networks maintain a logical separation as well.

4.  Application Assessment

During this assessment, the Advanced Technology Division we perform the following tasks:

Information Gathering
In order to test a custom application, it is critical that Advanced Technology Division fully understand the application and its basic design.
	Technical Testing
After the comprehensive review of the application, begin the technical testing phase. Apply the assessment testing methodology for all applications.  The methodology was designed to cover all aspects of application security
Application Testing 
 Testing will leverage commercial application scanning tools, as well as an internal tool suite to identify potential weaknesses in the application.  Many application-layer vulnerabilities manifest as a result of simple logic-flow issues, based on poor design.

5.  Security Architecture Review
Assess current network security measures as they compare to security best practices, business objectives and regulatory requirements.

6.  Host Build Assessment

Leverage security expertise, best-of-breed tools, and extensive field experience to discover and document security exposures that could be used to infiltrate a components network.

7.  Firewall & Router Configuration Review

Assess current configurations for in-scope firewalls and other devices, and conduct a comparison to security best practices and business objectives.

8.  Security Policy Review

Evaluate existing security policies, procedures and practices in relation to NIST standards, regulatory requirements and current agency objectives.

9.  Social Engineering Assessment

Attempt to discover sensitive company information by acting as a trusted internal employee or an untrusted user.

10 Wireless Penetration Testing

The goal of this task is to assess the physical and logical wireless network environment to test the security of the network design and implementation.

	Identify, test and report the strengths and weaknesses of the WLAN
	Review the security capabilities and configuration of the implemented access points
	Verify the level of security prohibiting access by unauthorized associates and devices
	Verify the level of security to prohibit access by the general public
	Verify the level of security to guard against network attacks (i.e. hackers)
	Recommend improvements to the current Wireless Network Security Standards

Scope and Mission:  This announcement covers a systems technology which is a transformation dual use approach for operational medicine and biodefense, designed to rapidly detect and identify a wide range of pathogens.  It is intended to overcome two diagnostic challenges to discriminate between diverse pathogens that present similar to flu-like symptoms; and screen rapidly, accurately and simultaneously across multiple 20-100+ candidate pathogens.  This technology will use sophisticated, molecular biology procedures, bio-informatics, and connectivity to provide commanders at all levels the information needed to make time-critical decisions.  Ultimately this situational awareness provides a high likelihood that correct diagnostic decision will be made, even prior to the onset of symptoms.  
Background:  The importance of rapid detection of biological pathogens for both common and bio-warfare agents is well documented, embedded in several Joint Requirement documents, including CJCS Force Health Protection, Joint War fighting S&T Plan, 2003, and most recently the Department of Homeland Security PD 10 and 18. COCOMs need the ability to detect biological events/attacks in near real time to project (warn, treat, and respond) forward forces, garrisoned troops, and forces at embarkation, and debarkation.

Performance Objectives:  The offeror/contractor is requested to address in writing how the company's technology is capable of meeting the following provisions: 
a. The system must be able to perform up to 100 tests or detect 100 targets simultaneously on a single sample.
b. The system must provide rapid results within 90 minutes from sample input to answer.
c. The system must be able to test both clinical and environmental samples including: Nasal and throat swabs, Nasal aspirates, Blood, Stool, Urine, Wounds, Liquid and solid food samples, Vectors such as mosquitoes and ticks, Environmental swab samples, and Environmental powder samples.	 
d. The processed sample must be contained across the analysis process and the system must integrate minimal contamination through the use of a closed, self-contained consumable to prevent amplicon decontamination and provide easy disposal of biohazard us material.
e. The system must integrate the entire work flow with an intuitively easy-to-use and difficult to misuse systems concept from sample input to answer, including automated sample preparation, analysis and reporting.
i. The sample preparation component can be a separate unit to accommodate different sample matrices to support optimal sample processing and extraction efficiency.
ii. The system must be able to  decontaminable. 
f. The system must have moderate to high sample throughput flexibility with the capacity to test at least 12 samples simultaneously at any given time.
g. The system must have sample input flexibility with Random Access capability to input and begin testing up to 12 different samples independently at any interval.
h. The system must have integrated IT capability to track patient information and demographics to sample, including the ability to interface bi-directionally with a laboratory information system.
i. The system must be able to generate test reports electronically in a standardized method with patient or sample information and the ability to transmit results electronically.
j. The system must be robust and easily re-locatable without requiring realignment or calibration after moving.
k. The system must be able to detect RNA and DNA organisms simultaneously from the same sample. 
l. The system must have nucleic acid detection sensitivity and specificity equivalent to real-time TaqMan PCR.
m. The system must be a competitively priced with an inexpensive consumable.
n. For those applications that meet the definition of an In-Vitro Diagnostic, the manufacturer must address their plans for FDA approval for the In-Vitro Diagnostic (IVD). (In vitro diagnostic products are those reagents, instruments, and systems intended for use in diagnosis of disease or other conditions, including a determination of the state of health, in order to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease or its sequelae. Such products are intended for use in the collection, preparation, and examination of specimens taken from the human body." [21 CFR 809.3])
o. Ideally the system/platform will utilize FDA cleared technology for analytical measurement to facilitate In-Vitro diagnostic applications.
p. The following capabilities of the test system are desirable but not mandatory:
i. The system can be used to test for both nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein agents simultaneously from the same sample consistent with the requirements above for nucleic acid testing.
ii. Internal controls will be integrated into the consumable and will not require processing or input separately from the test sample.
iii. Consumable reagents will be stable for 12 months at ambient temperature.
iv. The system will be operable by a single technician.
v. The system will have a footprint of < 15 ft2.
The offeror's response needs to provide at a minimum, all areas in the criteria section above. The input will help Air Force ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity of all potential offerors. A review of North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) codes finds that NAICS 541711 (Research and Development in Biotechnology) has a size standard of 500 employees. Comments on NAIC code selection are welcome.

<DESC>FDA-SOL-08-00623
This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of certified Small Businesses to identify and develop a knockout mouse for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Government is seeking qualified Small Businesses.  This is planned as a Small Business SET ASIDE on a competitive basis.

The purpose is to have sources that can develop and provide knockout mice during the 15-24 month study.  The vendor performance period will be two years.  Due to a diminishing number of available ivermectin-sensitive Collie colonies, it is becoming difficult for drug sponsors to get the dogs needed to test the safety of new avermectins.  Therefore alternative screening procedures are needed to identify potential P-gp substrates and to address safety concerns.  The second phase of the study will develop alternative in vivo and in vitro models that may be used in lieu of ivermectin-sensitive Collies to confirm the safety of new and combination new animal drug products.  By the end of the second year, FDA plans to have identified in vitro systems that can be used to identify P-gp substrates.  However, since in vivo toxicity and tissue variation in gene expression need to be considered, an in vivo model is also needed.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Food and VendingMachine Services Concession Agreement.	This notice is a Request for Information (RFI)and supersedes the RFI NNG08GEWA issued by NASA for similar services that originallyposted on 11/27/07. The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) at Greenbelt, MD conducts, among otherthings, space and earth science research, engineering, spacecraft integration andtesting, and mission support.  GSFC currently provides for the operation of 2 fullservice cafeterias (Building 1 and Building 21) and a vending service in most, but notall**, of its facilities at Greenbelt.	It has an approximate on-site population of 8,000 10,000 civil servants and contractors combined - as well as other seasonal workers,such as summer students, and visitors.	The NASA GSFC facility permits its organizationsto have their own coffee messes, to include beverages and products, maintained on aninformal, local, and relatively small level.The building 21 cafeteria is approximately 10,336 square feet with a seating capacity of402. The Building 1 cafeteria is a smaller facility, approximately 5,258 square feet witha seating capacity of approximately 200.  The current hours of operation for both are7:30 AM to 2:00 PM. In addition, there are approximately 141 vending machines located in34 buildings throughout the Center and a mobile snack bar which makes approximately 26stops.A list of Government-owned equipment available to the vendors is attached to this notice. NASA/GSFC does not own or maintain any of the vending machines.The operations are arranged through a concession agreement, executed and managed forGoddard by its Goddard Employee Welfare Association (GEWA), which is a non-appropriatedfund instrumentality of NASA, authorized under the National Aeronautics and Space Act of1958, as amended.  Goddard reserves the right to assign execution and managementresponsibility to GEWA or to another Goddard organization, at its sole discretion, at anytime.The facilities as are often the case, are aging.  The Center will be issuing acompetitive solicitation for award of combined vending/food service operations for aperiod of up to 10 years.  In developing performance specifications and scoring plan forthe solicitation, the Center is interested in receiving meaningful input as to how thesefacilities may be used to offer quality food and vending services to the personnelon-site at Goddards Greenbelt campus. The Center by this release is soliciting your comments and ideas to assist in creating acompetitive environment where quality services are assured, and encouraging innovativeapproaches to the use of these facilities.  Services should provide value (quality foodat reasonable prices) and range of selections, as well as provide attractiveenvironments, which will encourage employees to meet and collaborate while using thesefacilities.  The Center understands that such approaches may be limited by the currentcondition of its facilities and equipment. Therefore, the Center is also interested inthose modifications to equipment and facilities, including relocation of equipment, whichare minimally necessary to enable the approaches, and how those modifications can befunded through a business case.  Finally, any approaches should also identify existingoperations the contractor has demonstrated to be viable. It is the Centers current feeling that the Building 1 cafeteria, along with the Librarynoted below, offer greater opportunities for innovative services, such as a cyber-cafand/or a deli/bistro operation attractive for casual use by customers while readingpapers, viewing laptops, or having small group conversations.  However, the Center is notlimited to this view if viable alternatives for a set of comprehensive food services arepossible.In addition to the above facilities, the Center is considering making available a portionof what is now its Library in Building 21, with minimal furnishings thereof, if there areviable proposals for an alternative service in the conversion of that space to acollaborative facility such as a cyber-caf.  This has not been part of the previousconcession arrangements at the Center.There should be an assumption that no center funds will be provided to upgrade facilitiesand equipment, except for minimal furnishings in the Library, if such is included in theactual solicitation.  Interested participants will be provided an on-site tour of thefacilities on 4/28/08.	Those persons interested in this tour must email their request totheresa.a.stevens@nasa.gov by COB 4/23/08 (with full names of each individual planning toattend the site visit.	You must be a US Citizen to attend this site visit).  Questionsresulting from the tour must be submitted in writing by COB 5/2/08.  Responses to allquestions will be posted to NAIS by COB 5/9/08.  Each potential offerors comments,innovative approaches, etc. which may include concession terms and conditions necessaryto enable facility and/or equipment upgrade are due by 4:30 p.m. local time on05/16/2008.The Center recognizes the need of any potential Offeror to protect information whichprovides specific approaches to meeting the Centers requirements.  This is particularlythe case involving innovative approaches to the use of Center facilities, which have notbeen available at the Center previously.  Therefore, the Center intends to protect thespecific description of any innovative use identified in response to this Request ForInformation, as well as associated terms and conditions (e.g. specific investmentstrategies), while reserving the right to: 1) modify its statement of requirements tocharacterize, through a set of performance-based requirements, services to be required inuse of the identified facilities; and 2) identify an evaluation and scoring plan, whichgives the Center maximum ability to give credit for viable, innovative approaches, whilebalancing the need for reasonable product pricing and high quality food products.  TheCenter shall only consider release of such limited-rights information outside of theGovernment in response to a request submitted under the Freedom of Information Act, 5U.S.C. 552, and shall provide the necessary analysis required under NASAs regulations at14 CFR Part 1206 in order to reflect the status of such data as proprietary to thesubmitter.  Such specific descriptions are considered to be proprietary to the submitteruntil award of the contemplated concession agreement, at which time there shall be nofurther obligation on the part of the Government to protect such information.	 ** Randolph-Sheppard operations are provided outside the concession agreement forBuilding 33 and are expected to be provided for Building 34 when completed.  Thosebuildings are excluded from the provision of the concession agreement. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities, qualifications, innovations andideas to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than4:30 p.m. local time on 05/16/2008. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.Prospective offerors are invited to submit written comments or questions to: ContractSpecialist Theresa Stevens via electronic transmission at Theresa.A.Stevens@nasa.gov orby facsimile transmission at 301-286-1649, no later than 4:30 p.m. on 05/02/2008.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)

HYDRAULIC CYLINDER PACKING FOR AIRCRAFT ARRESTING ENGINE COMPONENTS  

 

Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division

Lakehurst, NJ

 

 

This is a Request For Information (RFI).  There is no solicitation available at this time.  

 

The Naval Air Systems seeks information and/or proposals from potential sources for a replacement hydraulic cylinder packing.  

 

As aircraft land aboard US aircraft carriers, they stop by capturing a cable with their "Tail Hook" and pulling the cable through a hydraulic cylinder based arresting engine.  This engine transfers the energy from the airplane into the fluid, thus bringing the airplane to a stop.  There are several hydraulic cylinders within this system that require packing to seal the high pressure fluid within the cylinders.

 

Currently, NAVAIR uses a Chevron style V-ring packing made of neoprene on all engine components.  The hydraulic fluid is ethylene glycol based.  If the gland is not shimmed properly, there could either be excessive drag on the piston or the gland could leak under pressure.  A self energized style of packing may be more reliable in these situations.  

 

The initial component being considered is called the Anchor Damper.  The piston rod diameter is 3.872 inches, the packing gland diameter is 5.000 inches and the packing length is 1.80 inches.  The maximum stroke of the piston is 192 inches.  The maximum speed is 515 inches/sec.  The peak momentary pressure is 12,500 psi, dropping to 10,000 psi.  The event duration is 3 seconds.  After each event, the system is reset and made ready for another event.  The pressure while in this ready condition is 400 psi.  When the system undergoes maintenance, the pressure will drop to zero psi.  The minimum time between events is 30 seconds.  The only requirements for any new packing is that it be compatible with the parameters above and seal under pressures from 0 thru 15,000 psi..  No  modification to existing components is being considered beyond the possible addition of spacers, if necessary.

Candidate replacements will be technically evaluated and then tested for ease of installation, life cycle and suitability for the intended equipment.  Once a candidate is deemed acceptable, there are several other sets of packing, including one that is twenty (20) inches in diameter, that this solution may be acceptable for.

All interested sources with potentially qualifying packaging systems are encouraged to respond to this Request for Information and to identify their devices, the qualifications and production status no later than 16 April 2008.  All information should be UNCLASSIFIED. Information should be forwarded to address indicated below. It is requested that information/samples be submitted NO LATER THAN 16 MAY 2008 to Ms. Letitia Baker, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (Code 2.5.2.3.1), Highway 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5082, who may be reached at (732)323-4406.  Respondents are notified that a formal solicitation MAY NOT necessarily result from this RFI.  Any comments provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to  this RFI nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. The government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to the RFI, to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend.

This project will design and construct a multi-story Headquarters building for United States Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) at Naval Support Activity, Norfolk, Virginia.  The building in this project is envisioned as the first of two phases, each involving a headquarters building of approximately the same size and function.  In this contract, Building 1 will be approximately 46,715 square feet, and contain administrative areas, space for commercial food service vendors, open storage/secret, one 300+/- SF SCIF, conference rooms, data processing areas, storage, emergency generator, and raised flooring. Site work includes required grading, landscaping, sidewalks, driveways, and roads. USJFCOM requires a high volume of communications equipment and infrastructure. Coordination is required for the determination of personnel seating, for multiple and varied departments and activities.  Based on the Storm Vulnerability Study and NSA Base criteria, Designer of Record (DOR) shall ensu! re the design of all critical equipment should be located above CAT III storm levels.  This project will also demolish Building NH-21 on same site.  Building 1 is the first of two project phases. Phase 2 will be Building 2 (not part of this contract), with approximately 41,000 SF and similar in function to Building 1.  While Building 2 is not included in this project, it will be addressed in the interest of the overall planning effort. Building 2 will incorporate a connector to Building 1 so that both buildings will function as a single facility. In some instances, elements of Building 1 will be designed or sized to accommodate Building 2 requirements, e.g., fire pump, generator, electrical distribution.  The architectural concepts for Building 1 and Building 2 shall allow the buildings to appear cohesive together, and complement the new addition to the nearby Building NH-95.

The Government will not pay for any information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  One of the main functions of this synopsis is to assist the Contracting Officer in determining whether an 8(a), HUBZone or Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-aside is an acceptable strategy for this procurement.  If a full and open competition is ultimately pursued, responses to this synopsis will be used to aid in establishing small business subcontracting goals.  All qualified firms are encouraged to respond.  The Government anticipates a contract award for this project in February 2009.  The appropriate NAICS Code is 236220 with a size standard of 31 million dollars.
It is requested that interested parties submit a brief, no more than ten (8  x 11) pages, capabilities package.  This capabilities package shall address, at a minimum the following:
1.	Examples of design build projects worked within the last five years of similar size, scope and complexity as the work indicated.

<DESC>Background:
The Office of Export Control Cooperation, Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, U.S. Department of State (ISN/ECC) oversees the U.S. Governments Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) Program.  EXBS is designed to stem proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, their delivery systems, and conventional weapons by assisting countries around the world with establishing effective export and border control systems meeting international standards.  

ISN/ECC requires contractor support with various projects across globe.  In addition to EXBS-related services, incidental equipment and supplies are required from time to time.

Overview of Requirement:
ISN/ECCs service requirements may be broken-down into four distinct activities:
Training and Exchange Support  The backbone of the EXBS program is training provided directly to foreign export control officials.  Training is routinely conducted in remote and/or dangerous locations, conducted in the local language, with all course materials provided in the local language.  Training is required in all areas of export control, especially in the following fields:
Political Commitment  Courses in this field are targeted towards senior policy makers, with the goal of securing a foreign governments commitment to establishing an effective export control system and the EXBS program.
Laws and Regulations  Courses in this field are targeted towards senior and mid-level officials, teaching them how to draft effective export control legislation and create regulations that will successfully implement that legislation.  
Licensing Procedures and Practices  Courses in this field are targeted towards senior and mid-level officials, teaching them how to establish an effective export control infrastructure that will hamper illicit proliferation of WMD.
Enforcement Techniques  This training is targeted towards mid-level and front-line customs and border enforcement personnel, law enforcement personnel, and personnel involved in the judicial process.  Once effective laws, regulations, and infrastructure have been established, courses in this field teach how to turn export control theory into practice, with a focus in interdiction of terrorism-related articles.
Industry Outreach  This training is designed to foster a close working relationship between government authorities and private industry to ensure compliance with export control laws and regulations.

1.	Assessment and Analysis Support  To help determine a given countrys need for assistance under the EXBS program, and to evaluate EXBS success within that country, ISN/ECC routinely requires independent assessments of countries export control systems.  Such assessments focus on a given countrys compliance with international standards in the export control arena, use a standard rating system to ensure that all assessments are uniform and directly comparable, and make recommendations for improving a given countrys export control system.  Assessments routinely require travel to remote and/or dangerous locations.

2.	Conference Support  To facilitate an open dialogue between countries with developing export control systems and countries with established export control systems, ISN/ECC holds periodic conferences on EXBS-related issues.  Conferences are usually held in foreign locations.  Required support includes all logistical and subject matter expertise necessary to conduct a successful EXBS-themed conference.  Typical duties include arranging for a conference venue, securing lodging for all participants, providing meals to all participants, handling travel arrangements and visa facilitation for all participants (many of whom travel from remote and/or dangerous locations), developing a conference agenda, securing suitable conference presenters and speakers, reporting on conference activities, and evaluating conference success.

3.	IT Support  The EXBS program administers several websites and complex systems, such as the TRACKER Automated Licensing System.  ISN/ECC requires comprehensive IT support in hosting, maintaining, updating, and developing websites; and with maintaining its complex systems, such as TRACKER.  Support includes help desk services for users located across the globe, patches to correct system glitches and provide system updates, training new users in system operation, and establishing and maintaining local networks in remote and/or dangerous locations to facilitate system deployment.

Contractor Qualifications:
To successfully support ISN/ECC and the EXBS program with its service requirements, potential contractors must possess the following qualifications and experience 
Ability to provide in-depth training in all fields discussed above.
Ability to provide in-depth assessments and analysis of foreign export control systems, as discussed above.
Ability to provide comprehensive conference support as discussed above.
Ability to provide all IT services as discussed above.
Ability to secure sufficient financing to satisfy multi-million dollar orders (the Government will not/not provide financing nor authorize advance payments).
Ability to satisfy several multi-million dollar orders simultaneously.
Ability to simultaneously provide all required services at diverse remote and dangerous locations across the globe (where English is not spoken) with minimal reliance upon Government resources (such as the local U.S. embassy).  Such locations include Iraq, Afghanistan, Central Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.
Ability to conduct training in a wide array of foreign languages.
Ability to translate complex legal and regulatory documentation into a wide array of foreign languages.
Expert knowledge of export control, customs enforcement, and border enforcement issues, laws, policies, trends, and techniques.
Experience operating in remote and dangerous overseas locations.
Experience successfully engaging foreign government officials on a one-on-one basis.
Experience securing value added tax (VAT) and customs duties exemptions from foreign governments. If your company is an 8(a), Small Service Disabled Veteran owned, Small Women owned, or Small Disadvantaged company and has interest in assisting the Department of States mission for the above aforementioned requirement, please submit your companys capability statement to lohereCA@state.gov.

When making contact please request acknowledgement of receipt when e-mailing Sandra Lintz at slintz@usgs.gov.  If no acknowledgement is received within 24 hours Monday through Friday, please resend your information and call Sandra at (303)236-9560 to confirm receipt of your information.  The U.S. Geological Survey, National Geospatial Technical Operating Center (NGTOC) in Denver, CO, has a requirement for an exchange network node solution and an operational NHD (National Hydrography Dataset) data flow between itself and the Minnesota Land Management Information Center (LMIC).  The scope of the project is to implement an exchange network node that provides bidirectional flow of NHD dat.  The specifics of how the inbound and outbound flows of NHD data occur must be finalized as part of the flow design.  The Exchange Network Node participates in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Environmental Information Exchange Network.  The data exchange between the Minnesota state organizations and the USGS NHD national dataset repository must utilize the EPA's data exchange network.  The node must be established within the USGS environment prior to any deployment of a data flow.  Windsor Solutions developed and implemented the node currently used by the Minnesota Land Management Information Center and is familiar with Minnesota's exchange node implementation and the NHD File Configuration Document (FCD) as well as common applications and tools.  The development and implementation must be completed by June 1, 2008.  A contractor must have experience in designing and implementing software as described herein.  Based on the information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (2), implemented by FAR 6.302-2, the Government considers the software items specified as a sole source from Windsor Solutions, Inc., Lake Oswego, Oregon and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required item/services or its functional equivalent (based upon the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement. An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, request for such document without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice to the procurement.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC><p>Synopsis: <br />Notice of Intent to award Sole Source Procurement. The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order for Jeppesen Air Transport Planning software from Jeppesen Sanderson Inc, 55 Inverness DR E, Englewood, CO 80112. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541511.
<p>This contract is for Software license for 12 copies of a modern mission planning engine capable of planning world-wide mission, full aircraft modeling algorithm, incorporate military airspace, produce flight plans compatible with E-4B avionics (Jeppesen DB), accommodate in flight fuel onloads, plan for inflight orbits, delays and holding, validate flight plans for EUROCONTROL'S CFMU, incorporate European ERAD and CRAM data to optimize routing, European OAT routing, electronically file worldwide flight plans with air traffic control, address and send flight plans to appropriate agencies, overlay current weather with projected flight path produce worldwide approach.</p>
<p>The 55th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because the Jeppesen's proprietary flight planning software (MilPlanner), mission planners and aircrews can simultaneously flight plan multiple itineraries in any region of the world, display the route of digital charts, and overlay the latest visual weather data to determine optimum routing. Jeppesen's Global Support and Control center provides the capability to compute flight plans for aircrews send those flight plans to the aircrew and coordinate with Air Traffic Control (ATC) throughout the world on a moments notice. These services can be coordinated via a computer terminal or telephone 24/7/365. The 1 ACCS cannot accomplish its mission without this service as ATC slot times and routings in Europe's airspace change continuously.</p>
<p>Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. is the only US Company that can provide world-wide navigation and charting products in the depth and detail they are provided in. These products will be provided by Jeppesen's Mission Ops eCharts and include but are not limited to departures, enroute, arrival and terminal and airport diagrams. Information on these charts includes radio aids, meteorology codes, conversion tables, local airspace entry requirements and emergency procedures. This product will integrate with Milplanner so that planners and aircrews can access these charts instantaneously when changes are made in the mission. Jeppesen Milplanner is the only product that links into the Military's Digital Aeronautical Flight Integration File.</p>

<SOLNBR>HHSN269200700002C
<RESPDATE>053008
<CONTACT>Ann G Argaman, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 594-5919, Fax (301) 594-5920, Email ann.argaman@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center, intends to negotiate a modification with Kaiser Foundation for Research, 1800 Harrison Street, 16th Floor, Oakland, California to their existing contract number HHSN269200700002C entitled An Outcome Monitoring System for Post-Acute Care Delivery.  The original contract was to test the feasibility of implementing an Outcome Monitoring System (OMS) designed for use across all post-acute care settings, among a cohort of stroke patients. Patients would be enrolled during their hospitalization for an acute stroke and followed over time. The OMS would be administered at several points to characterize a patients functional status after utilizing different PAC settings.  A secondary objective would involve an examination of outcomes of stroke patients based on their sites of care. 

This modification is to perform additional data collection using a new fixed form social/role function instrument which Kaiser will administer at 6 months post-stroke to participants enrolled in the OMS-PAC study. The instrument will be comprised of roughly 20-25 items from current calibrated item banks for social and role function scales that have been developed by Boston University HDRI.  This instrument will be added to data collection that is currently taking place at 6 months post-stroke with active research participants (totaling 250 adults over the course of the study.  By using this tool, insight will be gained into the relationship between the performance of basic tasks (such as mobility or cognition) as measured by the AM-PAC and participation in more complex social activities and roles as measured by the new social/role function instrument among adults following a stroke. This modification will also require Kaiser researchers to perform additional data collection for a sub-study of proxy and self-respondents using the AM-PAC with 25-50 research participant/proxy pairs. The sub-study will allow the Government to identify important differences in self responses to AM-PAC items compared to proxy responses and to examine potential bias in these responses. Participants who have already been enrolled in the study and are able to respond to the AM-PAC items for themselves will be paired with a proxy respondent for the sub-study. Both respondents will be administered the AM-PAC separately and their responses will be compared in subsequent statistical analyses.  

The appropriate statutory authority is 41 USC 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 5.302-1(a)(2) and FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i). The cited authority is applicable because Kaiser Foundation is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract modification. An award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The additional data collection activities under this proposed contract modification must use the same participants that are enrolled in the OMS-PAC study for data consistency, integrity, quality, interpretability and to avoid an adverse impact on the meaningfulness of the final results.. This is NOT a Request for Proposals. If however, there are any responsible sources who feel they possess the abilities which would enable them to perform the additional data collection services contemplated for this proposed modification,  they may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 45 days of this notice to Ann Argaman at the above address for consideration by the agency. Response must include detailed information clearly demonstrating the ability to meet all of these requirements.  A determination by the Government to open this requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Under the authority fo Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements," the Department of the Interior/National Business Center, on behalf of US Department of Agriculture, Risk Management Agency (RMA), intends on awarding a sole source contract to Milliman, Inc.  The overall purpose of this acquisition is to determine whether returns by crop insurance companies reinsured by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) are higher or lower than a reasonable rate of return.  To achieve this purpose the contractor shall review the reasonable rate of return previously derived and update it as necessary.  In addition, a rate of return by crop insurance companies shall also be derived and compared to the reasonable rate of return.  These analyses will be used by the USDA - Risk Management Agency (RMA) to evaluate the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) between crop insurance companies and the FCIC.
Milliman, Inc. is a well-respected consulting and actuarial firm that provides financial and actuarial analyses in the areas of property and casualty insurance, investments, financial services, healthcare, employee benefits, healthcare, and life insurance.  Milliman provides analyses to organizations including business, financial, government, union, education, and nonprofit organizations.
In 2002, Milliman, Inc. won an open and competitive bid to provide a wide-range of analyses regarding the Standard Reinsurance Agreement cited in Section 3 above.  The methodologies in two of their analyses (Reasonable Rate of Return and Historical Rate of Return) have been adopted by the RMA to determine whether profits by crop insurance companies are reasonable.
The Milliman methodology is unique in that it converts returns from a statutory accounting basis to a GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) basis.  This allows a direct comparison of Return on Equity (ROE) by other property and casualty insurance companies (or any other company filing an Annual Report).
Since the 2002 analyses, some of the data sources and available variables have changed.  As developer of the agency adopted methodologies, only Milliman, Inc. can determine how to use current data and variables within the adopted methodologies and still maintain consistency with previous analyses.  Since insurance analyses rely heavily on historical experience, it is important to maintain consistency so that changes in ROE are due to changes in actual outcomes rather than changes in methodologies.  Milliman, Inc. will provide that consistency.

<DESC>The ChillerCheck chiller is a diagnostic tool which provides critical mechanical equipment performance information and real-time data analysis on the efficiency and reliability of house chiller plant equipment in GSA controlled buildings. The diagnostic tool provides GSA Regions and Facility Managers with actionable information, in electronic and printed reports, regarding the efficiency of chiller plant operations that use the ChillerCheck software.  These reports, coupled with specific corrective measures, provided through the software, assist the Facility Managers in targeting plant operations with problems, and providing optimal cost effective and efficient remedial action.  The software also provides plant operators a communication and network tool to digitally upload logged readings and operational data from building chillers for analysis, and to transfer this content to the Contractors website via a HotSync operation.  This is accomplished through the mechanics use of the unique ChillerCheck software that is installed on handheld Palm Tungsten E2 PDA computing devices.

This procurement is for the maintenance of the ChillerCheck chiller only.

These two cutters are the CGC BERTHOLF (WMSL-750) and the CGC WAESCHE (WMSL-751) home ported at Coast Guard Island, Alameda, CA.

The Coast Guards current intent is to award a PSA contract covering both cutters.  PSA planning is not to the point where a government estimate has been developed.  However, some very preliminary rough order of magnitude estimates indicate that the total contract award for both cutters may approximate $50,000,000.   The planned contract type is Cost Plus Fixed Fee.  Work scope for each vessel will include structural modifications requiring dry docking with an overall performance period estimated at 8-10 months.  The estimated starting date for the PSA of CGC BERTHOLF is April 2010.  PSA of CGC WAESCHE will follow the completion of CGC BERTHOLF; an estimated start date will be provided at this meeting. 

The Coast Guard will provide a brief background on the National Security Cutter program, the PSA preliminary work plan, an overview of the scope of  for proposed structural modifications and associated interferences, as well as other planned work.  Time for Industry feedback and open questions will also be provided. 

This Industry Day will be held on Tuesday May 13, 2008 from 1200 to 1630 PDT in the Gresham Conference Center on Coast Guard Island  Alameda, CA.  Coast Guard Island is a controlled-access military facility.  Requirements for access to the Island for visitors are:
1. A valid State drivers license or other government-issued ID card,
2.  Current vehicle registration (if driving), and
3.  Proof of automobile liability insurance (if driving).

Delays at the access point are common, therefore you should plan to arrive at least 30 minutes early.  Potential attendees are notified that Security Personnel on Coast Guard Island can, and do, conduct searches of vehicles and individuals for contraband or prohibited items (illegal drugs, weapons, alcohol and the like) and conduct Immigration Status and Criminal Warrant Checks.  Persons in violation of access restrictions are subject to exclusion from the facility and/or detention or arrest.

Individuals wishing to attend this Industry Day must submit their name, company affiliation, position, company address, telephone number, fax, and email address to the Primary Point of Contact listed in this Notice no later than 1200 PDT Wednesday, May 7, 2008.  Please e-mail this information to Michael.t.leonard@uscg.mil .  Companies that plan on sending more than one representative can consolidate the required information into a single submission.

The Coast Guard will provide a questionnaire regarding technical and contractual issues that will need to be addressed by potential offerors.  If possible we would like to have your responses returned at Industry Day, and in any event, no later than 14 calendar days after its conclusion.  Please provide the name, title, e-mail address, and fax number of the individual in your company to receive this questionnaire.  Responses to the questionnaire shall be returned to Michael.t.leonard@uscg.mil .

<p>At L-1 Missile Alert Facility <br />Located in Colorado</p>
<p><br />Project #GHLN08-2038</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. General Scope of Work: Install 6 cameras for 360 view of MAF L-1, Monitor and uninterruptible power supply (UPS) <br />1.1. The Contractor shall furnish all parts, material, supplies, equipment, labor, and transportation necessary to accomplish work at MAF L-1 associated with F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming.</p>
<p>1.2. Installation work under this contract must be completed within 30 calendar days of notice to proceed. Work will be completed during weekdays, excluding holidays and weekends. Within 10 calendar days of contract being awarded the contactor will submit entry authorization list (EAL) information per section 10 and all equipment and data for approval.</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The purpose of the Close Circuit Television (CCTV) at the Missile Alert Facility (MAF) project is to provide sufficient 360 degree visual coverage around the MAF using CCTV camera technology as a force multiplier. These cameras will provide the Flight Security Controller (FSC) a robust situational awareness (SA) which they currently do not have. This technology will also mitigate the blind-spots caused by physical barriers outside the MAF including the MAF's topside configuration and fence line that the FSC cannot visually assess from the SCC's office windows.<br />The concept of the additional situational awareness capability is to provide FSC's and SRT's a detection method of any potential intrusion into and around the MAF and its fence line perimeter. This increased Situational Awareness will allow SF controllers to immediately assess unauthorized activities and react with a timely, tailored response force.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:</p>
<p>3.1. WORK LOCATIONS: The Missile Alert Facilities L-1 is located in the sate of Colorado within 126 statute miles of F.E. Warren AFB. L-1 is located near the town of Stoneham CO: <br />L-01 Weld County CO</p>
<p>3.2 The following list of equipment or approved equal will be installed at L-1. The contractor will submit an AF form 3000 for approval on all equipment to be installed. The CCTV system will allow the security controller to monitor all cameras on a split screen on the monitor and the ability to monitor one camera at a time. The system will alarm when a camera detect motion and bring the camera into full view on the monitor. Ensure all cameras are mounted rigidly to eliminate the cameras from moving during wind events and to eliminate sun glare. Ensure all camera's are labeled in a sequentially manner for ease of identification and operation. The location of all camera's are suggested locations and the contractor may submit proposal for different amount of camera's and different locations for consideration by the government if they feel their arrangement would better meet the intent of the Government as addressed in Section 2 and the attached drawing.</p>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) as number <strong>2008-Q-10379</strong>.<br />Any incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24.</p>
<p>This RFQ is <strong>100% set-aside for small business</strong>. The North American Industrial Classification System Code is: <strong>561720</strong> with a small business size standard of: <strong>$15 million</strong>.</p>

<p>The Specifications consist of the contractor providing ground maintenance services in accordance with the attached Statement of Work and additional information provided in attachments: CDC Clauses, Janitorial Inspection Form, Building Layout, Contractor Performance Report, Wage Determination, Past Performance Questionnaire, and Sample-Client Authorization Letter.</p>
<p>Special Instructions/Provisions:</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors apply.<br /><br />The provision at 52.212-2 Commercial Items and Evaluation - Commercial Items apply.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items apply.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />A. The Government will award a contract resulting from this Request for Quote (RFQ) to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. An award will be made on the basis of past performance and price with past performance as more important than price.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Price Proposal:<br />Pricing information shall be submitted in accordance with this (RFQ) in the appropriate spaces for each line item.</p>
<p>Past Performance:</p>
<p>Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar work. Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which offeror's relative ranking will be compared to assure best value to the government. The government may contact other references than those identified by the offeror and the information received will be used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>a.) All Offerors shall submit a separate record of the past performance information as requested below as along with this RFQ packet. The information may be submitted prior to other parts of the proposal in order to assist the Government in commencing past performance evaluations. The offeror should include the last three (3) contracts completed during the past three years and all or at least three (3) contracts currently in process for both the offeror and for all proposed major subcontractors, which are similar in nature to this requirement.</p>
<p>1.) The Contracts listed may include those with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers, which are of similar scope, magnitude, relevance, and complexity to this requirement. Offerors that are newly formed entities without prior contracts should list contracts and subcontracts as required above for predecessor companies, corporate officers, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement. The following information should be included for each contract listed:</p>
<p>1. Name of Contracting Organization;<br />2. Contract Number;<br />3. Brief description of relevance to the services required under this RFP;<br />4. Names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail address (if known) and facsimile numbers of the Contracting Officer and the Project Officer for all Government contracts. Names, addresses, telephone numbers, and facsimile numbers of private sector contacts equivalent of a Federal Government Contracting Officer and Project Officer (operation manager);<br />5. The dollar value of the contract;<br />6. Contract type (Firm-fixed price, cost-plus-fixed-fee, etc.);<br />7. Period of Performance;<br />8. Place of performance;</p>
<p>b.) Offerors should not provide general information on their performance on the identified contracts and subcontracts. General performance information will be obtained from references.<br /><br />1.) Offerors may provide information on problems encountered and corrective actions taken on the identified contracts and subcontracts.</p>
<p>2.) References that may be contacted by the Government include the contracting officer, program manager/project officer, or the administrative officer identified above.<br /><br />3.) If no response is received from a reference, the Government will make an attempt to contact another reference identified by the offeror, to contract a reference not identified by the offeror, or to complete the evaluation with those references who responded. The Government shall consider the information provided by the references, and may also consider information obtained from other sources, when evaluating an offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>4.) Attempts to obtain responses from references will generally not go beyond two telephonic messages and/or written requests from the Government, unless otherwise stated in the solicitation. The Government is not obligated to contact all of the references identified by the Offeror.</p>
<p>c.) If negative feedback is received from an offeror's reference, the Government will compare the negative response to the responses from the offeror's references to note differences. A score will be assigned appropriately to the offeror based on the information. The offeror will be given the opportunity to comment, if that information makes a difference in the Government's decision to include the offeror in or exclude the offeror from the competitive range. Any past performance deficiency or significant weakness will be discussed with offerors in the competitive range during discussions. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.</p>
<p>d.) Offerors must send Client Authorization Letters (Attachment D.6) to assist in the timely processing of the past performance evaluation. Offeror's are encouraged to consolidate requests whenever possible (i.e., if the same reference has several contracts, send that reference a single notice citing all applicable contracts). Offerors may send Client Authorization Letter electronically to references with copies forwarded to the contracting officer.</p>
<p>1.) If an offeror has no relevant past performance history, an offeror must affirmatively state it possesses no relevant past performance history.</p>
<p>2.) Client Authorization Letters should be mailed or e-mailed to individual references as early as possible, but no later then five (5) working days after proposal submission. The offeror should forward a copy of the Client Authorization Letter to the contracting officer simultaneously with mailing references.</p>
<p>e.) Past performance information will be used for both responsibility determination and as an evaluation factor for award. The Past Performance Questionnaire (Attachment D. 5) will be used to collect information on an offerors past performance under existing and prior contracts/subcontract for services similar in scope, magnitude, relevance, and complexity to this requirement in order to evaluate offerors consistent with the past performance evaluation set forth below. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government and used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance. Evaluation of past performance information will be reflected in terms of the following degrees of performance assessment:</p>
<p>+4 Excellent: A significant majority of the sources of information are consistently firm in stating that the offeror's performance was superior and that they would unhesitatingly do business with the offeror again. Complaints are negligible or unfounded. No doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government's requirements as stated in the RFQ.</p>
<p>+3 Good: Most sources of information state that the offeror's performance was good, better than average, etc., and that they would willingly do business with the offeror again. Complaints, though perhaps well-founded, are few and relatively minor. Little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government's requirements as stated in the RFQ.</p>
<p>+2 Neutral: Either no past performance history exists for the corporation, predecessor companies, key personnel, or major/critical subcontractors, or the offeror's record of past performance was neither predominantly favorable nor unfavorable. Sources of information are roughly divided over the quality of the offeror's performance. While some state that they would do business with the offeror again, others are doubtful or would not. Complaints are balanced by reports of good work. There is no performance record for the offeror.</p>
<p>+1 Marginal: Many sources of information made unfavorable reports about the offeror's performance and either express serious doubts about doing business with the offeror again or state that they would refuse to do so. However, there are some favorable reports, and some sources of information indicate that they would do business with the offeror again. There are many significant, serious, and well-founded complaints, but there are some reports of very good performance. Some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government's requirements as stated in the RFQ.</p>
<p>+0 Poor: A significant majority of sources of information are consistently firm in stating that the offeror's performance was entirely unsatisfactory and that they would not do business with the offeror again under any circumstances. Customer complaints are substantial or numerous and are well-founded. The offeror either has presented no persuasive evidence of having taken appropriate corrective action that will guard against such conduct in the foreseeable future, or it appears unlikely that the corrective action will be effective. Serious doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government requirements as stated in the RFQ.</p>
<p>f.) Any information collected concerning an offeror's past performance will be maintained in the official contract file.</p>
<p>g.) In accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p><br />B. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>C. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with its offer. All Offerors must be registered in CCR and have Annual Representations and Certifications complete on the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) as part of the proposal submission process. All prospective contractors submitting an offer in response to the subject solicitation must go to https://orca.bpn.gov/ in order to add or update its ORCA record.</p>
<p><strong>Site Visit:<br />A site visit will be held on April 28, 2008 @ 11:00 am and on April 29, 2008 @ 1:30 pm. Quoters shall contact the Project Officer (Ms. Kelli Mollison, 509-354-8013) to confirm attendance.</strong></p>
<p>Applicable Service Contract Act Wages (Jul 1999)</p>
<p>The attached Wage Determination, No. 2005-2565 (Rev 5.) dated 12/18/2007 specifies hourly rates of wages that shall be paid to all employees performing work required under this contract. These rates have been determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the provisions of the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended.</p>

<p>Security Clearance Requirements (Jul 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions.</p>
<p>"Employees" means both contractor and subcontractor employees unless otherwise noted:</p>
<p>The phrase "CDC owned or leased facilities" includes ATSDR, NIOSH/PRC/Pittsburgh, Pa.; NIOSH/Morgantown, W.V.; NIOSH/SRC/Spokane, Wa.; NIOSH/Cincinnati, Ohio; NCHS/Research Triangle Park, N.C.; NCHS/Hyattsville, Md. NCID/Fort Collins, Colorado; NCID/Anchorage, Alaska, and NCID/San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>(b) General</p>
<p>All contract employees who will be performing work under this contract on-site (i.e., in a CDC owned or leased facility) for a period exceeding 90 days in duration (45 days if employee is designated to work in Building 10, 15, or 17 at 1600 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA, or at CDC's Lawrenceville, GA facility) shall receive a favorable suitability determination prior to reporting to work at an on-site facility. Any contract employee(s) who cannot obtain a favorable suitability determination, will not be permitted to work at an on-site facility (see paragraph B below on temporary determinations.)</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for managing its workforce to ensure that sufficient contract employees who meet all suitability requirements are available to perform the duties required under the contract. New or replacement contract employees must have previously received a favorable suitability determination in sufficient time to perform work at an on-site facility under the contract. If it has been over one (1) year since a contract employee has worked in a position on a Federal contract for which a security clearance was required, a new National Agency Check and Inquiry (NACI) must be obtained.</p>
<p>(c) Temporary Determinations/Clearances</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may, as appropriate, authorize and grant temporary suitability determinations to contract employees. However, the granting of a temporary determination shall not be considered as assurance that full clearance will follow. The granting of a temporary determination shall not prevent, preclude or bar the withdrawal or termination of any temporary determination. Prior to the Government's issuance of a temporary determination, the Contractor shall obtain and provide to the Contracting Officer a state-wide criminal records check for all on-site contract employees. The Contractor shall also obtain and provide to the Contracting Officer a state-wide motor vehicle violations check for any contract employee required to operate a motor vehicle as part of their duties under the contract at an on-site facility. All criminal record checks and motor vehicle violation checks shall cover a twelve (12) month period beginning twelve (12) months prior to the date of the contract award. Criminal record checks and motor vehicle violation checks may be obtained through local state, county or city law enforcement agencies at contract employee's place of residence. Where state-wide criminal record and motor vehicle violation systems are not available, county-wide or city-wide checks may be substituted. All substitutions shall be certified by the law enforcement agency that a state-wide criminal record system is not available.</p>
<p>(d) Required Information for NACI Clearance:</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, the Contractor shall submit the completed forms specified below to the appropriate office as directed by the Contracting Officer not later then 5 calendar days from the effective date of the contract. Items (1) through (6) must be completed by contract employees who require access to on-site facilities in the performance of the contract. Additionally, the contractor shall furnish, on a monthly basis, item (7) (if the information requested in Item (7) is provided as part of the Contractor's standard invoice, no additional submission is required). The Government will furnish the necessary forms to the Contractor.</p>
<p>(1) two (2) completed Forms FD-258, "FBI Fingerprint Charts"***</p>
<p>(2) one (1) completed Standard Form 85, "Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions"</p>
<p>(3) one (1) completed "Declaration for Enrollment"</p>
<p>(4) one (1) resume or curriculum vitae or completed job application form</p>
<p>(5) one (1) copy of the state-wide criminal records check</p>
<p>(6) one (1) copy of the motor vehicle violations check (when applicable)</p>
<p>(7) a complete listing of all current Contractor and Subcontractor on-site employees by name, work location and employer.</p>
<p>*** The CDC, Human Resource Management Offices (HRMO) have the necessary equipment to complete fingerprint charts (FD-258). The Contractor may contact the Contracting Officer for arrangements regarding utilization of the HRMO fingerprinting equipment. The fingerprint charts may also be completed through a local state, county or city law enforcement agency at the employee's place of residence.</p>
<p>Using the required information specified above, a National Agency Check and Inquiry (NACI) will be processed by the CDC through the Office of Personnel Management and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (OPM/FBI) on each contract employee who will be performing duties on-site.</p>
<p>(d) Removal of Contractor Employees</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor to immediately remove any contract employee from the on-site facility who has failed to receive a suitability determination and whose continued employment is deemed contrary to the public interest, inconsistent with the best interests of security, or is identified as a potential threat to the health, safety, security, general well being or operational mission of the on-site facility and its population. The Contracting Officer may also request the Contractor to immediately remove any contract employee from the on-site facility should it be determined that the individuals are being assigned to duty who have been disqualified for suitability reasons, or who are found to be unfit for performing duties during their tour(s) of duty. Contract employees who are requested to be removed from the on-site facility are required to leave the work site immediately.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will make all determinations regarding the removal of any contract employee from the on-site facility, except under certain conditions. When a Contracting Officer is not available, either during the day or after normal business hours, or in situations where a delay would not be in the best interest of the Government, or a potential threat to the health, safety, security, general well being or operational mission of the facility and its population, the Project Officer will have the authority to direct immediate removal of the contractor employee from the on-site facility. The Contracting Officer shall subsequently provide the official notification to the Contractor for removal of a contract employee from the CDC facility. When removal is directed due to a nonsuitability determination as a result of the NACI, no further information will be provided. If removal is directed for other reasons relating to specific conduct of the employee during performance of the work, the Contracting Officer's official notification will provide information as to these reasons.</p>
<p>(e) Identification Badges/Cardkey Access: <br /><br />(1) Identification Badges:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall require each contract employee who has been authorized unescorted access to an on-site facility, either through the temporary clearance process or the formal NACI process, to display an identification badge as required and furnished by the CDC. The Contractor shall submit to the Project Officer a completed Identification Badge Request Form (CDC Form 0.1137) for each contract employee who has been authorized unescorted access to an on-site facility. Contact the Project Officer for details on additional procedures, specific addresses and hours of business for issuance of Identification Badges for all other CDC locations.</p>
<p>(2) Cardkey Access:</p>
<p>Unescorted access to certain on-site facilities at CDC may only be gained through the use of a Cardkey. If a contract employee has been determined to need regular unescorted access to one of the Cardkey access designated areas, a Cardkey Request Form (CDC Form 0.834) must be completed and submitted to the Project Officer for written approval. Contact the Project Officer for details of procedures and specific addresses and hours of business for issuance of Cardkey Access.</p>
<p>(3) Return of Identification Badges/Cardkeys</p>
<p>The Contractor shall arrange for the return of any employee identification badges and/or cardkeys immediately upon their separation of the duties at the on-site facility. Contact the Project Officer for location of the depositories for the return of badges. Cardkeys shall be returned to the appropriate Physical Security Activity Office.</p>
<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p>Minimum Required Insurance (Jul 1999)</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.228-5, Insurance, Work on a Government Installation, incorporated by reference, the Contractor shall furnish a certificate of insurance of the following types and minimum amounts which shall be obtained and maintained during the entire period of performance of this contract:</p>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of a Cisco 2960 Switch, Cisco 2851 Router, Cisco Catalyst 3560G, and Cisco GBIC modules, which will form a switch and router solution for IV&V. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The Cisco Catalyst 2960 24 port switch is a fixed-configuration switch that provides wire-speed Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet connectivity for small and medium-sized networks. The switch provides 24 10/100-Mbps ports for edge connectivity, enhanced security, high availability, and advanced quality of service. The Bureaus Systems Engineering Task Team was tasked with evaluating the Cisco Catalyst 2960 24 port switch. Systems Engineering determined that the product fulfilled the following requirements:  The switch must provide wire speeds of 10/100 GB.  The switch must provide reliable connectivity between the eDV Web servers and database servers.  The switch must be able to provide port density for the domain controllers and monitoring servers. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system<BR><BR>The current CISCO switches and router has not previously had any problems; however, the aging switches have been in service for about 6-7 years now and have not been replaced. Hardware may start failing soon and it is in CAs best interest to be ready to replace the Cisco switches with new switches right away. It could take days to replace a CISCO component, which could potentially mean unnecessary downtime. The main reason for the equipment; however, is to expand the network. With the amount of systems that CA has, CA is rapidly running out of ports on the network and is preparing for future needs. Cisco Systems is a leading network appliance manufacturer and has a proven industry record for robustness, reliability, and functionality. Cisco appliances have been implemented in private and government sectors, including DOD and intelligence agencies. Cisco Systems has comprehensive and rigid testing criteria for their certified engineers. They have continually increased the number of qualified engineers who support their products worldwide. The Cisco Catalyst 2960 24 port switch has been, and continues to be, a key component in many network architecture implementations and deployments. This is due to the success of the Cisco Catalyst 2960 24 port switch in providing network performance, reliability, expandability, functionality, connectivity, and security, as well as minimizing the vulnerability of network systems in Internet, intranet, and extranet solutions. The Cisco equipment was selected for this purpose because results obtained by the Bureaus Systems Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of States throughput, processing and redundancy requirements. It has been approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline. The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

D1.2  Mission

The mission of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is to administer the provisions of the Highway Safety Act of 1966 and to save lives, prevent injuries and reduce economic costs due to road traffic crashes, through education, research, safety standards and enforcement activity.

D1.3  Background

D1.3.1	  NHTSA makes extensive use of the proprietary finite element solver (LS-Dyna3d) for analysis in multiple vehicle and biomechanics safety research programs.  This program is used to analyzed vehicle to vehicle crashes and to aid in the design and analysis of test conditions.  LS-Dyna3d is also used extensively to study injury mechanisms and to predict the likelihood of head injury from dummy head acceleration measurements.  This COTS software is licensed from the Livermore Software Technology Corporation (LSTC) and is commonly used by automotive manufacturers and suppliers worldwide.  LSTCs LS-Dyna3d solver is also heavily utilized by Volpe staff in conducting train crashworthiness studies for the FRA.  NHTSA will lease 35 licenses for LS-Dyna3d or Equal Software through an RFP for a Base period of 1 year and four (4)1-year renewal option periods.

D2.0  REQUIREMENTS:   Lease of 35 LS-Dyna3d or Equal Software Licenses.

Requirements for crash simulation software (listed in descending order of importance)

D2.1  Demonstrate Capability for Automotive Crash Simulation  Offerors should submit demonstrate experience and capability for the software capability for conduction finite element simulation of vehicle to vehicle crash simulations.  This should include the simulation of occupant restraints including seat belts, airbags, and side curtain air bags.  Simulation support for biomechanical tissues is also important.

D2.2  Compatibility with Existing NHTSA Vehicle Datasets  NHTSA, in conjunction with FHWA, has developed a fleet of crash vehicle models that are available from George Washington University (http://www.ncac.gwu.edu/vml/models.html)  The ability to run these existing models is critical for NHTSA researchers.  Offerors should discuss the ability to run these models and to discuss any conversion effort that would be required if they are not able to run existing crash models.

D2.3  Compatibility with Existing NHTSA Biomechanical datasets  NHTSA has developed several biomechanical models, such as SIMON finite element head model and THOR dummy model. The offeror should discuss compatibility with these models. Models are available from (http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/portal/site/nhtsa/menuitem.ac7b3be46ee8bfd24ec86e10dba046a0/)

D2.4  Availability of commercial dummy datasets  The availability of commercial crash dummy models for the proposed analysis code significantly improves NHTSAs capability to utilize the software.  The major suppliers or anthropomorphic test dummies, FTSS, Denton, ect., have commercial efforts in place to lease validated models.  Offerors should discuss the availability of commercial crash dummy models and the use with the analysis codes.

<p>Interested parties shall submit prices as follows:</p>
<p>CLIN 0001 - 25 sheets of semi-rigid PVC foam as specified Delivery Date: May 28, 2008<br />CLIN 0002 - 25 additional sheets at Government option to buy Delivery Date: February 28, 2009</p>

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Anticipated award date is no later than 01 May 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 30 April 2008.  PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION.  Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Tracey Burgess at 252-335-6790.  Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the nomenclature; part number; unit price and extended price, FOB point; payment terms and any discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate I.

<DESC><p>Questions/Answers</p>
<p>1.) Question - After reviewing the PWS I found that Appendixes A&amp;B are missing and there was no pricing document-was this intentional? If not can you please post or forward a copy to my attention?</p>

<p>Sample Quote Set-up:</p>
<p>Base Year - Total&nbsp;sq ft to be cleaned 95K sq ft @&nbsp;__ per sq ft =&nbsp;__ per cleaning session X 2 cleanings per year = __ Annually</p>

<DESC>Background

The United States Department of Agriculture - Center for Plant Health Science & Technology (CPHST), is the scientific support agency of the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine division.  Plant Protection and Quarantine is responsible for safeguarding American agriculture from exotic pests and diseases and to provide response to incursions by eradication or containment.

The high consequence exotic Citrus Greening pathogen, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, was discovered in Florida 2005 and is now established throughout the major citrus growing regions of the state.  Through the Citrus Health Response Plan, CPHST leads the effort to limit spread of this pathogen within Florida and to other citrus growing states where the pathogen is not present.

There is no known source of viable resistance in Citrus species to Citrus Greening, and pesticides to the pathogen or to its psyllid vector is not effective in disease prevention.   Citrus growing regions that have high prevalence of Citrus Greening become unproductive after a few years and this is anticipated to occur in Florida as disease prevalence increases.  The future viability of the Florida citrus industry is dependent on finding a suitable means of production in the presence of the Citrus Greening Pathogen.  It is imperative that a durable means of growing citrus that remains productive long enough for sustainable harvest be found.  At this time, the development of resistant citrus germplasm through genetic engineering provides the most likely means of achieving this goal.

Objective

<DESC><p>A. General Information</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="color: #000000;">This is a reposting of this announcement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Vendors that have responded to the previous posting dated March 11, 2008 don't have to resubmit their original response unless there is an update or change to it.</span></strong></p>
<p>The Southwest Region will be standardizing Incontinences Supplies - Disposable Adult, Pediatric, Neonatal Diapers, Briefs, &amp; Peripads. The Region recognizes this is a category in which vendors may manufacture and/or distribute subsets of the category. A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. In order to meet the total requirements of the Region a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items within a product category) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs? needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. The product category includes disposable diapers for adult, pediatric and/or neonatal patient, mesh briefs, and peripads for adults. The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit?s (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory. The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB. This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at: https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is Jul 2008. The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability. Point of Contact: Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN at (619) 532-8517; Email- cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil B. Products &amp; Performance Required The Southwest Region is seeking product line items in the category of Incontinences Supplies - Disposable Adult, Pediatric, Neonatal Diapers, Briefs, &amp; Peripads. The product category includes disposable diapers for adult, pediatric and/or neonatal patients and mesh briefs and peripads for adults. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $72K ($34K for Pediatric &amp; $38K for Adult). This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. This amount is only based on prime vendor sales. Purchase card transactions and direct procurement by the end-users are not reflected in this estimate so actual volume may increase for some categories. At the request of the Southwest Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C. Instructions to Vendors If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address, your answers to the technical questions/criteria below and product literature to cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil no later than&nbsp;May 7, 2008. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice. Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified. If your product literature is more than 4MB in size, please mail your product literature to: Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN Tri-Service Regional Business Office MSMMO - Southwest Region 34800 Bob Wilson Drive, Suite 110 San Diego, CA 92134 Phone: (619) 532-8517 This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer. We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission. D. Evaluation Criteria The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within the Southwest Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative. Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate: (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor?s information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. Technical/Company Criteria 1. Vendors must provide Incontinence Supplies - Disposable Adult, Pediatric or Neonatal Diapers (disposable diapers) for adult like Brief Stretch X-Large Tactics, Pant Medium 90 ? 100 Lbs, pediatric and/or neonatal patients like Diaper Pampers Premature, Diaper Pampers Newborn and/or Briefs &amp; Peripads (mesh briefs and peripads) for adults. A complete line of product' is defines as the MTF's requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical-Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. 2. Vendors must provide a list of the products they supply in this product line and the brand name to include the type, size and type of fastener. 3. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the Prime Vendor supporting our Region, Cardinal Health or will be disqualified. 4. Vendors must have a DAPA number or is in the process of obtaining a DAPA or will be disqualified. 5. Your product line must be latex free and this must be indicated on the packaging of the product. 6. Your products must be hypoallergenic and low lint and this must be indicated on the packaging of the product. 7. Your products must be flame retardant as required by federal law. 8. Your products must pull moisture away from the body. 9. Your products must be absorbent enough to prevent leakage of fluids and solids for overnight use. 10. Your products must be strong enough to resist tearing for overnight use. 11. Your products must have a moisture-proof, soft backing that protects clothes and bedding. 12. Your diapers and briefs must allow for free movement and prevent skin damage at the waist and leg openings. List the type of waist and leg opening. 13. Your diapers and briefs must have adjustable and reusable fasteners. 14. Your products must be biodegradable and indicated in your product literature as such. 15. Your packaging must make it easy for the user to identify the type and size of the product. 16. Vendors must provide product literature for this product line. 17. Vendors must provide 24/7 customer support and identify company resources for such support with their initial submittals. 18. Vendors must submit prices lower than their DAPA or will be disqualified. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA. 19. Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic excel format upon request. 20. Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls/alerts that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for central venous catheters and supplies including dates, duration, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals. This represents your sole opportunity to present this information. Provide any mitigating factors that you may have in order to provide a proper context for the cited back orders, recalls, etc. Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples. Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Not Acceptable, 2 = Minimally Acceptable, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Acceptable, and 5 = Highly Acceptable. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the ?break?, in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization. A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability. Clinical/Performance Criteria 1. The product pulls moisture away from the body to prevent skin breakdown. 2. The moisture-proof backing is soft and protects clothes and bedding from being soiled 3. The product does not tear easily during overnight use to ensure it protects clothes and bedding from being soiled. 4. The product has leakage protection of fluids and solids during overnight use to protect clothing and bedding from being soiled. 5. The product doesn?t gap at the leg or waist to keep fluids and solids contained in the diaper or pad. 6. The product stays secured in place. 7. The product stays intact when wet and with movement to ensure clothing and bedding are protected from soiling. 8. The product allows free movement and prevents skin damage at the waist and leg openings. 9. The fasteners on the product are adjustable and reusable to allow for different body contours and prevent waste. 10. The patient?s skin integrity is maintained. Phase III ? Pricing Analysis Process. All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region. Failure to respond within the timeframe will result in disqualification. The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor. Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements. Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.</p>

These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Cisco authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Cisco warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of a Cisco 2960 Switch, Cisco 2851 Router, Cisco Catalyst 3560G, and Cisco GBIC modules, which will form a switch and router solution for IV&V.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The Cisco Catalyst 2960 24 port switch is a fixed-configuration switch that provides wire-speed Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet connectivity for small and medium-sized networks. The switch provides 24 10/100-Mbps ports for edge connectivity, enhanced security, high availability, and advanced quality of service.
The Bureaus Systems Engineering Task Team was tasked with evaluating the Cisco Catalyst 2960 24 port switch.  Systems Engineering determined that the product fulfilled the following requirements:
	The switch must provide wire speeds of 10/100 GB.	The switch must provide reliable connectivity between the eDV Web servers and database servers.	The switch must be able to provide port density for the domain controllers and monitoring servers.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.<BR><BR>The current CISCO switches and router has not previously had any problems; however, the aging switches have been in service for about 6-7 years now and have not been replaced.  Hardware may start failing soon and it is in CAs best interest to be ready to replace the Cisco switches with new switches right away. It could take days to replace a CISCO component, which could potentially mean unnecessary downtime.  The main reason for the equipment; however, is to expand the network. With the amount of systems that CA has, CA is rapidly running out of ports on the network and is preparing for future needs. 
Cisco Systems is a leading network appliance manufacturer and has a proven industry record for robustness, reliability, and functionality. Cisco appliances have been implemented in private and government sectors, including DOD and intelligence agencies. Cisco Systems has comprehensive and rigid testing criteria for their certified engineers. They have continually increased the number of qualified engineers who support their products worldwide. The Cisco Catalyst 2960 24 port switch has been, and continues to be, a key component in many network architecture implementations and deployments. This is due to the success of the Cisco Catalyst 2960 24 port switch in providing network performance, reliability, expandability, functionality, connectivity, and security, as well as minimizing the vulnerability of network systems in Internet, intranet, and extranet solutions.
The Cisco equipment was selected for this purpose because results obtained by the Bureaus Systems Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of States throughput, processing and redundancy requirements. It has been approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>FAA to Host Annual National Small Business Procurement Opportunities Training Conference and Trade Show in Las Vegas, Nevada:

REGISTRATION FEES WILL INCREASE ON APRIL 18TH.  EARLY HOTEL REGISTRATION IS ENCOURAGED TO OBTAIN THE LIMITED CONFERENCE GROUP RATE OF $93/NIGHT. 
VIEW THE UPDATED CONFERENCE AGENDA HIGHLIGHTS BELOW.
The Annual FAA National Small Business Procurement Opportunities Training Conference and Trade Show will be hosted, June 16-19, 2008, at The Riviera Hotel Convention Center located at 2901 Las Vegas Blvd., South, Las Vegas, NV  89109.  The forum will provide small businesses knowledge on how to contract with the FAA, marketing strategies, and give current information on FAA procurement opportunities (such as construction, information technology support services, management services, technical support services, engineering services, facilities support services, environmental services, telecommunications services, major system and subsystem manufacturing, security guard services, architectural and training services etc.)
The FAA annually obligates more than $3 billion in goods and services (over $1 billion a year in support services awarded to small businesses.)  In Fiscal Year 2007, the FAA awarded 31% of the total procurement dollars to small businesses, 7% to 8(a) certified firms, 11% to small disadvantaged businesses, 5% to women-owned businesses and 1% to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  
The FAA continues to aggressively reach out to the nation's small businesses  by conducting technical panel sessions and procurement opportunity workshops that are specifically focused on awarding contracts and subcontracts to small businesses.

<DESC>On December 10, 2007, a pre-solicitation notice and vendor survey were issued for solicitation 6FLS-A5-080382-N.  After further market research was conducted, the acquisition strategy changed to the use of GSA Federal Supply Schedules (FAR 8.4).  In addition, the use of a blanket purchase agreement will best suit the government's needs. Therefore,  6FLS-A5-080382-N is cancelled.  A request for quote for the requirements will be posted to E-buy on or about May 16, 2008.  This will have a new solicitation number.

Joan F. VanMiddlesworth, Contracting Officer, opened the meeting on both dates by introducing the VA staff in attendance, passing out the sign-in sheet for the contractors' completion.  She also stated that all technical questions must be presented in writing on the index cards distributed.  Questions and answers will be recorded on FedBizOpps by end of week April 11, 2008 if possible.2.  The request for proposal solicitation number is VA-245-08-RP-0055.  It is a Construction Project titled 4 Story Pre-Engineered (Modular) Admin Building at VAMC, Washington, DC.  The building is approximately 40,700 SF.  The project is a total set-aside for service-disabled veteran owned small business.  3.  Bids are due on 5/8/08 no later than 3:00 PM local timeat the Martinsburg facility in Building 308B.  Late bids will not be accepted.  4.  The package requires a bid bond in the amount of 20% or a maximum of $3,000,000.00.  If a bid bond does not accompany the bid package on 5/8/08 it will be considered nonresponsive.5.  Bids will only be accepted from Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small businesses.  To be considered as Service-Disabled Veteran Owned you must be registered with VetBiz.gov (through the VA OSDBU site) and CCR.gov.  Failure to register may be grounds for rejection of the bid.6.  This is a construction project so all the terms, conditions and clauses of a construction project apply; such as Buy American Act applicable to purchase of supplies and Davis-Bacon wages that must be paid to anyone working on this project.  Even though this is a modular design it still applies as well as all the Labor Standards.4.  Photography:  Must be approved by Contracting Officer.5.  Site visit was made at end of meeting.QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FROM 4/8/08 SITE VISIT1.a.	Is there a soil's report?  No we don't have one - only recommendation is to presume the existing soil conditions will meet the requirements of the building.1.b.	Is this project funded?  Yes pending approval of the final pricing it will be funded.  There is no money on station at this time; however, once the project is ready for award it will be funded.2.a.	Reference Pg 13 of 120 D1.B.3 (Design Review) states DB has 10 working days but on page 6 of 120, the duration is in calendar days.  Should Page 13 of 120 read 10 calendar days?   All times in contracting are calendar days - we will check this and fix it.  We will put out a correction on the number of days.  SEE AMENDMENT No. 1.2.b.	If not, will days then be added to page 6/120 for DB schedule or construction schedule?No the completion time for the project is 365 days.  SEE AMENDMENT No. 1.   which amended to 375 calendar days (147calendar days for design and 228 calendar days for construction).3.	Elevators:  You indicate only one elevator.  Based on number of people why only 1 elevator?   That 1 elevator is an internal convenience elevator and has nothing to do with code or load demand.  The point of this building is that it will be connected at all levels to the main medical center so there will be other points of access over to the 4 story.  4.	Background checks:  What is the cost if Government does the checks to be reimbursed?	We do local fingerprints here at no cost to you for every employee having access to the building including truck drivers.  If something flags up on a particular employee we will advise you.  We expect you to have some idea of your employees before you bring them on as we have actually escorted employees from the site.  We are not going to do full blown investigations.5.a.	What exterior finish is required?  This is an amendment we will have to issue because what we would like is basically two line items.  Initially EIFS was the exterior choice of the building.  However, we would like to know what a line item cost (ADD ALTERNATE) is to match the white brick you see on the main hospital.  The base bid is for EFIS.   See Amendment No. 1.5.b.	What type of roof?  Flat roof system5c.	Is wood construction acceptable?  Yes but you still need to meet all other life safety requirements.6.	Will building take away current parking spaces?  Yes but that is already planned.7.	Does the Prime Contractor (SDVOSB) have to have the construction bond themselves or can a team partner (General Contractor) carry the bond?  In teaming the prime must have the bond.SEE IL 049-06-4  Joint Venture and Teaming Arrangements for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.  http://www1.va.gov/oamm/oa/ars/policyreg/ils/index.cfm8.	Please clarify your meaning of modular construction?   We have a very tight site, we have a lot of projects that are going to occur this year and next.  As a result, we cannot afford to lose parking space.  The reason we opted for modular is because (1) many of the components can be fabricated off site and installed safely minimizing staging and (2) cost reasons.  We are not looking at on-site standard construction, we are looking at prefabricated components, panels, etc. that are then shipped to the site and installed with limited on-site modification and connections.  But as far as materials, it can be from wood to any other component.9.	Is the pedestrian walkway intended to be modular?  It can be but doesn't have to be.  In fact in light of the last question we probably prefer it to be modularly constructed.  It's basically a four story corridor.10.	Must Joint Venture (JV) proposals be approved before bid due date?   Not to my knowledge they don't have to be.  I'm just telling you that if you want to be sure, we are not going to be waiting around for corrections to it.  If you want to go ahead and get it in and get it approved now that's my offer to you.  SEE IL 049-06-4.  (above)11.	How much lay down area is available?	I can't give you square footage all I can say is there is very little.  12.	Is weekend work permitted?   Yes.  All off hours work we need prior notification so we can alert the Police Department.13.	Can we request monies if we bond a storage facility to expedite payment to subcontractors/vendors?	See VAAR clause noted in #18 Q&A of 4/9/08 below.14.	Will there be preference to small disabled veteran contract if picked up by larger company to accomplish bonding requirements?IL 049-06-4, referenced above, clearly requires both parties to be small business.  15.	Are as built drawings available for location where building is going?	Right now we have CDs available.  It is a combination of CADD files that shows site plan, the typical hospital floor plans so you have a sense of connection to the building, and then scanned as-built files of the main hospital building that was built in the 1950's.QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FROM 4/9/08 SITE VISIT1.  	Will the loading dock be active during our construction period?   The main hospital loading dock will remain open during construction.  The kitchen will use that loading dock for the duration of the construction.2.  	Are the existing trailers to be demolished, turned over to the VA?   They should be demoed and removed at the Contractor's expense.3.  	Although the new facility is being built on Government property, will there need to be:    	(a)  a review from the National Capitol Park and Planning Commission - No    	(b)  a historical review from the State Historical Preservation Office      - No    	(c)  an environmental study and assessment - No4.  	Are there any LEED requirements associated with the construction/fabrication of this facility?  No5.  	What are the reimbursable fees payable to the VA Medical Center for the badging of construction site employees and subcontractors?  There are no fees charged by the VA for the badging services.  There is a $5 or $10 replacement fee if a badge needs to be replaced.  The fingerprinting is an expense to the VA not to the contractor.6.  	What utility services are available within the Main Hospital to utilize to feed the new 4-story modular building?   Electric, tel/com, sprinkler and sanitary are available within the Main hospital building.  It is recommended that water be connected to the main hospital loop.Will we be required to secure services from PEPCO to provide the required power needed for this new facility?  No7.	What permits, if any will we be required to secure from the City of Washington, since the construction of this new facility is being built on Federal Property?   With regard to construction permits none required.  No permitting required for environmental study.8.	What are the requirements for physical security and is there a requirement for 100% standby power?    Physical security - does that question mean does the contract have to provide a perimeter  fence?  "Fence, the windows".  This modular building will not need blast protection requirements nor will the contractor have to provide a perimeter fence.  However, during construction if there is the need for a construction fence that is a separate issue.  But no, this is not a compound building that needs its own internal security.	The question about the 100% standby power once we resolve the answer that regards the electrical feed, again from the shops, where it will be tied into, obviously a portion of it will be tied into emergency power but will all of the building need to be on standby power?   No.  All building will not need to be on standby power.  There will be connection to emergency power for items relating to life-safety.9.	Are we responsible for the site-limits at the construction site area?What is our latitude with the utilization of the existing loading docks and smoking areas for staging of our construction equipment and construction site services?	As far as the existing main loading dock going back to receiving area will remainoperational.  We have a main loading dock but there is also another loading dock adjacent to the forward that feeds the kitchen area.  But the main hospital loading dock will remain operational during the life of this construction.  The smoking area can be used as a lay-down area, as we will move this westward for the duration of the project.10.	Can we submit our Design Build Drawings in phases?  Design submittals are approved at 30%, 60%, 95% and 100%.Or will there be a requirement for 100% completed drawings for all Divisions prior to any construction commencing?   YesWould you give consideration to demo work and utility relocation?  No we can't give consideration. 11.	The specifications call for (4) copies of the Optional Form 308 with a bid guarantee to be submitted on Bid Day.  How many copies of the Technical Proposals do you require?  The requirement is to submit Standard Form (SF) 1442 in original.  There is no limit to the number of pages at this time that you can put into the technical proposal.  No OF308 is needed.   SEE Amendment No. 1 for submission requirements.12.  	Will the main loading dock be active during construction? Yes.13.  	Has Geo tech work been done already?   No, we don't have any soil surveys or test borings for the area.  For the purpose of the bid you have to presume that the soil meets adequate soil compression requirements.  You will have to proceed with that until actual work starts.  Once contract is awarded and the borings are done, we will proceed from there.  There has been construction done in that area in the past 2 decades but we have been unable to locate any soil reports.  For the purpose of the project we will have to presume the soil condition meets, there is nothing unusual.  Joan:  Unforeseen condition, there is a clause in the contract to cover that.14.  	Is this DC Tax Exempt?   Construction projects are not tax exempt.  Products that we buy for taking care of our patients are tax exempt.  Reference 52.229-3 FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL TAXES  (APR 2003) (Clause Incorporated by Reference) on Page 50.15.  	Please clarify A/E contracted with Prime if DB Prime is not JV?  Amendment No. 1 redefines the members of the DB team and their association to the Prime Contractor of Joint Venture.  SEE IL 049-06-4 (above).	16.  	Utility Tie-In points for water/sewer/power/datacom raceways in existing building?  Is the question where are the points of connection or if it is all being connected to the main Building?As far as the building itself, the intent is for HVAC to be package units for the building.  There is a water loop around the hospital and tie-in for water will be at that loop that goes around the perimeter of the facility.  But electrical will be fed from within the main hospital as will telecommunication.  What we should probably do is clarify and highlight on a site plan the distances where those connections are.  SEE ADDED PAGE 121 to AMENDMENT No. 1.17.  	Are there modular buildings on-site now?  No.18.  	Payment terms for stored material (off-site).  See Page 42 paragraph d(1) through (6)  of 4.19  VAAR 852.236-82  PAYMENTS UNDER FIXED-PRICE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS (WITHOUT NAS)  (APR 1984). 19.  	Which form is the Optional Form 308?  Title is Solicitation and Offer - Negotiated Acquisition - SEE Replacement Pages which delete any reference to this form.20.  	This four story building is going to be designed for Seismic IBL-2003 & 90 MPH wind?  If it is addressed in Seismic IBC-2006 then that is the criteria.21.  	Any schematics for building elevation?  No 22.  	Water connection:       	a.  Does VA require separate meter for this building?  No       	b.  Is water loop private (Gov't owned) or Public (WASA owned)? Private (Gov't owned - internal tie-ins)23.  Is there any protection or preservation requirement for trees?  No.NOTE:  IL 049-06-4  Joint Venture and Teaming Arrangements for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business can be found at http://www1.va.gov/oamm/oa/ars/policyreg/ils/index.cfmOTHER QUESTIONS ASKED VIA E-MAIL1.a.	Should the fire alarm system for the new building be connected to the existing building or should it have its own fire alarm panel?  Yes the fire alarm system should be connected to the existing building.    b.	If it is to be connected to the existing building's panel, is there space for additional zoning?  Yes there is space for additional zoning.    c.	Should the sprinkler system connect to the existing building?  Yes    d.	The main building has either a fire pump or is directly connected to the city water, if it has a fire pump the new building will not have enough room for a fire pump.            The main building does have a fire pump but it is unclear why the new building would not have enough room for a local pump to accommodate its needs.    e.	On the space program chart the square footage for the corridor, stairs and bridge corridor by just adding a 20% conversion factor.  This factor doesn't account for all stairs, corridor and bridge square footage meaning the total square footage will be much greater than 40,704 SF.  The total square footage of the building may not exceed 40,000 SF.  A reduction in programme square footage will be acceptable to accommodate necessary circulation, means of egress, etc.2.	Can you advise if any glass coatings or tinting will be needed on this project?  No glass coating or tinting will be required.3.	The RFP indicates Offeror is responsible for demolition, but does not indicate what to demolish.  During yesterday's Site Visit, Mr. Sami indicated the removal of the existing trailers was required.  Con you please confirm this and any other demolition that is required under this RFP?  Trailers 7 and 8 are to be included as part of the demolition as well as any of the existing curbs and sidewalks.4.	Please confirm if the finish floor of the new modular office building must match the finish floor of the existing building or can ramps/sloped walkways be used?  Yes, the finish floor elevations of all floors of the new modular building must match the finish floor elevations of Building 1.  The corridor connection between both structures can not be a sloped ramp.5.	Page 11 of 120, paragraph 1.(6), indicates the RFP is to show where Offeror can have use of site for storage/parking.  None is indicated.  Please clarify.  At the present time storage and parking is limited to the project area as long as access to the main receiving dock is maintained.  There is "street" metered parking available along first street south of the medical center campus.6.	Is Progressive Collapse Design in accordance with UFC Requirements required by this RFP?  No7.	Offeror is required to design a 4 Story Hallway from the new modular building to the existing building.  We were given as built drawings of the existing building.  The second and third floor drawings show patient rooms on the wall where the hallway is to connect.  Is there any restrictions as to which room we design the hallway to pass through?  The design decisions will be reviewed and coordinated by the VAMC.  In other words, that would not be a decision that the team would have to make, but a VA direction.8.	Do you anticipate joint ventures with this opportunity?  I would like to know if you have any guidelines or limitations for an SDVOSB joint venture with a non SDVOSB partner.  SEE IL 049-06-4 (above).

<DESC>CBD Notice posted on February 25, 2008, amended on March 17, 2008, March 25,2008, 
March 31, 2008 and on April 9, 2008.   This amendment changes the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) issuance date from on or about April 16, 2008 to on or about April 23, 2008.

Please reference this number when requesting procurement documents, drawings and or questions regarding the solicitation.

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for public architecture, engineering, and construction through a Design-Build / Bridging delivery method.      

GSA intends to award one (1) firm-fixed price Design-Build contract for all design and construction services necessary for Site Utility Upgrades  13.8kV Primary Electrical Distribution System located at the Nebraska Avenue Complex, 3801 Nebraska Avenue, NW,  Washington, DC, Procurement Request Number WPJ-08-0289.  The Site Utility Upgrades  13.8kV Primary Electrical Distribution System is a renovation of an electrical system on an occupied facility.   

Construction completion and final acceptance is expected to occur on or before December 29, 2010.  The anticipated cost for the project is between $20,000,000 and $30,000,000, and will consist of a renovation of an electrical system on an occupied facility.  

The proposed site covers approximately 25 acres, bounded by Nebraska Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, Rock Creek, and private property.   The scope of the project is to provide a three feeder spot network electrical system including utility metering switchgear, underground distribution, underground vaults and connections to the existing buildings. Critical programmatic requirements include the need to keep the existing buildings in operation until the new system is complete.  

The design-build scope of work includes all engineering, civil, architectural /structural, design, construction, and other related services necessary to design and to construct the electrical distribution system.  Related services include, but are not limited to, geotechnical evaluation and monitoring, archaeological monitoring, permitting, testing and inspection during construction, commissioning and potential additional geotechnical analysis of the site.  Preliminary approvals have been secured from National Capital Planning Commission for the current design. Additional submissions will be required to secure final approvals.

This project requires the construction of a new primary electrical system including underground utility metering vault, duct banks, underground network transformer vaults, connection to existing electrical systems and removal of the existing electrical system, including salvage of designated equipment at the Nebraska Avenue Complex, together with associated mechanical, electrical and general construction work. Work includes selective demolition of existing electrical system and storm water system, and provision of underground electrical substation vaults, electrical distribution system, spot network substations, including transformers and switchgear, medium voltage metering switchgear and cabling, PEPCO connections, switchboards, connections to existing electrical system, temporary wiring, excavation and backfill and surface restoration and incidental related work. The Contractor shall provide the services of Registered Professional Engineers and Architects, experienced in the type of work contemplated, to provide design, calculations, field survey, drawings and specifications covering the work. Disciplines anticipated include electrical engineering, structural engineering, civil engineering, architecture, and horticulture.

The Contractor shall provide all the necessary labor, materials, supervision, management, quality control plan and testing to produce a finished and operational electrical system conforming to the contract documents.

The completed project will meet or exceed all Federal design and construction statutes, standards, and regulations, including but not limited to the energy goals stated in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards, and Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection measures.  

Interested Offerors must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, which has successfully and satisfactorily completed projects of similar complexity, scope, and size; or, which has similar projects currently in construction.

The design of the engineering and architectural features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by engineers and architects registered to practice in their particular field within the District of Columbia.  The architect-engineer portion of this design-build entity must be a firm or joint venture having an existing active office located within the Washington, DC metropolitan area.  This existing active office will have the responsibility for providing the architectural and engineering services.

Offerors, individually or as a team, must have the capacity to obtain performance and payment bonding for up to 100% of the firm-fixed-price Design-Build Contract.

While the contractors personnel will have to satisfy the requirements of Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12, the Government does not anticipate that any special security clearance (i.e., TOP SECRET) will be required to participate in this procurement.  

GSA intends to award a firm-fixed-price design-build contract pursuant to the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 36.3 and Subpart 15.  The procurement will be completed in two phases: Phase 1 will be a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) and Phase 2 will be a Request for Proposals (RFP).  During Phase 1, Offerors will prepare and submit their qualifications as specified in the RFQ package which will be issued on or about March 17, 2008, on the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  

The evaluation factors for Phase 1 are as follows:  1) Past Performance, 2) Technical Approach, 3) Specialized Experience and Technical Competency, and 4) Capability to Perform.  Refer to the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) package for details on the Phase 1 evaluation criteria and information for submittals.  On or about early May 2008, the Government anticipates extending invitations to a maximum of five (5) of the most highly qualified offerors to submit Phase 2 proposals, which will be due on or about mid June 2008.  The short listed firms will be issued the Request for Proposal (RFP) package and may undergo a presentation and review process under separate evaluation factors.  Details on the evaluation factors and submittals will be outlined in the RFP.  The Government anticipates making an award in July 2008.  This solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses.  However, this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (F.A.R. 52-219-19).  Any qualified responsible firm, including small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small businesses, is encouraged to participate as prime contractors, or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses, or as subcontractors.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment.  Consequently, an Offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction), must demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  YOU ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF UPLOAD OF THE RFQ AT THIS SITE AND REGISTER ON THE INTERESTED VENDOR LIST (IVL).  In accordance with the requirements of the RFQ, Phase 1 proposals shall be submitted approximately April 25, 2008, by 1:00 PM, EST, to the following address: GSA, NCR, ROB, Bid Activity (WPP) - Room 1065, Seventh and D Streets, SW, Washington, DC 20407.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  The purpose of this second amendment is to answer additional questions in reference to the sources sought synopsis.  The due date for receipt of information is not changed.

7. Question:  In the response to question 5 of the April 3, 2008 amendment,
SSP states:  "Contractors should not assume a restriction to the existing SSBN CONOPS and covertness."  For further clarification, does a requirement still exist for the ESGN Alternative system to meet current system performance accuracy at the maximum fix/reset interval to support United Kingdom operations?  Must the ESGN 	Alternative
System meet accuracy requirements based upon the operational philosophy related to position and velocity fix-taking now	employed in the United Kingdom?

Answer:  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and not a proposal.  SSP wishes to explore all alternatives.  You may note your concerns in your response to the RFI.

CONTACT INFORMATION

RFI responses should be delivered to:

	Ms. Cheryl Wetzel
