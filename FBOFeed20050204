<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009; PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Rubén Alvarado Vigar, Gerente General, Empresa Portuaria San Antonio, Alan Macowan 0245, San Antonio, Chile; Telephone: 011-56-35-586-128, 56-35-586-199; Fax: 011-56-35-586-010.  The Empresa Portuaria San Antonio (“the Grantee”) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Port of San Antonio Logistics Chain Improvement Project.

The Empresa Portuaria San Antonio (EPSA), the autonomous state-owned port company, has administered the port since January 1998.  EPSA manages the public areas of the port; oversees the concessions to private operators; and is responsible for planning the future development of the port.  EPSA also operates the Terminal Multioperado (TEM Terminal), which is available to multiple operators for their cargo movements. US$15 million have been invested over the past three years to upgrade the port’s infrastructure and several new projects are being planned to be implemented during 2005-2009.  The projects include improving both road and rail access, implementing new technologies for access control, and developing an improved electronic system for cargo logistics. The port’s master plan includes the development of a logistics support area and a new entry point to the port.  The port access zone improvement project will involve the expansion of key road arteries and the construction of overpasses at key intersections to facilitate the transit of trucks in and out of the port as well as the upgrade rail connections to the port.  The feasibility study will help EPSA evaluate the potential for improved rail access and greater utilization of rail service to reduce road congestion and increase the overall efficiency of logistics at the port.  The feasibility study will assess the feasibility and operational issues associated with creating an off-port rail intermodal facility.

The feasibility study will help EPSA improve the efficiency of the port’s logistics chain by improving the road and rail access to the port and integrating existing and new electronic information systems.

The feasibility study tasks can be summarized as follows:

Task 1: 	Document Review
Task 2:  	Technical Evaluation 
		2.1 Current Port Operations
		2.2. Port Access
		2.3 Existing Off-Port Facilities and Port Expansion
		2.4 Integration and Linkage Issues
Task 3: 	Equipment and Systems Needs Assessment
Task 4: 	Institutional and Regulatory Assessment
Task 5: 	Economic and Financial Analysis
Task 6:  	Initial Environment Assessment 
Task 7:		Recommendations and Preparation of Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $438,600 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by 5:00pm, March 18, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<CONTACT>Kathy Haluschak Contracting Officer 5032316117 kathy_haluschak@r1.fws.gov;
<DESC>The Santa Maria Airport District (District) is interested in creating California tiger salamander aquatic habitat on the Airport property.  The District would like to convene a team of local experts, including but not limited to, a hydrologist, geologist, and biologist, to develop a protocol for California tiger salamander breeding pond creation.  The District would like to aid in the development of the protocol by offering their property for pond creation efforts.  The team of experts would be chosen in February of 2005, and initial discussions and site visits to the District's property would begin in March.  Pond creation efforts would begin during the dry season (June-September 2005). Providing funds for these efforts would aid in the development of a template or protocol for future efforts to create and enhance aquatic habitat for the California tiger salamander.  These efforts would work towards the conservation and recovery of the California tiger salamander in Santa Barbara County.  The restoration activities resulting from the funding of this project will improve our relationships with the District and other local governments in the City of Santa Maria and Santa Barbara County by working in partnership with their constituents to conserve and restore habitat for the California tiger salamander and thereby promote species recovery and decrease the perception of regulatory burdens.

<DESC>Brookhaven’s International Safeguards Projects Office requires a broad range of services in support of the programs and projects of the U.S. Support Program to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Safeguards.  In engineering, programs and projects include the specification and development of safeguards equipment, project management support, equipment design and development, management consulting, procedure development, performance based training, and equipment development.  These specific subject areas support the IAEA’s mission to field equipment and prepare inspectors for the collection of safeguards data.  In addition, we would like to include a new subject area on analytical services.  This would involve work in feasibility studies, cost benefit analysis, strategic planning, collection and analysis of information from open sources, training in new methods and tools for collection and analysis of open source information, clean laboratory management, technical writing, safeguards studies, and analysis of environmental and destructive samples.  The specific subject areas of interest are described in detail below:
1.  ENGINEERING SERVICES
a.  International Safeguards Equipment:  Equipment used for Nondestructive Analysis (NDA), e.g., neutron and gamma timer/counters, gamma spectroscopy, uranium and plutonium, neptunium and americium attribute verification, coincidence and multiplicity counting; containment and surveillance (digital and analog camera systems and seals): unattended and remote monitoring (data collect and review systems, global communications, and equipment networking including ILON and Ethernet technologies); and uranium enrichment and spent nuclear fuel reprocessing.  Services may include but are not limited to prototype fabrication, technology application studies, design of unique safeguards equipment, software and hardware modifications, network and system configuration support, field support (including troubleshooting) and equipment upgrades.

b.  Project Management Support:  Project management support for international multi-stakeholder projects for the implementation of safeguards, including the development of project plans, user requirements, design specifications, risk analysis and document/software management.  Support may be requested to develop, coordinate and manage the implementation of complex safeguards project systems.  Expertise in developing project plans involving safeguards technologies such as DCM14-based digital surveillance systems and integrated radiation monitoring technologies (e.g., miniGRAND) is desired.

c.  Equipment/System Design Development:  Equipment/system design development including preparation of conceptual designs, requirements definition, development of safeguards technical approaches specific to unique facility types, and performance of independent technical reviews.  Design development is specific to safeguards applications.  Offerors must demonstrate knowledge of safeguards equipment requirements including authentication of data, reliability, and data storage requirements and familiarity with the IAEA’s equipment authorization process.  Offerors selected for design development will be knowledgeable of typical nuclear material diversion scenarios that systems must be designed to mitigate.

d.  Management Consulting:  Management consulting for a large international organization including quality assurance and quality control programs.  The IAEA is in constant need of assistance to strengthen its management processes.  Offerors expert in assisting large international organizations to improve human resource, engineering, and logistical support processes are desired.  Expertise in ISO 9000 standards, Total Quality Management (TQM), strategic planning and facilitation is desired.

e.  Procedure Development for Technical Tasks:  Procedure development for technical tasks including document management and control processes.  The IAEA requires assistance developing technical procedures for equipment use and training and for preventive and corrective maintenance of equipment and systems.  Organizations experienced with developing concise procedures developed from interaction with manufacturers and users while conforming to an established procedure writer’s guide are desired.

f.  Performance-Based Training:  Performance-based training of technical personnel on safeguards equipment and systems such as those identified in 1a.  Expertise in developing and delivering performance-based training of technical subject matter including but not limited to training delivered in a classroom, on-the-job and self-paced setting is expected.  Multimedia and web-based training development experience is desired.  Expertise in delivering training on safeguards technology and customs software applications is desired.

g.  Equipment Testing:  Equipment testing, including acceptance testing, vulnerability testing, independent harsh environmental and design lifetime evaluation.

Testing facilities should have a Quality Assurance Program registered to ISO 9001 and be familiar with the requirements of ISO Guide 17025, which details the quality, data, and calibration processes necessary for the conduct of testing services.  BNL desires an independent testing laboratory that has no financial involvement with the IAEA components that may be tested.  Environmental factors to be considered for testing may include high and low temperature, gamma and neutron radiation, power quality, pressure, high humidity, vibration and shock.

2.  ANALYTICAL SERVICES
a.  Feasibility and Safeguards Technology Studies:  Feasibility and safeguards technology studies including evaluation of alternatives, cost benefits and overall risk analyses.  Organizations selected will demonstrate understanding of IAEA safeguards requirements and cost benefit analysis techniques (e.g., return on investment) to assist BNL and the IAEA in evaluating alternative safeguards systems and approaches.

b.  Open Source Information Collection and Analysis:  Experts to assist with research and documentation of questions of nuclear proliferation are sought.  Expertise in the collection and analysis of open sources of information, including information from scientific literature, newspaper, Internet, and satellite imagery, and knowledge of the tools and methods used for collection and analysis are required.  Tools that can integrate information from disparate data from multiple sources and help the IAEA draw more accurate conclusions are desired.  Knowledge of the nuclear fuel cycle is desired.

c.  Cost Benefit Analysis:  Expertise in the use of cost benefit analysis for decision-making is required.  Cost benefit analysis may be performed in conjunction with equipment development, distribution of resources, or evaluation of alternative safeguards approaches.

d.  Safeguards Studies and Technical Writing:  Individuals with expertise in nuclear nonproliferation, safeguards, instrumentation, and/or project management are needed to assist the IAEA with quality information, policy-oriented research and analysis pertaining to global nonproliferation issues.  Consulting assignments can take place on-site at IAEA Headquarters or in the consultant’s home office.  Excellent verbal and written communication skills for a culturally diverse environment are required.

e.  Environmental and Destructive Sample Analysis:  The IAEA collects environmental and destructive samples from nuclear facilities that must be analyzed.  Experts in the use of specialized techniques are needed to help the IAEA improve their capabilities and develop their strategies to detect undeclared activities.  Specialized techniques are needed for bulk and particle analysis, improving efficiency, and understanding the effects of impurities.

<DESC>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy Colorado, intends to award a sole source commercial purchase order to Agilent Technologies, Inc.  The requirement is to replace the eleven [11] year old LC/GC/Mass Spectrometer for the Chemistry Department at USAFA CO.  The Department of Chemistry has an important need for an ESI/MALDI LC/MSD TOF Mass Spectrometer System to meet the requirements of large molecule inorganics or organometalics, nonvolatile molecules and protein/peptide analysis in advanced chemistry courses and work being done in the chemistry research center.  Time-of-flight mass spectrometry [TOF MS] was developed in the last 1940’s, but until the 1990’s, its popularity was limited.  Recent improvements in TOF technology, including orthogonal acceleration, ion mirrors [reflections], and high-speed electronics, have significantly improved TOF resolution.  This improved resolution, combined with powerful and easy-to-use electrospray [ESI] and matrix-assister laser desorption ionization [MALDI] ion sources, have made TOF MS a core technology for the analysis of both small and large molecules.  Most of the introductory organic or analytical chemistry courses work with volatile organic compounds that can easily be analyzed on Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometers [GCMS.  As chemistry courses advance into courses such as Biochemistry, Macro Biochemistry and Materials Science studies larger and more complex molecules are studied.  To work with these large molecules, a new type of sample introduction process is needed to transfer, separate and inject Liquid Chromatography [LC] into a mass spectrometer [TOF MS].  As well as being an extremely sensitive detection system [TOF MS] can separate large proteins and peptides, like RNA and DNA for example.  The purpose for this sole source acquisition is to provide a more “user friendly”, easy to maintain, and highly technological ESI/MALDI LC/MSD TOF Mass Spectrometer System that is capable of meeting the needs of the USAFA Chemistry Department, departmental teaching criteria and student ease of use requirements.  The Agilent Technologies model 1100 series ESI/MALDI/ LC/MSD TOF Mass Spectrometer System is the only brand name/sole source that can satisfy the government’s requirements.  The North America Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 334516 and the size standard is 500 employees.  All responsible sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by 10MSG/LGCB.  This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.  “See Note 22”.

<CONTACT>Sarah J. Welch Contract Specialist 360873459011   Sarah_Welch@nps.gov;
<DESC>PROJECT SUMMARY:  The National Park Service is seeking offers for a firm, fixed-price contract for the design and construction of an approximately 120' long, 6' wide hiker/stock trail bridge, located approximately 1.5 miles from the nearest road access.  The bridge will probably have concrete spread footings with three steel girders, timber deck, and railing.  It is anticipated that the bridge will be designed with two splices in each girder, with each girder section weighing approx 4,000 lbs.  The east side will have a short approach.  The contractor shall provide a completed final design for NPS approval, based on the preliminary design and parameters in the solicitation.  This project is not located in designated wilderness, so mechanized equipment will be allowed on site.  Offerors should be aware that a final decision to build the bridge at this site awaits completion of the NEPA process.  Estimated start work date is April 5, 2005 with estimated project completion date of June 24, 2005. SOLICITATION DETAILS:  This is a best value procurement subject to the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program and set-aside for certified HUBZone business concerns.  The NAICS code for this project is 237310 and the small business size standard is $28,500,000.   In accordance with FAR Subpart 36.204, the price range for this contract is between $100,000 and $250,000.   Performance and payment bonds will be required for this project.  The electronic Request for Proposals will be available on approximately February 18, 2005, at www.fedbizopps.gov and http://ideasec.nbc.gov. In order to download the solicitation, interested vendors must register at  http://ideasec.nbc.gov and maintain an active registration at http://www.ccr.gov.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.  PROJECT LOCATION:  To reach project site take State Route 20 east from Interstate 5 approximately 70 miles to the Colonial Creek Campground. Hike the trail up Thunder Creek approximately 3/4 mile to the old crossing location (washed out in October, 2003, by flood waters and woody debris).  Follow blue flagging up the west side another 3/4 mile to the bridge site where Abutment #1 is staked (Sta 1+00).  There are two alternate alignments (A & B) which are about 14 degrees apart.  A is more perpendicular to the creek and B is skewed approximately 30' upstream at Abutment #2. Abutment #2 (east side) is adjacent to the Thunder Creek Campground.  Note: The trail to Abutment #1 will be constructed by National Park Service crews in spring of 2005 but may not be done prior to bridge construction.  Cellular phones do not work in this area.   More information on the park, including maps, is available at http://www.nps.gov/noca/

The four original tasks that were performed under the initial effort and will be continued through this effort are as follows: •	The generation of software metrics •	The collection and storage of software metrics •	The delivery of software metrics to NASA Projects and the research community •	The error data enhancement program The continuation of the four original tasks serves to improve the statistical viability of the repository, to improve the quality of the software artifact data, and to continue to support the special data needs of the research community.  The purpose of this is to improve the statistical viability of the project.   There are three additional tasks that require the use of Galaxy Global Corporation’s proprietary scripts and software.  This includes expanding MDP error prediction capability by acquiring and integrating machine learning into the current Galaxy Global Corporation’s application.  The integration requires the knowledge of Galaxy Global Corporation’s scripts and software.  The three additional tasks are as follows: •	Acquire and integrate a Program Management / Machine Learning Tool capability for Intra-Center Repository (Glenn Research Center) •	Maintain Intra-Center Centralized Repository Database for Glenn Research Center •	Develop maintenance utility software and documentation that will enable the future maintenance of the MDP data repository.	The maintenance software and documentation shall be constructed to allow individuals that are not thoroughly familiar with the system to perform maintenance and upgrades.   NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Galaxy Global Corporation 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) 1, only One Responsible Source.  Galaxy Global's proprietary knowledge and computer software, built with their own funds, forms the backbone of the MDP system.  Galaxy Global has demonstrated their ability to perform this effort based on their prior 6 years of experience supporting NASA projects in developing meaningful metrics to prioritize the approach for code level inspection and analysis.  The scripting and supporting computer software developed by Galaxy Global Corporation to accomplish these tasks is proprietary to Galaxy Global Corporation.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) invites you to submit a proposal for small class expendable launch vehicle services to be provided under the NASA Launch Services (NLS) contract.  The original NASA Launch Services (NLS) RFP was issued on October 18, 1999, resulting in the award of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contracts to Boeing Delta Launch Services, Inc. and Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch Services, Inc.  The original solicitation remains open until June 30, 2010 through the use of an innovative on-ramp provision found in Section C, Clause 2.0.   On a semi-annual basis, NASA invites new, emerging domestic launch service providers that meet the minimum contract requirements and current contract holders who wish to on-ramp new launch services to submit proposals during an open season.  The open season for proposal submission is the entire month of February and August of each calendar year.	 The synopsis notice posted on February 6, 2004 for the February 2004 open season included a notice that NASA anticipated the issuance of a separate synopsis for expansion of the NLS performance range to include small class expendable launch vehicle services.   Pursuant to that notice, this synopsis invites current NLS contract holders and new emerging domestic launch providers that meet the minimum contract requirements for small class launch vehicle services to submit on-ramp proposals to NASA in accordance with the instructions in this notice.   This performance range expansion is consistent with RFP Section C, Clause 2.3, “Expansion of Performance Capabilities”.  Minimum NLS launch capabilities are generally described in the solicitation as the capability to deliver a 1500kg payload to orbit at an altitude of 200km and a launch inclination of 28.5 degrees.   The solicitation is being amended in accordance with Section C, Clause 2.3 to expand the performance range capabilities by reducing the minimum payload delivery capability from 1500kg to  250kg, with altitude and inclination as referenced above.   On or about March 22, 2004, the revised solicitation will be released as RFP 10-00-0021, Revision 1.  Upon release, an open season for small class expendable launch vehicle services proposals will commence, with proposals due 60 days from the date Revision 1 is issued.   During this open season, NASA will entertain proposals for small class launch services, defined as those launch services for payloads between the amended minimum capability (250kg) and the previous NLS minimum capability (1500kg).   Future NLS open seasons will invite proposals for the full range of NLS performance, including medium/heavy capability as well as the newly added small class capability. NASA will conduct a Pre-Proposal Conference at KSC on or about April 6, 2004 to familiarize potential offerors with the NLS solicitation, and answer questions concerning the solicitation.  Companies interested in attending this Conference must advise the Contracting Officer (see Point of Contact information at the end of the synopsis) by no later than March 29, 2004, and provide the names of the personnel who wish to attend. Proposals should be mailed or hand carried to:  NASA, John F. Kennedy Space Center Mail Stop: OP-LS, Attn: Jeanette A. Platt, Operations and Checkout (O&C) Building, M7-355 (Room No. 2015) Kennedy Space Center, Florida 32899.   Offerors wishing to hand carry offers must first make arrangements to access Kennedy Space Center with the Point(s) of Contact listed at the end of this synopsis.  MARK: RFP 10-99-0021; TO BE OPENED BY ADDRESSEE ONLY  This acquisition is restricted to domestic sources. Minimum contract requirements are set forth in Attachment E3, Paragraph 1.0 of the NLS RFP. An official of the company who is authorized to bind the company must sign your proposal. Your proposal must also contain a statement that the offer is firm for a period of 180 days from your submittal date.   You must provide the company name and complete address (including street, city, state, and zip code), and the Cage Code or Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, applicable to that name and address.	 The RFP does not commit the Government to award a contract nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any cost incurred in the preparation and submittal of proposals or in anticipation of a contract. The Government reserves the right to reject any and all proposals should such action be in the interest of the Government.  The Attachments to the NLS RFP are an integral part hereof. If you fail to obtain or locate any part of the RFP, promptly notify Jeanette A. Platt at (321)867-7286 or Jeanne A. Burkhart at (321) 867-3475.   NLS acquisition information can be obtained via the Internet at the following address: http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/procurement/nls. Offerors are hereby notified that funds are not presently available for this effort. The Government's obligation is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. It is anticipated that funds will be available at the time of contract award.

RFI TECHNICAL INFORMATION:Ultra-Sensitive Detectors___________

A. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

A. INTRODUCTION
__________
The Department Of Defense (DOD) is interested in receiving proposals for very high frame rate, high bandwidth, low noise detection systems for applications in laser ranging and detection.  The delivered system will consist of a detector, associated electronics needed to amplify and digitize the detector signal, cooling hardware, and documentation.  The program will consist of three possibly overlapping phases for a total of 36 months: 
____________
Phase 1 will span 12 months, and contractors are encouraged to demonstrate key elements of their technical approach such as system gain or read out noise that contributes to their system’s high sensitivity.  This elemental performance should be combined with detailed modeling to illustrate the contractor’s technical approach will meet the program’s detection goals. We would expect that a phase-ending CDR would produce a camera design that the contractor expects could meet the specification goals.
____________
Phase 2 will cover fabrication of the detector and multiplexer units into a hybridized detection system in 18 months. 
____________
Phase 3 will cover final design documentation, integration, testing and delivery within a 6-month period to a Government facility of the complete detection system that meets all technical performance listed herein.  
___________
The Government anticipates awarding at most two contracts for this effort during phase 1, with a down select for phase 2 and 3.  The anticipated magnitude of effort for this project is approximately $2.5M per year over 3 years but this amount is neither guaranteed nor is the Government obligated to meet this budget in the future.  The projected start date is anticipated to  be during the second quarter FY05 but is dependent upon availability of funding and the results of the contracting process.  Open communication with the technical point of contact (POC), Dr. Jim Riker, at 808-874-1619, is encouraged until proposals are received.  Contracting questions should be directed to Capt Dax Presuto at 505-846-0758 or dax.presuto@kirtland.af.mil.  
___________
B.	TECHNICAL TOPIC AREA:
Contractors funded under this Ultra-Sensitive Detector (USD) development program will use modeling and simulation, analysis, design, experimentation, and testing to develop, fabricate, demonstrate and deliver a high frame rate (10 kHz), high bandwidth (>1 GHz), low noise (<1-photon per pixel per frame Noise Equivalent Input (NEI)) to the DOD.  Emphasis will be placed on system architectures that are favorable in terms of size, weight, affordability, and reliability while trying to meet the program technical performance goals.  The contractor is expected to address these issues both in the proposal and throughout program execution if a proposal is requested via BAA.
____________
The applications we envision for this detection system development include laser ranging and detection of targets, with as much information as possible provided from the image processor to assist in target identification.  Laser ranging means placing a laser on a distant target and resolving the return pulse in the detector output and being able to resolve depth characteristics to a resolution of 20 cm or less (350 psec).  Our intent is to be able to do this in an array format, with at least 4 x 4 pixels used to sense the return at the highest temporal resolution.  This effort will push the state-of-the-art in 3D imaging (angle-angle-range) at the highest sensitivity yet demonstrated.  The approach should show scaling to larger array formats.  
___________
The Government expects to do the ranging, detection, and identification functions outside of the FPA.  In order to accomplish that, we need the detector to have certain capabilities in terms of noise performance, array readout times (frame rates), pixel readout times (bandwidth), etc.  We do not expect the detector developer to have to consider system-related issues such as where the laser source is located, where any “targets” are located, or whether the laser and detector share the same optics.  However, because of system issues like shared aperture operations with lasers and cameras, we have a specification on image persistence.
____________
MIT/LL has developed Geiger Mode Arrays using InGaAs responsive in the desired wavelength region (1.0-1.7 microns). These devices, which are still in development, should emulate their successful work with Silicon in a 32 by 32 format.  The limitations on the LL technology in meeting the government goals are that they are Geiger mode and typically have quench times of 100 ns per pixel.  The government believes that this technology can still meet the program goals specified below when the signal regime is limited to well below 1 photon per detection/pixel or the imaged spot encompasses multiple pixels.  Contractors are encouraged to consider the current state-of –the-art in the Lincoln Labs work and consider licensing it as a path to achieve the government’s detector/camera goals.  The government is looking for the best approach to achieve pixelized detection of single photons in a linear detection mode.
____________
The DOD is specifically interested in approaches that address the camera output performance requirements listed in the paragraphs below.  We have divided the specification into detector (or Focal Plane Array (FPA)) requirements, system performance requirements, functional requirements, packaging requirements, and documentation requirements.  The delivered detector system is to consist of the sensor FPA, associated electronics needed to amplify and digitize the sensor signal, electronics housing, cooling hardware, and documentation.  For large arrays, an electronic multiplexer to rapidly read out the full array or subsets of the array is desirable.  If the device has unique environmental issues, packaging appropriate to breadboard demonstration within a laboratory environment should be offered.  The number of ports should be compatible with the desired frame rate and bandwidth for the overall system.  
___________
FPA SPECIFICATION GOALS, in decreasing order of importance:
1)	Wavelength Response: The FPA shall detect near-infrared photons in the region 1.0-1.7 microns.  High quantum efficiency (>0.65 over the entire 1-1.7 micron range) is desirable to maximize the overall system performance.  Specific laser lines of interest for this program include the 1.029-m Yb:YAG line and the 1.064-m Nd:YAG line.
2)	Array Size: The FPA shall be produced in an array format for tracking, wave-front sensing, imaging, and scoring applications, with designs supporting array sizes of at least 4 x 4.  Scaling to larger sizes, up to 64x64, are considered a plus.  
3)	Bandwidth: The detector bandwidth shall exceed 1 GHz or a response time of at least 350 ps.  Electronics can be coupled directly to the detector pixels if necessary.  Our expectation is to be able to resolve individual laser pulses whose rise time is greater than about 350 ps and whose overall pulse-length exceeds 1 ns.  Depending on the ranging system geometry, signal levels, detector and read-out noise, off-chip processing algorithms, and other factors, we expect that this detector capability will provide range-resolution to below 20 cm.
4)	Pixel Pitch 60 microns or greater. 
5)	Pixel Well Size: The detector shall have a well size adequate to support 11 bits of corrected dynamic range with the specified noise level, to permit operations in scintillated laser environments.
6)	Pixel Fill: The pixel fill factor shall be greater than 80%, meaning that at least 80% of the Focal Plane Array (FPA) area is to respond to light.  This requirement recognizes that certain technologies, such as Avalanche Photo-Diodes (APD), may not be able to produce the desired 100% fill factor.  But detectors that can match the other requirements while achieving 100% fill factor will be considered a plus.  Micro-lens arrays or other separate optics integrated with the detector elements are an acceptable approach to achieve the required fill factors and are encouraged to minimize radiation response should these devices ever be applied in radiation rich environments.
7)	Gain Non-uniformity: The non-uniformity in gain from pixel to pixel shall be less than 10% of full scale when the detector is operated at its maximum rate for a 20-microsecond integration.  Non-uniformity across a single pixel shall be less than 5% on the part of the array that is responsive.
8)	Offset (or Bias) Drift: The digitized offset drift shall be less than twice the median noise level over a period of 3 minutes, in order to facilitate stable calibration and use.
9)	FPA Operation: The FPA shall operate under simultaneous (or snapshot) integration.  This mode of operation refers to simultaneously integrating and resetting all pixels together, as opposed to a rolling integration where some pixels are reset while others are integrating.
10)	 Multiple modes of engagement should be offered in the signal processing software and hardware.  100 bins covering a maximum of 10 microseconds should form one limit while the other limiting mode should strive for 100 or more bins within 20 nanoseconds.  
11)	As suggested the device should be able to detect minimum signal levels below 1 photon and maximum signal levels to 10,000 photons.  In addition the device should not be damaged with incident signal levels of up to a 1000 times higher and should recover from such incidence within 80 microseconds.
_____________
DETECTION SYSTEM SPECIFICATION GOALS, in decreasing order of importance:
1)	Noise Equivalent Input (NEI): The overall system noise performance shall be less than 0.4 photons per frame per pixel RMS, at a wavelength of 1064 nm as measured and averaged over a 20 micro-second exposure gate.  The noise value quoted here represents all noise sources.
2)	Frame Rate: The frame rate is defined as the inverse of the sum of the integration time, read-out time, and dead time (defined below).  The system shall have a frame rate that is at least 10 kHz.
3)	Integration Time: The time during which the camera will integrate charge is within the range 0.3 ns to 20 microseconds.  The integration is to be controlled by the user with a single differential control line, and the system should be able to integrate while reading out.  The duration of the integration time must be capable of being set by the user through software inputs.  It is recommended that at least three discrete time modes are offered, and more flexibility would be a plus.  The rise time of the integration shall be less than 350 ps from the 10% to 90% points.  The fall time should be the same.  The frame-to-frame temporal response uncertainty of the camera integration gate with respect to a 1-ns rise-time step synchronization trigger shall be less than 1 ns.  The residual charge after a camera clear command shall be less than ½ the NEI.
4)	Frame Readout Time: The time for a complete read-out of the full array shall be less than 100 ms.  
5)	Dead Time: The delay between the integration period and the readout period shall be less than 35 ns.  
6)	Dynamic Range: The output data shall have a dynamic range after correction of 11 bits.  That is, the dynamic range after correction for offset and gain is to be greater than 2048:1.
7)	Non-Uniformity Correction: Pixel non-uniformities shall be correctable with linear two-point gain-offset Non-Uniformity Correction (NUC) algorithms to better than 1%.  After correction, the camera response should be linear to better than 2% when measured as the maximum deviation from the best linear fit over the full dynamic range.
8)	Cross-talk: The cross-talk due to all processes as measured in the recorded frame shall be such that less than 5% of the electrons are collected in the adjacent pixel when the light falls within 2 microns of the edge.  The cross-talk shall be less than 0.5% for non-adjacent pixels.
9)	Operability: After corrections for offset and gain, 95% of the pixels shall meet or exceed the specification for linearity, dynamic range, and noise.  At least 99.8% of the pixels shall be within 50% of the specification for linearity, dynamic range, and noise.  In wave-front sensor mode, 100% of the read out pixels shall be operable.
10)	Image Persistence: Subsequent frame latent images shall be less than 1% of the original frame.  Charge generated during the reset period shall be reduced to 1 part in 10,000 within 80 micro-seconds of generation.
___________
SYSTEM FUNCTIONS SET BY USER:
1)	Frame Start: The start of the frame shall be synchronized to an externally provided trigger.
2)	Sub-array Row/Column Placement: The user shall specify the sub-framing of the array by identifying the upper and left-most sub-frame pixel and the number of rows and columns within the sub-frame.
3)	The integration duration of the sensor is to be controllable in the range 20 ns to 20 microseconds in discreet modes or continuously.  It is to integrate photon input during this period.  Prior to the integration period, photo-induced electrons are not to be integrated.  Following the integration, readout should take place within 35 ns.
_________
PACKAGE GOALS, in decreasing order of importance:

The package is desired to be applicable to a laboratory environment, maintenance-free (yet with accessibility for repairs), and protective of sensitive components, cables, and cooling lines.  All cables are to be properly stress-relieved.  All cooling accessories needed for detector operability shall be provided with the system.

1)	Operating Temperature: The system must meet specifications at a temperature of 240-K or greater.  This specification should be interpreted to mean that we desire Thermo-Electric Cooling of the camera system, as opposed to cryogenic coolers.
2)	Field Of View (FOV) of Detector Package Assembly: To facilitate high-magnification optical systems, the FOV shall exceed 66 degrees.
3)	Mechanical Interface: The FPA/read-out electronics shall have a standard interface.  The cable length from the FPA to the electronics shall be greater than 2 feet.  The detector housing shall have a flat base mounting plate.  The detection system shall be able to fit within a 25-cm by 25-cm square area.  
4)	Detector Head Cooling: Cold-air cooling (at 15 SCFM and less than 45 degrees F) of the detector head is preferred, but water-jacket cooled versions of the system are also of interest.
5)	Detector Output: the output shall be differential digital from the detector head to the processing electronics.  Timing signals to and from the detector should use 50-ohm single-ended BNC connections.
6)	Initial Alignment Fiducial: A fiducial indicating detector position relative to the detector housing shall be provided for the initial alignment of the optical system.
____________
Documentation required if BAA is Released:

In addition to the deliverables called out in the BAA, the following specific documents are required:

1)	System description
2)	Operating instructions
3)	Required power, grounding, external signals, cooling, environmental with maximum and minimum ratings
4)	Trouble-shooting guide with accessible test points
5)	Electrical schematic
6)	Mechanical schematic
7)	Acceptance measurements results with a short description of the test procedures.  At a minimum, we expect that the contractor would supply photon transfer curves, spot scan measurements, temporal response measurements, and quantum efficiency data.

The contractor shall discuss in the proposal how to measure the system performance, using standard metrics such as responsivity, detectivity, noise equivalent power (or irradiance), or D-star.  The contractor must also define and discuss how measurements will be made to prove performance on the set of requirements listed above.  Finally, the contractor should include some discussion of the test facilities needed and available to make these measurements.

RFI TECHNICAL INFORMATION: Advanced Diagnostics
___________
A. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

1.0  BACKGROUND:

The need for advanced diagnostics has been identified as a major obstacle to understanding the operational dynamics of chemical lasers and COILs in particular.  This RFI intends to attain industry information on the viability of releasing a BAA that will seek proposals for creating diagnostics with the objective of filling recognized gaps in the instrumentation of current laser devices. Diagnostics are needed for types of measurements in 2.1 and 2.2 below.
___________
2.0  REQUIREMENTS:

2.1  Measurement of oxygen species.  The molecular oxygen species to be detected include O2(X3S), O2(a1D), and O2(b1S).  Diagnostics proposed under this topic shall quantitatively measure at least two and preferably all three of these molecular species.  All measurements in the laser devices shall be made in situ during short duration (typically 10 sec) experiments.  Measuring the concentration at a rate of 25 Hz or better is preferred for time evolution studies; however, slower data rates will be considered.  Simultaneous measurement of the oxygen species is preferred; however, sequential measurement will be acceptable.  The offeror should assume that the optical path-length will not exceed five (5) cm, however, multi-pass configurations may be used to increase the effective path length.  The following table lists the minimum acceptable detection limits. 
Species	Number density (molecules cm-3)
	Threshold	Objective
O2(X3S)	1 x 1014	1 x 1013
O2(a1D)	1 x 1014	1 x 1013
O2(b1S)	1 x 1014	1 x 1013

______________
2.2  Measurement of molecular iodine.  Molecular iodine in its ground electronic state shall be measured with very high accuracy at low concentration.  Diagnostics proposed under this topic need to quantitatively measure iodine in situ during the short duration (typically 10 sec) experiments.  Measuring the concentration at a rate of 25 Hz or better is preferred for time evolution studies; however, slower data rates will be considered.  The offeror should assume that the optical path-length will not exceed five (5) cm, however, multi-pass configurations may be used to increase the effective pathlength. The following table lists the minimum acceptable detection limits: 
Species	Number density (molecules cm-3)
	Threshold	Objective
Iodine	1 x 1012	1 x 1011
____________
3.0  PROPOSED SCHEDULE:

The expected period of performance for this advanced diagnostics effort is approximately 7 months with the end product being delivery of the two diagnostic units. The intended program milestones are as follows: after 3 months of design work the contractor shall hold a technical interchange meeting with members from the ABL SPO and AFRL/DE.  The objective of this meeting is for the contractor to gain approval to continue with the current design.  After this meeting, there is a three-month period designated for fabrication of the hardware, integration and test, after which the prototype(s) are expected to be delivered. 
__________
The Government anticipates awarding one contract for each diagnostic effort, unless the same contractor can provide both.  The anticipated magnitude of effort for this project is approximately <$500K total, but this amount is neither guaranteed nor is the Government obligated to meet this budget in the future.  The projected start date is anticipated to be during the second quarter FY05 but is dependent upon availability of funding and the results of the contracting process.  Open communication with the technical point of contact (POC), 1Lt Heather Pietrzyk, at 808-853-3779 or heather.pietrzyk@kirtland.af.mil, is encouraged until proposals are received (if BAA is released).  Contracting questions should be directed to Capt Dax Presuto at 505-846-0758 or dax.presuto@kirtland.af.mil.  

__________________________________________________________________
SUGGESTED QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER:

Following are some specific questions and/or response guidelines for this RFI.  Contractors should freely make any other comments or suggestions on areas not discussed here.

1)	From both technical and programmatic viewpoints, does the contractor believe that the methodologies/requirements discussed above would provide a viable path to completion of the program objectives within the cost and schedule constraints specified?

<DESC>Operational Contracting, US Air Force Academy intends to award a sole source contract utilizing simplified acquisition procedures to Josephson Institute of Ethics, a non-profit corporate entity, for a spiritual climate review.  The requirement is to assist the Chaplain Service of the USAFA Cadet Chapel in conducting a review of broad-based spiritual and formational matters-of-conscience programs/curricula at the Air Force Academy.  The contractor shall be familiar with military requirements, cross-military requirements, and the Officer Development System and must be an expert in ethics, broad-based spirituality, formational matters-of-conscience, and character education/development.  Material from all USAFA programs/curricula (including the USAFA Cadet and 10th Air Base Wing Community Center Chapels, 34th TRW, Dean of Faculty, and USAFA Preparatory School) dealing with broad-based spiritual and formational matters-of-conscience will be reviewed by the contractor.  The contractor must understand the culture and climate of the Air Force Academy, U.S. Military Academy, and Naval Academy.  This is a sole source acquisition approved in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.    Josephson Institute of Ethics is the only source capable of fulfilling the Government's requirement.  No other type of supply or service will satisfy agency requirements.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested companies who feel they meet the requirements identified must submit a detailed capability package by the date and time identified herein for consideration.  If no response is received by 11 February 2005, 12:00PM Noon, MDT, to the effect that comparable supplies and/or services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining supplies and/or services through a sole source procurement with Josephson Institute of Ethics, a sole source award will be made.

<DESC>In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 631 and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5), the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Laguna Industries of Laguna, NM, as a certified HUBZone contractor for enhancements to the Voice Response Translator (VRT) provided under contract USZA22-03-C-0049. On 18 April 2003, USSOCOM issued a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Biomedical Research. Under this BAA, the Laguna VRT was proposed for medical use. The VRT was evaluated, and recommendations for USSOCOM enhancements were made. The purpose of this sole source HUBZone requirement is to incorporate these enhancements into the VRT.  It is anticipated that Laguna will incorporate these enhancements into the VRT and provide five laboratory units and fifty test units for field-testing. The reason justifying the lack of competition is twofold. First, 15 U.S.C. 631 and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5) specifically permit a Government agency, such as the USSOCOM, to enter into a contract with a certified HUBZone contractor as long as the conditions in FAR 19.1306(a) are met. The USSOCOM has determined that all the conditions set forth in FAR 19.1306(a) exist.  Second, USSOCOM does not own the data rights or have any schematic drawings to the VRT provided under contract USZA22-03-C-0049.  Therefore, even if another certified HUBZone contractor exists, there is no technical data for them to perform the required enhancements.  Note 22 applies. All questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via fax or email to Mr. Charlie Bright, (813) 828-7504; email: brightc@socom.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NOTE:  THIS SYNOPSIS HAS BEEN CHANGED. The website to register for the B-52 Stand-off Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson  AFB on 16 – 17 Feb 2005 is located at the following address: www.usasymposium.com/b52h B-52H Standoff Jammer The B-52 Systems Squadron, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is preparing to issue a  Request for Proposal (RFP)for a Lead System Integrator for the pre-Systems  Design and Development (pre-SDD) phase of the B-52 Standoff Jammer (SOJ) Program.  This announcement is being posted to provide information about the  program to prospective bidders.  Questions may be submitted to the points of  contact listed at the bottom of this announcement.  We will update this  announcement by posting the questions and our responses in a Bidders Library  that will be placed at the end of this announcement.  This acquisition involves data that are subject to export control laws and  regulations.  It has been determined that foreign companies will not be  permitted to participate in this acquisition at the prime contract level.   Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics  Services Center (DLSC) +http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/+ and have a legitimate  business purpose may participate in this solicitation. Contact the Defense  Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan  40917-3084 (1-800-352-3572) for further information on the certification  process. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military  Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal. REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of a Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD)  contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for  a Lead System Integrator in the July 2005 timeframe.  This Lead System  Integrator must possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be Lead  System Integrator of the B-52 SOJ component of the Airborne Electronic Attack  (AEA) System of Systems (SoS) for use by United States Air Force (USAF)  personnel.  The nature of this effort will require access to SECRET or higher  and NOFORN material.   Background The B-52 SOJ will be a core component of the AEA System of Systems.  Other key  AEA components are anticipated to include a jammer variant of the Miniature  Air Launched Decoy (MALD), EC-130H with enhanced jamming pods (Compass Call),  inherent EA capability of Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA) on board  F/A-22s, F-35s, and other AESA-equipped aircraft, the Navy+s EA-6B Improved  Capability III (ICAP III) and EA-18G, and the network/protocols to link these  capabilities.  Some of the key technologies that will be involved include, but  are not limited to: sensitive accurate direction finding Radio Frequency (RF)  receivers, high power relatively broad band directional RF transmitters,  appropriate command and control and on-scene (local) electronic attack (EA)  asset management functions, line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight networking,  and advanced electronic warfare techniques generation and integration.  A  detailed overview of the B-52 SOJ will be presented at the B-52 Stand-off  Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson AFB on 16 –  17 Feb 2005.  Additional information for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will  be added to this site as soon as possible.  Further data can be obtained from  the points of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement. Current Environment Concept refinement of the AEA SoS and, in turn, B-52 SOJ, is in process.  An  AEA Analysis of Alternatives was completed in 2001 and forms the basis for  overall AEA capability requirements.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)  for AEA was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in Nov 2004.   The B-52H, in its fourth decade of operational service, provides the country  with immediate nuclear and conventional global power projection. There are  presently 93 aircraft in service, operating from two Main Operating Bases  (Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB) with the exception of two stationed at Edwards  AFB for flight testing.  Several modifications are underway or planned for the  B-52H to increase or sustain its capabilities.  A key requirement of the SOJ  is that it shall not degrade any current capabilities on the B-52H.  In  addition, the SOJ design and modification will need to be integrated with  other on-going B-52H modifications.   Contract Descriptions The objective for award of the pre-SDD contract is fourth quarter FY05.   The  approximately 2-year period of performance would include identifying and  evaluating existing technologies and associated suppliers needed to meet SOJ  requirements; reducing the risk or developing a plan for managing the risk  associated with those technologies in SDD; assisting the Air Force in planning  for SDD (including developing spiral development strategies, if applicable)  and accomplishing B-52 SOJ Milestone B (approval for entry into the SDD  phase), and other related tasks.   The Lead System Integrator will be expected to develop and execute a best  value strategy to manage the risks associated with selecting, integrating, and  sustaining SOJ components of varying technological maturity into a cohesive,  scalable/expandable B-52 subsystem.  The Government will require insight into  the integrating contractor’s subcontract and vendor selection process and  decision methodology.  The integrating contractor will be expected to execute,  in partnership with the Air Force, a robust systems engineering process that  includes subcontractors and vendors and to perform all planning necessary to  be able to field and sustain the SOJ capability following its development.   The SOJ capability will complement and shall not degrade the aircraft’s strike  (both nuclear and non-nuclear) capabilities.  Full weapons carriage capability  shall be maintained.  Lastly, it is recognized that because of the B-52  experience and expertise that the Boeing Co. (the B-52 OEM) has built up over  the years, that its involvement will be necessary.  Thus, the Lead System  Integrator will be expected to interface with the Boeing Company or provide a  realistic plan describing how the bidder would accomplish the objectives of  the program without a Boeing interface.

<DESC>UPDATE, 4 FEB 05:  This update further elaborates on Question 23 and our response in the “Industry Questions and Responses 26 Jan 05”  attachment: Q23.  Over and Above schedule for source selection evaluation purposes  is located in the Bidder+s Library.  Today the contractor cannot find  such information in the Bidder+s Library.  Recommend a) Populate the  Bidders Library with the required information or b) have the Offeror  assume 1 occurrence per year and insert a units/per occurrence price. A23.  This schedule is in the bidder+s library.  It is listed under  "PWS Referenced Documents/Aircraft Maintenance Manuals" - 1T-6A-6 insp  Req Bidders Copy.pdf. The schedule is in bidder’s library under Section III of 1T-6A-6.   However, upon further review, it appears bidders would have to make  several assumptions.  Therefore, bidders should bid the Over and Above  Fixed Price CLINs (X006) using a quantity of one with the unit price.   Bidders should also indicate if there will be any discount for quantity  breaks.  Bidders need to review the requirements in the 1T-6A-6 insp Req Bidders copy. Amendment 0002 to the Request for Proposal has been posted to the PIXS which incorporates the above changes in Section L of the RFP.  The amendment also makes corrections/clarifications in Sections B, I and K. The hour and date for receipt of proposals has not been extended.  UPDATE, 28 JAN 05:  Amendment 0001 to the Request for Proposal (RFP), released on 12 January 05, has been posted to the PIXS. An updated Acquisition Schedule is also posted.  The Government  must delay award of the COMBS Services contract until receipt of FY06 funding to ensure that obligation of the minimum purchase amount occurs at contract award.  Therefore, contract award has been changed from 1 September 2005 to 1 November 2005.  There are no other changes to the Acquisition Schedule.  The hour and date for receipt of offers has not been extended. UPDATE, 26 JAN 05:  In response to RFP Technical Clarifications  requests submitted by prospective offerors in accordance with RFP  Section L015, Government responses are hereby posted to the PIXS.   Some of these answers will result in administrative changes to the  RFP and will be posted via RFP Amendment 0001 within the next week.   Note:  No extension to the proposal submittal date will be authorized  in Amendment 0001.   UPDATE, 12 JAN 05:  The Bidders Library list has been posted.  If you need copies of files contained in the library, please contact Cheryle Lankford or Capt. Jason Ortiz.  A CD will be provided upon request. UPDATE, 12 JAN 05:  The final RFP is hereby released.  Also attached are the Acquisition Schedule and 2 PCO letters (Source Selection  Notification and Request for Proposal).  Please note Shannon Prince is no longer a POC for this effort.  The current POCs are:  Cheryle Lankford (937-904-4197), Capt. Jason Ortiz (937-904-4609) and Trini Rendon (937-904-4286). UPDATE, 3 JAN 05:  Regarding the Draft RFP posted 30 Dec 04, please be advised that the updated DRAFT RFP has a potential for up to a 10  year period of performance as opposed to the original 5 year period of performance.  All comments/questions to the current Draft RFP  should be received no later than 12:00 EST on 10 Jan 05.  The  Government may not respond with direct answers but may incorporate  comments into the Final RFP. UPDATE, 30 DEC 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) in response to the questions/comments to the DRFP posted 3 Nov 04.  Only documents with changes/updates are posted.  This includes the updated DRFP, Section L and Section M.  Blue change bars highlight changes made.  A document entitled "Industry Questions and Responses, 30 Dec 04" has also been posted.  Questions can be directed to Cheryle Lankford, 937-904-4197, or Capt. Jason Ortiz, 937-904-4609.  UPDATE, 24 NOV 04:  Our e-mail system went down November 12 and was out not fixed until sometime the following week.  As a result, some e-mail  was lost.  If you sent an e-mail responding to the draft RFP during that  time, it may not have been received.  If an e-mail was sent and you did not receive any response from our office advising receipt of the e-mail, please resubmit.  We apologize for any inconvenience. UPDATE, 4 NOV 04:  The files posted 3 Nov 04 for Attachment 2 (MESL) and  Attachment 3 (MESM)were incorrect as the titles had been erroneously  switched for the files.  These files have been deleted and the correct files have been reposted with a 4 Nov 04 date. UPDATE, 3 NOV 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP).  Please review the document in its entirety and submit comments and/or questions to the Contract Specialist cited therein no later than close of business 19 Nov  2004.  Comments may be submitted electronically.  If mailed, they must be  postmarked by close of business 19 Nov 2004. Please note that there has been one slight update to the Government  requirement.  In addition to the previously identified locations requiring COMBS Services support, the Government has updated the DRFP to now also include T-6 Modification Line or any other depot level repair location as part of the requirement.  The T-6 Modification Line is currently located at the Raytheon Aircraft Facility in Wichita, KS.  The requirement involves providing safety of flight parts support for aircraft on the mod line that have component failure unrelated to work performed at that location. UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become  mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/ bidders will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.   Contractors who already are registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) can get a head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca  to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond  what ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.

We are proposing a requirement to require all incoming and  outgoing material to be shipped to a centralized location in order to confirm  receipt + verification of correct asset, accuracy of shipping documents and to  perform a final inspection before shipment.  Since cost is also a priority for  our customers, we don’t want this to result in a large price increase.  We  would like your comments concerning the best commercial practices for this  requirement.  Is there a better way to ensure asset in-transit visibility?   Please provide your comments by 3 December 2004. NOTE: All Prospective Offerors:  Please review all updated attached files  below and provide your comments and questions by 3 December 2004.  It is  important that you provide your comments and questions because they will be  used in developing the final Request for Proposal (RFP).  There are two areas  of particular interest we would like to hear from industry.  First, is how to  handle Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) after contract completion.  Secondly,  some of the foreign PROS users would like the ability to return material  purchased through the PROS program, for any reason, within 90 days of  receipt.  This does not include requirements submitted for investigation under  the Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) process.  Foreign customer SDRs will be  processed through the standard SDR process.   SOURCES SOUGHT FOR THE PARTS AND REPAIR ORDERING SYSTEM III (PROS III)  ACQUISITION EFFORT To:  All Prospective Offerors					6 August 2004 Subject:  Solicitation FA8630-04-R-5063, Sources Sought Parts and Repair  Ordering System III (PROS III)  1.  INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), as the  interface between the United States Department of Defense (DoD) logistics  systems and Security Assistance (SA) customers, is responsible for providing  comprehensive logistic support.  This interface includes fulfilling the  requirements of all Foreign Military Sales (FMS) countries that own and  operate  weapon systems of U.S. origin.  AFSAC+s mission is to recognize the  individualized needs of each FMS country, and develop support options that are  cost effective, timely and efficient for our FMS customers and the DoD.  Weapon systems and military material items sold by the DoD are supported by  AFSAC.  Comprehensive logistical support for FMS customers creates some unique  challenges.  Many FMS items are not of a type or configuration currently  active  in DoD’s inventories.  These items or requirements are considered to be non- standard. Many FMS supply requirements for older or customer unique material do not have  management data available. Some supply items may not have been catalogued due  to low or infrequent usage. Low quantities or dollar value requested may not  justify the administrative cost and time required to support a non-standard  supply requirement.  In other cases, when item management responsibilities do  exist, high DoD demand may take precedence over FMS supply requirements for  limited resources.  The result is unacceptably slow and unreliable support to  the FMS customer. Frequently, neither the organic capability nor the contractual supportability  exists within the DoD for maintenance of non-standard material.  The FMS  customer must contract direct commercial or do without support.  Some  customers  have set up procurement offices in the United States to alleviate these  difficulties; however, most do not have the resources or volume of business to  justify this option.  Non-standard items are those that are no longer, or have never been, actively  managed within the DoD logistics systems.  These also include Commercial Off- The-Shelf (COTS) items, and those standard items that the Military Departments  (MILDEPs) have deemed to be unobtainable within a reasonable time period.  The  difficulties in supporting these FMS requirements are being addressed through  ongoing Parts + Repair Ordering System II (PROS II) contract that is valid  through 4 December 2005.  The PROS III program is a follow-on effort to PROS II intended to fill the gap  in logistical support, and will allow additional options for maintaining DoD  support to our FMS customers.  By contracting out these specialized functions,  the requirement for DoD manpower is reduced, and the FMS customer receives  more  efficient support. 2.  Contract Effort Description: The PROS Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items,  maintenance services and the management of task orders.  The contract is  managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s  performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide “one stop shopping” for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 – Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material  (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is  not  a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for  supply  action usually due to inability to meet an established need date.  However,  the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD  approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.             Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being  maintenance and task orders. This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service.  The majority of  the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair  service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service.  The successful bidder  for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of  the  contract.  The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized)  sources  of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for  specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and award  fee  incentives. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy  Reports  (SDRs).  This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year  after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have  been completed several years before.  The successful bidder shall be advised  to  make arrangements to address this potential liability.  NOTE: The Supply  Discrepancy Report (SDR) process has been problematic in the previous and  current contract. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and  responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on  structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract amount is pass through costs for  procuring required parts and services.  Desirable Features Desire competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with  OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings – best available price – minimizing participation fees Turn around time – shortest possible lead-time – lead-time from after receipt  of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of  contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.

<DESC>The USDA Forest Service intends to make multiple awards for a five year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for bridge designs, inspections, and ratings; lookout tower inspections; ski lift design reviews and technical assistance; and other related engineering work in the States of Oregon and Washington.  Award of the contract will be made to as many as six of the most qualified firms.  It is anticipated that not all firms will be qualified in all disciplines.  Firms are encouraged to tailor the SF 330, Parts 1 and 2 to only that work in which the firm specializes.  Awardees will be given the opportunity to update their SF 330s annually.  These updates, as well as the record of the previous year’s performance, will be considered in the selection process.  Along with this, before each delivery order is issued, the Government will evaluate the awardees in relation to the nature and location of the project and select a firm for negotiations.

Interested firms should submit an SF 330, Parts 1 and 2, to Yvonne Sterud, Contracting Officer, Gifford Pinchot National Forest, 10600 NE 51st Circle, Vancouver, WA  98682.  Contractual and Proposal submission questions should be addressed to Yvonne Sterud at (360) 891-5082.  Technical questions should be addressed to the Pacific Northwest Regional Bridge Engineer, Merv Eriksson at (503) 808-2230.   The SF 330 which replaces the 254 and 255 is available for download from the Gifford Pinchot website. http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/

Minimum guarantee is $5,000 for each firm over the life of the contract.  Maximum order limitation is $100,000, per delivery order.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems Project Management Office (UAVS PMO) seeks to acquire and field an existing Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (SUAV) system that provides the best overall value to meet the small unit need for real-time recon naissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) and battle damage assessment (BDA).  The system shall have the flexibility to be modified through a Block Upgrade approach to achieve time-phased incorporation of the requirements within the Operationa l Requirements Document (ORD).  The governments objective for Block 0 is for the contractors to demonstrate their existing systems capabilities during a System Capability Demonstration (SCD).  At a minimum, the Block 0 system is required to meet the SUAV  screening criteria, Key Performance Parameters (KPPs), Airworthiness and Safety Requirements, and trade space requirements (optional).  The objective for Block 1a is the execution and delivery of LRIP systems and the corresponding program support.  The ob jective for Block 1b is the delivery of Full Rate Production (FRP) systems and corresponding program support.  The objective for Block II is for continued Spiral Development and Horizontal Technology Insertions. AMCOM plans to issue formal RFP Number W58RGZ-05-R-0382 for a full and open competition for the U.S. Army SUAV system on or about 28 February 2005 with proposals due on or about 11 April 2005.  The competition will be conducted in two phases, with the firs t phase resulting in contracts awarded to up to three offerors to demonstrate their system capabilities.  The second phase will result in a contract awarded to one offeror for the production and delivery of LRIP systems and the corresponding program suppor t, as well as for possible follow-on FRP systems.  The Phase I down-select will occur on or about 9 May 2005.  The Phase II/SCD will occur on or about 10 May  30 June 2005.  A best value approach will be used in source selection.

<RESPDATE>022205
<ARCHDATE>02042006
<CONTACT>Margaret Kirkpatrick Contract Specialist 9169785136     mkirkpatrick@mp.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The United States, Bureau of Reclamation, has a future requirement to perform construction work at Lauro Dam.  Lauro Dam and Reservoir are located on Diablo Creek, on the northern edge of the city of Santa Barbara, California.  The dam, which was constructed in 1952, is a zoned earthfill embankment with a structural height of 137 feet, a crest width of 30 feet and a crest length of 540 feet at elevation 567.5.  Lauro Reservoir is a regulating reservoir on the South Coast Conduit.  Inflow to the reservoir occurs via a turnout from the South Coast Conduit at a baffled drop structure located on the left side of the reservoir rim.  Its primary purpose is to meet the peak water demand for the City of Santa Barbara.  Lauro Dam is classified as a high-hazard facility due to the potential for downstream loss of life in the event of failure. The proposed construction work on Lauro Dam consists of a structural modification that incorporates a downstream filter and drain.  The work will require dewatering and excavation of the downstream face and toe of the dam, placement of layers of sand filter and gravel drain materials over the core material within the excavated area where an existing foundation fault exists.  Original embankment material will be placed over the drain materials, resulting in a significant portion of the crest and downstream face of the dam being wider than the original configuration.  The work will require the contractor to excavate at the toe or downstream portion of the dam with an active reservoir (reservoir elevation will not be lowered for construction).

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541720  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  This Sources Sought is in support of market research being conducted by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) to identify capable potential sources interested in providing services for the "Heed the Speed Study".  

NHTSA estimates that one in three traffic related fatalities are associated with speeding.  The purpose of this study is to determine the crash safety benefits for pedestrians when education and enforcement are employed alone and in the presence of engineering (roadway) changes. A recently published survey regarding speeding indicated that drivers believe speeding is more dangerous on residential streets as compared to other roadways. Preliminary findings from a recently completed pilot study implemented in Peoria, IL, and Phoenix, AZ; found that education when combined with enforcement reduced speeding in local neighborhoods and in addition, enhanced the effects of traffic calmed streets. However, the limited nature of this study did not permit an examination of the program effects on pedestrian safety.   

NHTSA is seeking sources to provide services for the NHTSA Heed the Speed Study. During this 36-month demonstration, the contractor shall develop site selection criteria (including speed related crashes), identify promising cities. Coordinate with public and private officials. Identify streets/ sites within one or more neighborhoods and make final selection recommendations. Prepare for and implement field test in one city, conduct data analysis, prepare final technical report and disseminate document.    

The estimated period of performance for this acquisition will be thirty-six  (36) months after the effective date of the contract.  The Government will use the information gathered from this Sources Sought to determine competition reservations and to develop the bidders list. The Government is seeking small businesses, if no eligible small businesses are found the Government intends to award this contract on a full and open basis.

Corporate Capabilities Needed for the Heed the Speed Pedestrian Demonstration and Evaluation Safety Program:

This project will require a contractor with the following experience and expertise:

·	Proven and demonstrated ability to plan for, implement and evaluate a comprehensive demonstration and (crash) evaluation study in the area of pedestrian safety;
·	Knowledge of NHTSA’s and FHWA’s pedestrian safety research; 
·	Knowledge of NHTSA’s and FHWA’s research on speeding and traffic safety;
·	Knowledge of NHTSA’s law enforcement research on traffic safety;
·	Credentialed staff having an educational background combining human factors research, with traffic enforcement experience and engineering expertise;
·	Proven and demonstrated success in obtaining cooperation from city officials and in conducting field research at the city level;
·	Proven and demonstrated capability in designing, implementing and evaluating a traffic safety program using statistical techniques to analyze the resultant data;
·	Proven and demonstrated success in preparing technical reports for both a general and technical audience; and,
·	Available resumes indicating expertise in the above areas. 

This project will not be simple to undertake.  It will be especially difficult for any contractor to obtain a sufficient sample size of pedestrian crashes both before and after the pedestrian safety program is initiated and relate these crashes to changes in specific neighborhoods. Few if any contractors possess both engineering and human factors capabilities and have worked seamlessly together.

All submitted information should be limited to no more than 10 pages, one-sided, minimum font size 10 and should be sent to Lamont O. Norwood, Small Business Specialist, via e-mail at lamont.norwood@nhtsa.dot.gov <mailto:lamont.norwood@nhtsa.dot.gov> by 14 February 2005 no later than 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time. A responder may request clarification in writing for any requirement that is unclear from Lamont O. Norwood, Small Business Specialist, at (202) 366-8573 or by sending an e-mail to  lamont.norwood@nhtsa.dot.gov <mailto:lamont.norwood@nhtsa.dot.gov>. Any requests for clarification must be received no later than three (3) business days prior to the close of this sources sought announcement in order to receive a timely response. 

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All routine communications regarding this announcement should be directed to Lamont O.Norwood. All responsible sources may submit information that shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR COMMENT/SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE No. SS-NCI-ESS-2005

Title:  "Development of a Common Biospecimen Coordination System and Informatics Infrastructure for NCI Prostate Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPOREs)"

This Request for Comment (RFC)/Source Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The purpose of this RFC/SS is to identify two (2) or more qualified small businesses including 8(a), HUBzone, and service disabled small disadvantaged businesses that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.  As a result of this RFC/SS, the NCI may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP). However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this RFC/SS or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement. 

Request for Comment: 
The National Cancer Institute seeks qualified small business contractors capable of developing a design plan and implementing a common biospecimen coordination system and informatics infrastructure (a "Biospecimen Coordination System") for multiple NCI Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPOREs) in prostate cancer research. This system shall facilitate biospecimen and data sharing among scientific investigators located at different institutions by employing standardized approaches for collecting, processing, storing, annotating and distributing high-quality biospecimens. Initially, this system shall support the Inter-SPORE Prostate Biomarkers Study (IPBS), a validation study of prospective prostate cancer biomarkers. Ultimately, the purpose of this project is to serve as a pilot for the National Biospecimen Network (NBN) by developing an infrastructure to annotate and integrate specimen banks, such as those of the SPOREs, to enhance the quality and availability of various biospecimens and associated data for the broader scientific community. If the pilot project is successful, then the government intends to use the Biospecimen Coordination System developed by the Contractor for other NCI and government projects. Future acquisitions to use, modify and/or update the Biospecimen Coordination System for other government projects will be awarded on a competitive basis.

The Biospecimen Coordination System informatics infrastructure shall promote communication and the exchange of biospecimens and data between participating centers, shall be fully compatible with the NCI's Cancer Bioinformatics Grid (caBIG) (http://cabig.nci.nih.gov/), and will directly employ caBIG tools wherever possible. Therefore, in addition to serving as a pilot for the NBN, the IPBS infrastructure will provide the Prostate SPOREs with an integrated, scalable informatics system that may serve as a model for other biorepository networks. The Biospecimen Coordination System is not intended to supplant existing resources at the participating SPORE sites, and will integrate with relevant clinical departments (e.g., surgery and pathology) without interrupting existing workflows. 

Capability statements shall include: (1) an outline of similar projects and other written statements to allow the NCI to perform a proper evaluation of the capability of prospective Offerors; and (2) detailed information on the Offeror's contract(s)/project(s) similar in nature to the this synopsis and draft statement of work documenting at least two (2) consecutive years of experience of the Project Director and the Offeror's company/institution in managing, running, and overseeing a multi-institutional human biorepository network within the past five years.  Contract(s)/project(s) listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of state or local governments, and commercial concerns. The following information should be submitted to document this experience:  Name of contracting organization; Contract number (for subcontracts, provide the prime contract number and the subcontract number); Contract type; Total contract value; Description of the requirement; Contracting Officer's name and telephone number; Project Director's name and telephone number; and Standard Industrial Code or NAICS code.  The Project Director shall be an employee of the Offeror and not a consultant or part of subcontractor staff, and must have a Master's degree or higher.

Capability statements shall also address the following major components of the Biospecimen Coordination System: (1) human subjects protection, privacy protection and informed consent processes; (2) rigorous standard operating procedures for biospecimen collection, processing, annotation, storage and dissemination; (3) quality assurance/quality control; (4) integration with associated clinical data, both retrospectively and prospectively; (5) informatics system requirements; (6) biospecimen and data access policies; (7) biohazard considerations and packing, shipping and storage policies; (8) intellectual property/ongoing system oversight and maintenance; (9) establishment of a common repository for biospecimens unused by the IPBS; and (10) personnel management. 

Because the Biospecimen Coordination System is envisioned as an ongoing resource with broad applicability to the scientific community, the Contractor shall establish a common biorepository of material not required for the IPBS. Access to this common biorepository will be overseen by a subcommittee of the project Governance Board. Prostate SPORE programs may store some biospecimens locally; however, each participating SPORE program will ship a subset of samples (rigorously collected and annotated based on Standard Operating Procedures) to the common repository managed by the Contractor. 

This project will consist of two phases. Phase 1 focuses on developing a recommended design plan and budget for system implementation. The Phase 1 design plan shall also describe at least two other viable options and alternatives (including budgets) for implementing the pilot system.  Phase 2 is the implementation of the Phase 1 design plan as a pilot system for the Prostate SPOREs, and will be contingent upon review and approval of the Phase 1 design plan and budget by an NCI-convened expert committee.  The Phase 1 design plan including alternatives with budgets will be due within three (3) months of the Contract award. 

The expert review committee may accept the Phase 1 recommended design plan, reject the Phase 1 design plan, or suggest changes based on the options and alternatives stated in the design plan. Therefore, Phase 2 is an option to be exercised at the discretion of the Government. An important charge of the expert review committee will be to determine the appropriate human subject provisions for Phase 2 based on the Phase 1 design plan. Phase 2 shall incorporate all required human subjects requirements before Phase 2 implementation based on the recommendations of the expert review committee. Upon approval of the Phase 1 design plan and exercising of Phase 2, complete system implementation shall be achieved within twenty (20) months.

<SUBJECT>B--Intent to award single source award to Oregon State University for Genetic ID of putative spring run juvenile Chinook salmon from Clear and Battle Creek, upper Sacramento River, California
<DESC>Intent to award single source award to Oregon State University for Genetic ID of putative spring run juvenile Chinook salmon from Clear and Battle Creek, upper Sacramento River, California.  Genetic analysis techniques used to identify the spring-run Chinook life history type have only recently become available for the upper Sacramento River and its tributaries.  These techniques were developed by Dr. Michael A. Banks, a Marine Fisheries Geneticist and Assistant Professor in the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Oregon State University.  Dr Banks has worked on many projects to distinguish the runs of Chinook in the Central Valley including an ongoing study funded by the Department of Water Resources (DWR).  Dr. Banks is currently the only researcher capable of performing the genetic analysis (Task 1) with the markers developed by his lab.  In addition Dr Banks is the only researcher capable of performing the assessment of relationships (Task 2) because the goal of this project is linked to Dr Banks ongoing DWR study.  The goal of this project is to assess the genetic relationship of juvenile Chinook from Clear Creek and Battle Creek to those from other Central Valley streams, which is only possible by integrating the assessment with findings from the DWR study.   Estimated award date 2/15/2005.  Respond by 2/14/2005.

<SUBJECT>T -- Intent to Sole Source
<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management intends to issue a sole-source firm-fixed price two-year (base year and one option year) blanket purchase agreement (BPA) to OmniStudio, for design and graphic services in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1); FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This requirement will be awarded to small business.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 541430.  The size threshold for determining whether or not an offeror is a small is a company with gross annual sales over the past three years not exceeding $6 million.

The Contractor is required to provide design and graphic services the for following items:  Reports and Report Covers, Folders, Posters, Note Cards, Press Releases, Handouts, Invitations, Brochures/pamphlets, Programs, Banners, Power Point templates/presentations, Tent Cards, and I.D Badges. The designs must incorporate the current OPM branding using the OPM branding rectangle (including American flag, the color seal of OPM, and the “Working for America” slogan (in Schooner Script font) and other images (a good example of is the look and texture designed in the OPM 2002 edition of its Strategic Plan (available from the Publications Management Group upon request.  Design must be developed in Adobe InDesign.  Design must work well with whatever printing process is employed and not cause production problems which will increase the cost and time of production when printed.
We will require submission of a minimum of three (3) design concepts within 3 -5 working days of the placement of an order.  Once the design has been selected the contractor must submit complete designs, printed material, and electronic files for all products within 1 – 3 weeks.

Omnistudio is the only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements due to the following reasons: 
1.	OmniStudio provides expert design and graphic services.  The president of OmniStudio and her staff are intimately familiar with our product concept and design features.  Having produced many documents for us in the past, they possess our historical text and image files which are instrumental in producing acceptable products.  They have met our required production schedules which had no room for slippage due to the delivery dates required by law. 
2.	With the exception of small jobs provided to small business, OmniStudio has designed our previous products.  Their familiarity with our publications and the limited timeframes for production and publishing provides us the assurance of knowing our publications will be distributed in a timely manner without any disruptions and/or delays, saving the Government both time and money, and meeting the delivery dates required by law.  
3.	OmniStudio has a demonstrated capability and willingness to accomplish near impossible tasks with little or no notice.  Since our publication’s delivery dates are mandated by law, failure to meet these dates would reflect poorly on us and in some cases could potentially reduce our President’s Management Agenda (PMA) ranking. 
4.	The issuance of the BPA to OmniStudio will ensure that we remain in compliance with rules and regulations governing the distribution of our publications.  However, we will continue to acquire services from other small businesses to provide us with design and graphic services for our publication requirements that aren’t as time critical and/or high sensitive in nature in an effort to expose them more fully to our requirements.  

Interested parties are reminded that information furnished under this solicitation may be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Therefore, items that are confidential to businesses, or contain trade secrets, proprietary, or personnel information must be clearly marked.  Marking of items will not necessarily preclude disclosure when the OPM or the Government determines disclosure when warranted by FOIA.  However, if such items are not marked, all information contained within the submitted documents will be deemed to be releasable.  

This in no way obligates the Government to award a sole-source BPA. This is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet this requirement are invited to submit a statement of capability with pricing information, within 15 days of publication of this notice. The Government will not pay for any information provided.  Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.  Interested parties are requested to contact Toni Campbell at Antoinette.Campbell@opm.gov or by fax 202 606-1464

<DESC>The U.S. EPA, National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Mercury Technology Services under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 for a modification under existing Contract 68-C-02-088 to conduct the final phase of a three phase study to determine the mercury content of the U.S. petroleum supply. Under the contract, the contractor is required to perform the following tasks: (1) Produce a Quality Assurance Project Plan, (2) Obtain crude oil samples and supporting information needed to perform statistical analysis, (3) Construct a sampling plan that will provide a statistically acceptable mean and standard deviation of the mercury concentation in the U.S. oil supply, (4) Analyze samples, (5) Distribute samples as required and maintain chain of custody records, (6) Schedule sampling to occur such that aging does not become a factor and identify samples for which mercury speciation is required, (7) Receive, assemble and statistically analyze the data to determine the mean, standard deviation, and confidence level, and (8) provide monthly reports and a final report or peer-reviewed journal article. Under the proposed modification, the contractor shall obtain and analyze an additional 215 samples. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. EPA source research indicates Mercury Technology Services is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement. The work to be performed requires: extensive contacts throughout the petroleum industry; in-depth knowledge of the pollutant chemistries of the gas and oil industry with an emphasis on the chemistry of mercury; the ability to model the fate of various mercury speicies in the gas and oil processing industries; and in-depth knowledge of mercury cleanup and mercury control technologies available to the gas and oil industries. Mercury Technology Services conducted the first two phases of the study and is thoroughly familiar with the project. Its personnel are the only ones known with the required combination of knowledge, experience, abilities, and established relationships needed to complete the final phase of this study. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the statement of work. Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice. A determination not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis for the proposed contract modification. This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 15, Contracting By Negotiation. The applicable NAICS code is 541620. The anticipated effctive date for the modification is 3/1/05.

<DESC>Maintain operability of current internet/extranet portal architecture, 48FW.Com.  Questions regarding this solicitation or for a copy of the SOW and synopsis/solicitation, please send request to meagan.fyffe@lakenheath.af.mil or joseph.warren@lakenheath.af.mil.  

Questions and Answers:  48FW.Com	Updated 4 Feb 2005
Q:   What, if any, work permit is required for consultants onsite at the base?  
A:  The customer will work with KTR to obtain base entry passes/sponsor on base etc.    

Q:   Is there any idea to the scope of the upgrades?  Have applications been earmarked for integration?
A:   We know service packs will come out for the software, but we don’t know when or what they will contain (Microsoft product). The consultant will have to make sure that when we install those, the system stays up and running. Our servers will also be upgraded, but the Comm Squadron will take care of the hardware. We do not currently have any applications to integrate except for Live Communications Server, and our SOW already says that the contractor will be responsible for the planning and development of that system. Most other applications that are necessary are already integrated, though it is not possible to anticipate all future needs.

Q:   Req. 3.2 seems to conflict Req. 1.1 is 25 hours the minimum required onsite time?
A:  25 hours will be the minimum required time of work per week, within the prescribed duty hours, onsite.

Q:    What are the current development processes?  Is there a content management system in place?  Are there standard change control procedures in place?
A:  Currently we have a stable system that needs to be maintained, with the exception of LCS. There are standards of practice and methods/systems to manage content, but as this is a new system, this is evolving and open to suggestion/support. There are also systems inherent in the Sharepoint software. We do not have standard change control procedures that the contractor must directly be involved in. Changes that need to be made will be taken through the proper avenues and enacted as appropriate. Obviously if a change will cause negative effects to our or another system, then we will not support it. 

Questions and Answers:  48FW.Com 			As of 28 January 2005

Q:  Do you know of similar type projects of this length of time and what the costs were? 
A:  We are the only Base in USAFE doing this but Langley and Hawaii 

Q:  Is there currently a SharePoint Portal solution in place? 
A:  Yes the severs have all been built and the site is up and running.  
 If so, what is the current Intranet / Extranet architecture  Currently we are running Sharepoint 2003 in a medium Sever farm architecture. But looking to grow to a large server farm with LCS
 Can you or the customer provide me diagrams of the current solution?   Cannot disclose network architecture.. Just that we have built off of the Microsoft whitepapers Med server farm with a Microsoft consultant.

Q:  Have hardware and software licenses been purchased? 
A:  Yes most of them except 2 SQL licenses which will be purchased by March 

Q:  What is the purpose of the portal; what are they currently using the Intranet/Extranet for; what is it they hope to be able to do with SharePoint Portal 2003 and LCS?
A:  We are currently using it to provide all normal base information on a intranet/extranet plus the capability of accessing our ESN drives (team sites) and we are using our mysites as collaboration areas.. LCS will be used on base only not through the extranet 

Q:  SharePoint can be extended extensively, how much integration do they want to do with other applications (other than LCS)?  
A:  Right now we are just looking to integrate LCS, K2 and Merido are not on our scope at all 
The hired contractor/s  will be working with our 3 person team. The portal has been developed and we are looking now more to sustainment and upgrading capabilities within SharePoint. LCS integration is still/was suppose to be advertised as a future capability and only if it is approved at MAJCOM.

Q:  What about Back up and anti-virus solutions, and I would like to know what vendor/software packages are being used as well as versions and support. 
A:  We're working on a backup solution with the NOSC at USAFE.  The contractor will need to be familiar with our solution, but will not need to manage it or be responsible for it. We use Comvault.

Q:  The ammended SOW asks for 25 hours/week.  Is that a total of 50 hours for two people or just 25 hours for one? 
A:  We need someone on site for 25 hours a week.  They can send 2 people here if they need to, but we only need those 25 hours covered.

<DESC>Answers to questions received For #1 - should we provide the Interface Requirement Spec - Spec is available upon request. 1. The initial integration will consist of a DMLSS PR inbound to PD2 and a contract award outbound to DMLSS. The PR and Award will be created in XML and are expected conform to existing PD2 DTDs.  This will be confirmed during the requirements identification phase of the project. 2. These two transactions represent the initial transaction set for this integration. It is anticipated that additional transactions will be required in the future and that these will require the application of unique business rules to ensure correct processing. These initial transactions are being designed with a translator to ensure consistency in the current and future design of this integration.  In addition - the use of the ETI Solution tool is required for documenting requirements as well as for required development. 3. The contractor will be expected to host and use the JPMO's licensed copy of the ETI Solution Toolset to complete this integration. 4. Incoming PRs will be received from and outgoing Awards will be routed through the DAASC DEBX. DAASC POC is Stuart Scott, sscott@daas.dla.mil, 937-656-3705.  QUESTIONS: 1.  Based on Conference Calls that XXXXXXXX participated in with DMLLS, it's our understanding that DMLSS provides PRs in an XML file that conforms to the PD2 xProcurement and xCommon DTDs that define the PD2 Adapter Standards. In addition, it's our understanding that DMLLS can accept Awards in an XML format conforming to the PD2 Adapter DTDs.  Please confirm this. 2.  If Number 1 is confirmed, please clarify the need for a translator as referenced in the SOW.  If DMLSS and PD2 generate and accept XML files conforming to the PD2 Adapter DTDs, there is no requirement for a translator since the file formats are the same. 3.  If a translator is required for this effort, the SOW requires the translator to be built using the ETI Solution Version 5 Toolset.  In addition, the SOW requires delivery of the ETI Solution Metastore upon project completion.  The JPMO currently has a leased version of the ETI Solution Version 5 Toolset and a Metastore that contains data related to the existing integrations utilizing the ETI Solution Version 5 Toolset.  Therefore, it seems likely that the JPMO will allow the contractor awarded this effort to utilize the JPMO leased version of the ETI Solution Version 5 Toolset to ensure that information for this integration is contained with the JPMO's existing Metastore.  Please clarify if the JPMO leased version of the ETI Solution Version 5 Toolset can be utilized by the contractor awarded this project. 4.  Based on Conference Calls that XXXXXX participated in with DMLLS, it's our understanding that the DAASC-DEBX supports this integration by routing files between PD2 and DMLLS.  Please confirm that DAASC-DEBX has a role in this integration.  In addition, if available, please provide a DAASC-DEBX POC that XXXXXX can work with to determine the technical architecture or options for a technical solution to support this integration effort. The DMLSS Interface Requirements Spec is available upon request.  Please contact the PCO via e-mail for a copy.
