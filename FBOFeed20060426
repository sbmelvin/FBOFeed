<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE
HSCG40-06-Q-41029


This acquisition is subject to Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The Solicitation, Evaluation, and Award procedures of FAR Parts 13.106-1, 13.106-2, and 13.106-3 apply. 

The Coast Guard Engineering Logistics center intends to procure TWO Crankshafts (used on the PAXMAN 16RP200M Engine). NSN: 2815-99-810-6101. This acquisition is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with contractors who can provide CERTIFIED AUTHENTIC OEM Parts.

This will be other than full and open competition using OEM Man B&W Diesel. Technical data and/or drawings pertaining to Man B&W Diesel parts are not available to the Government and are propriety to the OEM. Accordingly, it is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center from obtaining competition, as they are available from one source. However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to supply the parts for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The procurement involves parts being procured from the prime equipment manufacturer of its actual supplier.  Organizations having the expertise and required capabilities to provide the items are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities as follows: (i.e. salient physical functional and serviceability characteristics) (1) show that they satisfactorily manufactured the parts for the Government or primary equipment manufacturer; or (2) submit complete and current engineering data comparing the offered parts to the OEM to demonstrate the acceptability of the parts The submission of technical data packages for review shall not impede the award.  It is the government’s belief that only Man B&W Diesel., the manufacturer of the crankshafts and/or its authorized dealers and distributors can furnish the required parts and ensure the proper fit, form and function of all its components. The United States Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center does not possess the technical expertise to evaluate the parts of an alternate product. Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussion capabilities in duplicate within fifteen (15) days of this announcement. No cost or pricing information is required. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government does not intend to pay for this information solicited. Responses must be concise and be specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above. Concerns that respond to the notice must fully demonstrate their capabilities to meet the requirements. Adequate detailed data by which to evaluate capabilities should be sent to the attention of Samantha Watts Purchasing Agent (CODE 044).  

A solicitation will be release on or about April 27th, 2006.

<DESC>Architect-engineering (A-E) services are required for a range of engineering services and other consulting services in connection with the development, assessment, monitoring, and evaluation of infrastructure projects in developing countries to be funded by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC).  

Questions regarding this solicitation should  be submitted   NO LATER THAN 4:00 P.M. NOVEMBER 14, 2005, addressed to either Paulette Roseboro, Senior Contract Specialist or Ms. Sinnammal Souppaya, Contracting Officer, e-mail: Infrastructure@mcc.gov      subject line should state: A-E Services 

1. 	Contract Information

This contract is being procured in accordance with Brooks Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  Firms will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  Multiple Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards are anticipated for specific infrastructure sub-sector(s) and competency areas(s) (see Project Information below), each with a base year and four one-year options.  The government may exercise option periods unilaterally.  

The value and ceiling of each contract will be determined based on the sub-sector(s) and competency area(s).  The maximum value of task orders issued will not exceed $20 million each year.  The minimum guarantee for each contract shall be $2,500 for each year.  Work will be issued by negotiated firm fixed price or time and materials task orders.  

 Performance will be authorized through the competitive award of individual task orders each of which will have a specific period of performance.  Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates.    It is anticipated that the initial task order will be awarded competitively in February 2006.

While, in most cases, task orders will be issued pursuant to a competitive process, giving qualified firms a fair opportunity to compete, MCC reserves the right, based on the competition initially received under the basic contract awards, to award task orders on a sole source basis.
  
The work requirements may require performance of services at contractor facilities, at the offices of MCC in Washington, DC and in foreign countries.   The contractor is generally expected to make all logistical arrangements (hotels, visa services, translation and interpretation, local support and transportation).   

North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330, which has a design standard of $4,000,000 in average annual receipts.

It should also be noted that MCC is required to administer a small business program.  To this end, MCC seeks, to the maximum extent possible, to include highly qualified small and disadvantaged business firms in the basic contract awards and, as available, in subcontract opportunities under task orders issued.   Interested parties are reminded that the successful firm(s) will be expected to place subcontracts, to the maximum extent possible, with small and disadvantaged firms in accordance with Public Law 95-507.  Small and disadvantaged firms are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses.  Any large businesses firm selected must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for submission of subcontracting plans.  In your response to this notice clearly identify your business size and, if applicable, your firm’s socio-economic status.

When work is identified, following award of IDIQ contracts, task order specific selection criteria will be provided to the contractors to supplement their SF330s.  The SF330s and supplements will be used to determine the most highly qualified firms.  

Successful firms are advised that they will not be eligible for award of a contract (funded out of the proceeds of a Compact) to implement a specific infrastructure project for which they provided development, assessment, evaluation or monitoring services to MCC or the eligible country hereunder.

To be eligible for award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov.


2. 	Project Information

INTERESTED PARTIES ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE DETAILED STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) ATTACHED TO THIS NOTICE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

MCC is engaging with a number of countries designated as eligible to apply for MCC assistance and, eventually, will enter into an agreement (Compact) for assistance with countries that submit quality proposals that support economic growth.  Countries identify their own highest priorities for achieving sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction and the MCC makes a determination of funding based on its evaluation of the merits of proposed projects and programs.  Proposals developed by countries may include requests for funding of infrastructure projects, for example, in one or more of the following sectors:

1.	Transport – highways, roads and bridges, ports, rail and airports 
2.	Water Resources, Water and Sanitation – management and development of hydro resources, rural and urban water supply and sanitation systems 
3.	Energy – resource development, electric generation (conventional or alternative energy), transmission and distribution, rural electrification, gas supply and distribution, oil and gas  exploration and production   
4.	Industrial and institutional facilities – industrial parks and agricultural processing zones; institutional facilities such as schools, hospitals, etc. 
5.	Telecom and Information Communication Technology (ICT) – telecommunications infrastructure
		
	Contractors with skills and experience in any of the above sectors may submit offers, and should indicate those sectors in which they possess appropriate skills and substantiate their qualifications.  Proposals should be inclusive of all sectors for which they wish to be considered.  

2.2 Geographic Areas and Eligible Countries

For purposes of this action, it may be assumed that MCC will be dealing with approximately 20 countries and that many of the countries will be considering multiple infrastructure projects.  Please see the MCC website (www.mcc.gov) for a list of eligible countries.  Additional eligible countries will be announced by the MCC Board of Directors in November 2005 and annually thereafter.

2.3 Competency Areas

Beginning with the proposal stage, MCC will need to assess, among other things, the technical feasibility, engineering soundness, environmental impacts, institutional aspects, economic viability and regulatory framework, financial and economic viability, and sustainability of proposed projects.  Once a project has been approved for funding under the Compact, there will be a continuing need to monitor project progress during the construction phase and, in some cases, to evaluate project performance and impacts during the operational phase.     

Contractors shall provide consulting, advisory, assessment, monitoring and evaluation services in the areas of program and project development, independent engineering, financial and economic analysis and environmental and social assessment in response to long-term and short-term task assignments.   Experience with design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of infrastructure projects is required, and overseas experience in developing countries is highly desirable.  Knowledge of foreign languages is highly desirable (especially French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian and Arabic) but not required.  Specific assignments within each task include, but are not limited to, the following competency areas:

Competency Area I: Project development

Once countries have submitted a proposal for MCC funding, MCC and the country may decide that additional program development activities are required.  Such activities may include project feasibility studies, baseline studies, and environmental evaluations.  The countries may require additional assistance in managing and executing these activities.  Assistance to countries may include:

•	Consulting services involving project development and implementation
•	Integration of projects into comprehensive program of economic development assistance
•	Review and assessment of capacity to implement projects and program.

Competency Area II: Assessing project feasibility and engineering 

The contractor shall conduct an assessment of the proposed project from the perspective of an Independent Engineer representing MCC.  The assessment will cover a variety of elements that will be further identified by the MCC but will generally include:

•	Review of project concept and feasibility
•	Assessment of appropriateness of chosen technology and application, including constructability and value engineering
•	Assessment of design and engineering projects
•	Analysis of project timeline and schedule
•	Analysis of project technical risks
•	Analysis of project plans, specifications, and cost estimates
•	Analysis of operational capacity
•	Assessment of maintenance requirements
•	Review and development of Master Plans

Competency Area III:  Assessing environmental and social impacts

The legislation that created MCC mandates that no assistance may be provided for any project that is likely to cause a significant environmental, health or safety hazard.  With that in mind, the contractor shall review environmental and social impact assessments of projects under consideration on behalf of the MCC.   

The contractor shall conduct a technical review of environmental and social assessment work related to potential projects from the perspective of an Independent Engineer representing the funding entity, i.e., MCC.  This review will cover a variety of elements that will be further identified by the MCC but will generally include:

•	Analysis of overall quality of environmental assessment work and consistency with MCC environmental guidelines
•	Initial environmental examination based on MCC environmental guidelines
•	Integration of environmental and social assessment work, to include identification of alternatives, as appropriate, and/or impact mitigation measures, with economic, financial, institutional, social, and technical analyses of proposed activity
•	Analysis of scope of existing environmental and social assessment work
•	Assessment of need for further environmental work
•	Analysis of extent, appropriateness, technical feasibility, and cost of implementing alternatives, remediation and/or mitigation measures
•	Analysis of the extent, appropriateness, technical feasibility and cost of managing the environmental and social impacts of the project
•	Analysis of project implementing entity capabilities related to managing environmental and social impacts of the project
•	Analysis of consistency of country guidelines and project-relevant international conventions to which they are signatory and of consistency of country guidelines with MCC environmental guidelines
•	Analysis of extent and quality of public consultation in environmental and social assessment work
•	Analysis of overall quality, scope, extent, appropriateness, technical feasibility and cost of remediation and/or mitigation measures, capabilities of project implementing entities and extent and quality of public consultation related to social assessment, resettlement, and cultural property.

Competency Area IV: Assessing project economics  

The contractor shall develop a financial and an economic assessment of the proposed project.  MCC is concerned with the reasonableness of the underlying projects economics and the long-term sustainability.  Financial and economic assessments that called for by MCC will generally include estimation (or validation) of the following:

•	Buildup of project costs and underlying assumptions
•	Quantification of benefits and calculation of economic rates of return
•	Calculation of financial rate of return
•	Sensitivity analysis on key variables and an assessment of risk and impacts
•	Analysis of recurrent costs, financial sustainability, tariffs, affordability, and other factors that determine project economics and sustainability  
•	Identification of beneficiaries and link to poverty reduction and economic growth
•	Identification of appropriate performance and outcome indicators, baseline data, and targets

Compentency Area V:  Assessing Institutional and Regulatory Environment

In order for infrastructure projects to be sustainable, it is necessary that a suitable institutional and regulatory framework is in place.  The contractor shall conduct a technical review of institutional and regulatory framework related to potential projects from the perspective of the funding entity, i.e., MCC.  This review will cover a variety of elements that will be further identified by the MCC but will generally include:

•	Institutional arrangements and organizational design
•	Regulatory framework
•	Market structure
•	Ownership structure (public/private) and potential changes to this structure
•	Tariff issues
•	Need for capacity building

Competency Area VI: Monitoring projects during funding period

Once projects have become operational, the contractor may be requested to conduct an in-country review of operations to provide assurance that the project is meeting expectations as regards performance standards and outputs.  In addition, the contractor may be requested to review impacts of the project on the local economy and environment.

<CONTACT>Jerry Riles, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-767-0667, Fax 202-767-6197, Email jerry.riles@nrl.navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) intends to negotiate a contract on the basis of Other Than Full and Open Competition IAW 10 USC 2304©(1), only one responsible source.  NRL will negotiate with Raytheon Company, Vision Systems, 75 Coromar Drive, Goleta, CA 93117. NRL is developing state-of-the-art short wave infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral sensor systems.  NRL previously procured four focal plane arrays in a competitive award with Raytheon Company. Two of these focal plane arrays will be incorporated into hyperspectral sensors and the required hyperspectral performance can be achieved only if the arrays are operated at lower cryogenic temperatures, thereby requiring cooling systems for two of the focal plane arrays.  The cooling system consists of an evacuated dewar container that contains the focal plane array and electrical connectors that transmit the electrical signals generated by the focal plane array outside of the dewar assembly. The contractor will provide a closed cycle Cryogenic Cooling system for a SWIR Focal Plane Array.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to South Bay Cable Corporation, P.O. Box 67, Idyllwild, CA 92549 for the acquisition of 1000 feet of tow cable for the MK-105 system.  The MK-105 Mod 4 Tow Cable consists of the following three major subassemblies; end fittings, exterior hose, and core.  NSWC PC as the In-Service Engineering Agent for the  MK-105 system was sent two tow cables for repair.  NSWC PC  has determined that both the end fittings and the exterior hose are usable but the core is non-repairable.  The core consists of electrical conductors, a Kevlar strength member, and protective jacketing.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  South Bay Cable is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the core.  All presently purchase Navy documentation  requires that the core be purchased from South Bay Cable.  Use of another core other than from South Bay Cable to repair the MK-105!  , would require extensive testing, qualification, and recertification of the tow cable.  Therefore, it is imperative that this cable is acquired from South Bay Cable.  NAICS code is 335929, FSC code is 5995, SBA size standard is 1,000 employees.

<DESC>THERE IS NO RFP PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.  ALL INFORMATION NEEDED TO SUBMIT STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, PARTS I AND II, IS CONTAINED HEREIN. This proposed contract is an unrestricted procurement.  Services include, but are not limited to the preparation of facilities and land use planning studies and documents of various types normally used by the U.S. Navy, and such technical services related to such documents and software as may be requested by the Department of the Navy, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific (NAVFAC Pacific) for projects and activities at various locations worldwide, with emphasis in the Pacific and Indian Ocean Areas.  The primary tasks anticipated for the Architect-Engineer (A-E) are the originating and the updating of planning studies and documents.  Additionally, the A E may be assigned ancillary work to edit and rework incomplete or preliminary planning documents into final completed products based on technical knowledge and skills gained by professional training and experience in the planning and maintenance of military and government facilities and installations.  Planning documents, as referred to herein, include but are not limited to any document relating to Master Plans, Capital Improvement Plans, Regional Shore Infrastructure Planning (RSIP) Overview and Functional Studies, Special Planning Studies, Air Installations Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ) Studies, Land Use Studies, Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Studies, Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection Studies, Military Training Studies, Space Studies (e.g., Administrative), Military Construction and Special Projects write-ups (normally on Department of Defense Standard Form 1391) with supporting documents (e.g., Cost Estimate, Site Plans, Floor Plans, NEPA documentation, etc.), Engineering Evaluations (EEs), Facilities Requirements Plans (FRP), Basic Facility Requirement (BFR) justifications, Facility Planning Documents (FPDs), Economic Analyses (EA), System Safety documents, Site Approval requests, Environmental Studies, Civil Engineering Support Plan, Land Inventory Analyses, studies, visual presentations, graphics, and/or any component or portion (not necessarily the entirety) of such documents.  Field verification survey work may also be an ancillary part of the planning process.  Any preparatory work, visual presentation, briefing, study, or report, which may be required prior to the initiation of any planning document listed, is also included under this contract scope.  Planning projects may include those for other U.S. Military Commands and Agencies (e.g., U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Coast Guard, and other U.S. Agencies) worldwide,  in addition to those of the U.S. Navy.  The A E shall also provide all professional services required for the completion of planning documents, including researching data, conducting site surveys, preparing, reviewing, and editing technical text and graphics to ensure completeness and correctness of documents.  When such services are required of the A E for projects not wholly assigned to the A E alone, the A E must exercise professional judgment to verify the correctness and validity of the information, and the results and conclusions of the material the A E is called upon to finalize.  The A E must analyze, coordinate, correlate, synthesize, correct, supplement, and finalize the work assigned.  As an example of such an assignment, if the A E is called upon to finalize the draft of a document or a particular graphic submitted by NAVFAC Pacific, the A E shall rework such document or graphic until, in the A E's judgment, the finished product is correct, complete, and reflective of the A E's professional judgment and standards.  The A-E shall provide electronic deliverables for the publication of planning documents and the integration of source data used or generated during the planning process into the data libraries of the Regional Shore Infrastructure Plan (RSIP-Link) information system.  The purpose of the RSIP-Link System is to disseminate Regional Overview Plans, Functional Plans, and Other Studies/Documents to customer Activities via the internet, to provide document management tools for programs such as the MCON and Special Projects programs, to provide a repository of references and interactive data libraries and to provide access to data spatially through a GIS interface.

<DESC>The Air to Ground Munitions System Wing (AGMSW) BLU-122 Systems Squadron under the Direct Attack Systems Group (AASG) intends to award a sole source action to General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems, 4565 Commercial Drive, Niceville, FL. 32578.  The proposed contract action is for the production of up to 300 BLU-122 Warheads for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1. Authorization to do so is contained under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but rather a notice of a contract action to renegotiate Production Lot 2 and Lot 3 of contract F08635-03-C-0025. This action is deemed necessary as the vast fluctuation of steel prices was not considered or anticipated at the time of contract award.  The Government has determined that a new competitive solicitation for this action would incur substantial duplication of costs in relation to technical and configuration knowledge of the warhead, which would not be recovered through competition, as well as the loss of critical uninterrupted production. The contractor for this action must be a qualified source and meet the Government Systems Requirement Document (SRD)/Performance Specification, as verified by having passed qualification tests and Government flight tests. Interested parties shall submit a capabilities package, which addresses all requirements listed in this announcement.  Forward qualification packages within 45 days of this notice to:  AGMSW/DASG-RU, Attn: Ms. Sallye Belton, Bldg 614, 110 Wacissa Road, Eglin, AFB FL  32542-6807.   For further information concerning technical aspects, contact Major Michael J. Lauden, (850) 882-9514 ext 2091 or e-mail michael.lauden@eglin.af.mil. For contractual information, contact Ms Lisa Younghanse, 850-882-9514 ext 3100, e-mail lisa.younghanse@eglin.af.mil or Sallye N. Belton, (850) 882-3525 ext 3070, e-mail sallye.belton@eglin.af.mil.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified above. The Ombudsman is Colonel Joseph A. Lanni, AAC/CV, at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5495; his phone number is (850) 882-0662.  Numbered Notes 22 and 26 apply.

<DESC>1.     The 12th Contracting Squadron, Randolph AFB TX, has a requirement for one (1) machining center for nonferrous metals/woods/plastics in accordance with the attached Statement of Work (SOW) and specifications.  The specifications are to be used as a guide only; however,  the machine must meet or exceed those specifications that are listed     This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and 13.5 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     This solicitation is issued as request for quotation (RFQ) number F3P3BD6031A100.     This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.  For small business set-asides other than construction or services, any concern proposing to furnish a product that it did not itself manufacture must furnish the product of a small business manufacturer.     The government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror submitting the quote that provides the best value to the government.     Award is contingent upon availability of funds. The associated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 333512; size standard 500 employees.

2.     The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, are applicable to this solicitation.     Interested parties may submit a written quote in accordance with FAR 52.212-1.     Oral quotes will not be accepted.     Your quote should include your Cage Code, DUNS, and Tax Identification numbers.     To be eligible to receive an award resulting from this RFQ, contractors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, no exceptions.     To register, please visit http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.     Contractors must complete the Representations and Certifications in the ORCA database at http://www.bpn.gov/orca.       

3.     FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.     Addendum:     Basis for Award:     This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPT) procedures.     For proposals determined technically acceptable, a tradeoff between price and past performance will be conducted with past performance being significantly more important than price.     Offers shall propose on all items.     Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated.     An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.     Quotes determined to be unreasonable or not compatible with the scope of effort or either excessive or insufficient for the effort to be accomplished will not be considered in the performance/price trade-off and will be ineligible for award. 

4.     The evaluation process will proceed as follows:     (a) Technical Acceptance:     By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all the terms, conditions, statement of work, and all other requirements of this solicitation and subsequent contract, and will be determined technically acceptable.     Any exception taken to the terms, conditions, or requirements will result in a determination of technical unacceptability; (b) Price:     Initially, all technically acceptable offers will be ranked according to price.     Reasonableness will be determined based on prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate and prior acquisitions, if applicable.     Realism will be based on an evaluation of prices to determine if they are compatible with the scope of effort, are not unbalanced, and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished    c) Past Performance:   Using questionnaires, the contracting officer will seek relevant and recent performance information on all technically acceptable offers based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Recency:     To be considered recent, a contract shall have been performed during the past three years from the date of issuance of this posting.     Relevancy:     Relevant performance includes performance of work efforts that is similar or greater in scope and magnitude.     The following varying degrees of relevancy apply to this solicitation: Very Relevant	Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Relevant Present/past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Somewhat Relevant Present/past performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.  Not Relevant Present/past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Offerors shall submit a minimum of 3 references, but no more than 5 overall of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers.     The offeror shall provide the attached past performance questionnaire to the reference and bear responsibility for ensuring that the reference provides the completed questionnaire to the point of contact identified in paragraph 11 of this posting by the deadline for offer submission.     Questionnaires submitted prior to the deadline for offer submission will be accepted.     The reference list should include, as a minimum: Contract Number, Description of Contract/Project Effort, Period of Performance, Contract Dollar Value, Name, Title, Current Address and Telephone Number of Contracting Officer and Quality Assurance Evaluator/Project Manager.
 
5.     The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this solicitation based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.     The agency will evaluate past performance in accordance with the criteria in paragraphs 4(c) through 8 of this solicitation.     The rating may be determined initially or as a result of discussions.     The confidence assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.     A trade-off process is then conducted.     The lowest price may not necessarily receive the award; likewise, the highest past performance rating may not necessarily receive the award.     A performance/price trade-off evaluation will not be conducted if only one acceptable offeror is received.     In this event, award will be made to the only technically acceptable quote received.     

6.     Overall confidence ratings are defined as follows: High Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has high confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Significant Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has significant confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable. Little Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     No Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

7.     Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant and recent experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement may not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.     Offerors with no relevant present or past performance history will receive a neutral rating, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.     However, a rating other than neutral may be assessed if the offeror proposes management personnel who have a record of performance on relevant contracts, or if a proposed subcontractor or partner who will be performing a significant portion of the work has a performance history on relevant contracts.     When relevant performance information indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised).     Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.     The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness.     The offeror may be notified of any adverse past performance information and given the opportunity to respond. 

8.     If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is determined to be reasonable and realistic, and is judged to have an overall high performance confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.     Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.     If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is not rated high confidence in the performance assessment, the next lowest priced, technically acceptable offer will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror whose price is reasonable and realistic is rated high confidence overall for past performance.     An integrated assessment will then be performed on all technically acceptable offerors whose past performance and price were evaluated, and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.     If no proposals are rated high confidence in the performance assessments, an integrated analysis will be accomplished on all technically acceptable proposals and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.

9.     The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price quote if that lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of very good or lower.  If discussions will be conducted, all quotes will be evaluated and rated for performance risk.     The contracting officer will then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.  The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.  Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit their most advantageous pricing in their initial response.  The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.       

10.     The following clauses and provisions are applicable to this solicitation:     FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items, FAR 52.219-1 Alt 1, Small Business Program Representations, FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside, DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications  Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, Addendum: Para (c) Changes is tailored as follows:     The contracting officer may modify the contract unilaterally under the following circumstances:     (a) to make administrative changes that do not affect the price or substantive terms; (b) to issue change orders or directions; or (c) to make changes authorized by clauses other than a changes clause, including but not limited to the Property clause, or Suspension of Work Clause.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisition Center (COAC) for the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) intend to issue a purchase order on a non competitive basis  to Dr. Lois K. Cohen, 6108 Madawaska Road, Bethesda, Maryland 20816, to provide expertise and input to the behavioral, social science and health promotion research activities of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR).   Background:  The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research recently established a Center for Health Promotion and Behavioral Research.  ?The Center for Health Promotion and Behavioral Research supports and conducts behavioral research, disease prevention and health promotion research, health data survey and analysis, and related activities aimed at improving and promoting oral, dental and craniofacial health.?  Health promotion research is a relatively new field of investigation, one that requires multi disciplinary and interdisciplinary efforts.  In addition the behavioral and social sciences are evolving and integrating with the basic and clinical biomedical sciences.  The Institute is in need of expertise in both of these fields in order to position itself and its research initiatives to take advantage of new scientific opportunities.  This expertise is needed to provide guidance to staff, support the development of new initiatives and facilitate national and global collaborations.  
Scope of Work. Contractor Responsibilities: The Contractor shall provide expertise and input to the behavioral, social science and health promotion research activities of the NIDCR.   Specifically, the Contractor shall: 1) Work with the NIDCR staff to develop new initiatives, building upon the Institute?s strategic plan.  Examples include: begin identification of subject-matter experts and exploring their cooperation, through the IADR and other social and behavioral science professional associations. ; exploring OBSSR and IC collaborations to leverage existing initiatives; and planning for an update of the State-of-the-Sciences, Disease Prevention & Oral Health Promotion (1995).  2) Provide staff assistance on NIH, national and global collaborations, with a focus on behavioral sciences.  Examples include: provide support in response to requests related to collaborations and to behavioral and social sciences; support and technical assistance for the WHO Collaborating Center for Dental & Craniofacial Research; and working with organized dentistry in planning for updating previous initiatives and exploring science transfer activities with the ADA and FDI. (e.g. guidelines for health promotion for use by professional associations).   3) Contribute to the development of strategies for behavioral science training and career development.  Examples include: assisting  in the development of a strategic plan for interdisciplinary training in the socio-dental sciences; and exploring sites and mentors, perhaps leveraging other IC training initiatives.   4) Provide support for major presentations related to behavioral and social science research.  Examples include: AAAS- Co-Chair (with James Melvin- Rochester) for the dental research session on science and technology for sustainable well-being, San Francisco, CA in February 2007; and FDI- Paper co-authored with L. Tabak on research investments with potential for prevention of disease and disability of people world-wide. The paper to be presented in China on September 22, 2006.

Government Requirement: The Government will provide working space and access to telephones, computers, the internet, and all material needed for this project.  The Government will also provide direct oversight of the contractors activities and will review any documents prior to contacting outside agencies or individuals.

Reporting Requirements:  The Contractor shall work closely with the Project Officer and shall report on ongoing activities on a daily basis. 

Dr. Lois K. Cohen is uniquely qualified for this requirement given her pivotal role in establishing the field and in nurturing its progress.  Specifically she has had long experience as  principal architect building  behavioral and social science capacity in dental research at the Federal level for more than four decades. There are no other experts with her extensive qualifications and her experience in extramural research management.   Dr. Cohen has conducted research for the U.S. Public Health Service in several areas from public attitudes and behaviors about water fluoridation and use of other preventive agents, to studies of providers? behaviors and adoption of innovations related to oral cancer diagnosis, to landmark studies comparing oral health systems around the globe.  Her research on national issues precipitated a need for obtaining critical information about the effectiveness and efficiencies of oral health strategies to meet the needs of all people, regardless of their socioeconomic status or geographic location. How the U.S. might learn from the longer experiences of other nations delivering health care services on a national basis was the motivating driver that enabled a body of health systems research related to oral health to be implemented and published in the peer-reviewed literature worldwide.  Dr. Cohen has published over 120 research papers, co-edited four books, including two volumes of Social Sciences and Dentistry. Her book, Disease Prevention and Oral Health Promotion, and the previous ones as well are directly relevant to the mission of the NIDCR?s new Center for Health Promotion and Behavioral Research.

The sole source determination is based upon the knowledge, skills and expertise possessed by Dr. Lois K. Cohen.  An award to any other source would affect the Institute?s anticipated outcome based upon Dr. Cohen?s experience, and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.  

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the Size Standard is $6.0M. This is a small business set-aside requirement.  This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  

Responses to the synopsis will be evaluated on their 1) understanding of the technical requirements and adequacy of their proposed approach; Experts in this field must have in depth knowledge and experience with both the health promotion and behavioral science research disciplines and the state of the science of these disciplines in relation to oral health research.  In addition experts must have knowledge and experience with extramural research programming and processes.  Theories in both of these fields have emerged and remain to be tested and modified for application in oral health research.  Experts must be able to contribute to research concept and program development.  To help with leading these new areas of research experts must be recognized nationally, and ideally globally. 2) Qualifications of Personnel.  Documented experience, qualifications, and availability of proposed personnel.  Supporting materials should include a curricula vita containing all relevant experience of proposed personnel as related to the requirements. 3) Past Performance.  Experience of proposed personnel and the organization as it pertains to the  requirement and past performance reports from previous contracts. Experience in projects similar to description in the statement of work.  At least three (3) references documenting past performance?s experiences and the successful completion of projects is to be submitted.  

The Offeror shall include in its response loaded hourly rates, prompt payment terms, business size, Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), Dun & Bradstreet Number (DUNs).  The Offeror must also register in the Government?s Contractor Registry System note: www.ccr.gov.   Responses are due May 8, 2006, at 12:00 noon local time.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in responses to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-Picatinny, Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce, is contemplating to conduct a full and open competitive procurement via a Broad  Agency Announcement for Research, Development, and Engineering Command- Armaments Research, Development and Engineering Center (RDECOM-ARDEC), Army  Corrosion Office, for programs in new materials, coatings technologies and  corrosion detection for mitigation and prevention of corrosion.  The Army  Corrosion Office and the Metallic Materials Technology Branch are interested in  proposals for advancing the state of art in corrosion abatement, prevention and  mitigation for weapon system and other Army Material.  The approach is rather  than to treat corrosion as an after the fact maintenance issue, the thrust is  to develop technologies, coatings and materials that a weapon system designer  could use to greatly reduce the corrosion burden.  In essence, the material  designer will have the information, tools, and protocols available to address  corrosion in the design of a product as to significantly reduce future  maintenance and costs of ownership. The Army Corrosion Office is interested in  technologies that will extend the life weapons, vehicles and other components. This BAA will be a continuously open announcement valid throughout the period from the date of issuance through 28 February 2009, unless announced  otherwise.  Possible award instruments are grants, cooperative agreement, other  transaction for research, other transaction for prototype, or procurement  contract.  Proposals received on or before 30 June 2006 will be considered for  a fiscal year 2006 award.  Proposal received after that date may or may not be  considered for award until the following fiscal year. The BAA will be available on the following websites: htttp://procnet.pica.army.mil/  http://www.fedbizopps.gov http://www.grants.gov The point of contact for this announcement is Kevin Puma, Contract Specialist,  kpuma@pica.army.mil

<DESC>***THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) HAS BEEN CANCELLED.  PLEASE REFER TO 2006-Q-08478***


The National Pandemic Plan of 2005 designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medicine for pandemic preparedness and response. Following the issuance of the  Department of Health and Human Services Pandemic Plan of 2005, the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP) was assigned the responsibility for the establishment of surge capacity, advanced development, , and acquisition of medical countermeasures such as diagnostics, vaccines  and antiviral drugs that may be used to diagnosis, contain, control, and mitigate the mortality and morbidity associated with influenza pandemics in the U.S. The tactical and logistical implementation of policies and decisions regarding these pandemic medical countermeasures is the responsibility of the Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OPHEP.   

***DESCRIPTION*** 
This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned. The Office of Research and Development  Coordination of the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness  has an interest in identifying potential platforms, technologies, methods, assays and reagents that can be applied to the detection, diagnosis and monitoring of influenza virus infections and disease. The use of appropriate diagnostic assays and equipment during influenza seasonal or pandemic outbreaks may provide for more timely and accurate detection of influenza outbreaks and thus delay or contain influenza infections in local communities, may reduce the morbidity and mortality, and may mitigate the increased load that will be placed on the healthcare system. Early detection of influenza by the use of appropriate tests will allow for  the determination of the parameters of the pandemic in sufficient time to provide effective disease central measures. Rapid, accurate high throughput laboratory bench systems and portable low cost point of care (POC) systems are both needed to identify and characterize the outbreak as quickly as possible and to provide timely data and information  to guide and monitor effective response measures. Responses to this RFI may address either or both of these areas (High throughput on POC) of identified interest but should clearly indicate which area of need is being addressed in the response. 

Rapid diagnostics for influenza viruses currently lack sufficient specificity and sensitivity and timeliness of results to provide clinically relevant information.  Diagnostic platforms and assays for influenza and influenza like illnesses are needed to provide timely diagnostic information to health care providers in the face of an emerging pandemic. Information is being sought on assays, methods and platforms that may meet near term and long-term program needs. 


	The responses should address the following issues:

•	Sensitivity-relative to culture of clinically significant levels of virus
10 to 106 TC/DO/ML if a specified influenza A virus strain
•	Specificity- ability to differentiate the target organism in the presence of a ten fold excess of near neighbors to distinguish specific strains of influenza virus.
•	Sample handling and preparation
•	Throughput capacity.
•	Platform flexibility/adaptability.
•	Operational simplicity.
•	Portability.
•	Non-Cross Reactivity-ability to detect influenza virus in presence of [illegible] and pathogenic microorganisms.
•	Estimates of cost factors.

HHS will use information obtained by this RFI in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy for National Pandemic Preparedness. All information submitted to HHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. 

Please submit information in the following format:
1)	Name of Submitter
2)	Address of Submitter
3)	Name of Device, Assay or technology
4)	Technical / Method Summary
5)	Device specifications
6)	Performance Summary including any supportive data
7)	Clinical samples tested to date
8)	Viral strains tested to date
9)	Points of Contact
10)	Bibliography and/or References

Information must be submitted by April 28, 2006. Responses should be limited to 20 pages, 12 Font, Times Roman,  single space, one sided or equivalent in an electronic and hard copy formats and can be e-mailed to the attention of Jeff Miller, Contract Specialist, phone 770-488-2651, e-mail afx2@cdc.gov.  Please ensure that at least one electronic and TWO (2) HARD COPIES of all responses are submitted.

SYNOPSIS FOR SOLICITATION DG1350-06-RP-0029


The Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, Office of Travel and Tourism requires contractor services for the development and support of a process to administer a monthly In-Flight Survey of International Travelers. Competed in accordance with FAR Part 15. This survey will provide statistical market data about the international air passenger travel market.  This is a pre-solicitation notice.

The data collected by this survey reflects the characteristics of the international travel population, with the collections proportionately coming from markets for inbound travel as well as destinations visited by U.S. travelers abroad.  This survey is the sole source for the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates for travel and passenger fare exports and imports, as well as multiple other Federal and private sector industry clients.  Quarterly estimates are produced from the survey based on reporting of monthly samples. By distributing the sample throughout each month of the quarter, the seasonal variances in travel patterns are reflected in the survey.  Due to the seasonal travel patterns of international travelers, the third quarter tends to be the largest survey period.  

This acquisition is set aside exclusively for small business concerns under authority of Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.203.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541910 and the related size standard is $6.0 million.  A solicitation will be posted to this Government wide point of entry on or about Tuesday, 21 February, 2006.  The Government estimates a fixed price contract to be awarded based on competition for one twelve month period and four twelve month option periods.  The estimated level of effort based on historical experience is 70,000-95,000 respondents per year.  There is considerable demand for a much larger sample, and potential contractors will be encouraged to develop strategies and methods to increase the sample of the program given financial constraints due to funding available.  

The Government foresees holding a pre-proposal conference for this acquisition approximately mid-March, during which potential contractors may obtain better understanding of the work required.  Further details relating to date, time, and location will be included in the solicitation.  Further information on the In-Flight Survey program can be found at the OTTI website: http://tinet.ita.doc.gov/research/programs/ifs/index.html

AIR COMMAND AND STAFF COLLEGE’S ONLINE MASTER’S DEGREE
PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT FOR DISTRIBUTED LEARNING COURSEWARE DEVELOPMENT AND DELIVERY

STATEMENT OF NEED

1. OBJECTIVE 

1.1 The objective of this Statement of Need (SON) is to describe, for preliminary planning purposes only, the requirements of the Air Command and Staff College (ACSC) for programmatic support in preparation for the launch of its online master’s degree program slated for January 2008 implementation. This SON captures in general terms the program management and distributed courseware development and delivery support ACSC requires in creating, marketing, and delivering coursewares. 

1.1.1 Program management support includes planning, programming, staffing, and strict adherence to educational theory and accreditation standards of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), as well as adherence to Joint Staff and Headquarters, United States Air Force educational requirements. It also includes integrating coursewares with a Curriculum Management System (CMS) for worldwide delivery, the establishment of asynchronous, collaborative-learning environments for student-faculty interaction, and the creation, delivery, scoring, and results-posting of student learning assessments. Lastly, program management includes student enrollment, status-tracking, and grade reporting, as well as faculty marketing, recruitment, and training.

1.1.2 Distributed courseware development and delivery includes developing online coursewares, presented via print, streaming video, and interactive learning modules/simulations, to as many as 4,000 students worldwide via a CMS that features asynchronous, collaborative learning. Coursewares will be Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) compliant and will address the following subject areas:

1.1.2.1 Military History and Strategy

1.1.2.2 National Security Strategy and Decision Making

1.1.2.3 Leadership and Command

1.1.2.4 Joint Force Organization, Planning, and Employment

1.1.2.5 Cultural Awareness

1.1.2.6 Current Operations

1.1.3 Modularity. Each of the courses will be modular – independent of the others, so that each can be modified without requiring modification of the entire program. Additionally, the master’s degree will integrate the existing online Professional Military Education (PME) course that is currently being offered for non-degree development of military officers. 

2. MISSION STATEMENT

2.1  The Mission of ACSC is as follows:  “To our students... Inspire critically thinking Airmen to lead Air & Space forces in Joint/Combined operations. To our faculty and staff... Provide an intellectually stimulating environment that attracts, develops, and rewards the finest team of educator-leaders possible.”

If you are a firm with this expertise, please send a white paper outlining your background in these areas. Please do not send general marketing information. This is not a solicitation for a proposal. This information will be used for planning purposes only.

This information should be submitted to 42d Contracting Squadron, Acquisition Flight B-1, Building 804, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6334, ATTN: Susan Taunton, or emailed to susan.taunton@maxwell.af.mil. Reference solicitation number FA3300-AU-DLMST.

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

<DESC>Modification 3 to Pre-solicitation Notice MCC-06-RFP-0007

The Pre-solicitation Notice (Revision 2) published 11-18-2005 has the following changes.  

The response deadline is unchanged and remains 12-7-2005 for Track 1 responses and for Track 2 the deadline remains 12-14-2005.  

The time for receipt of questions has expired.

In preparing responses, attention is also directed to Responses to Questions Received through 11-20-2005 and Response #2 to Questions Received through 11-25-2005 (Part 1) posted to this notice.

Please note that Responses to Questions Received through 11-25-2005 (Part 2) will be posted on/about 12-1-2005.

The following changes are made to the Pre-solicitation Notice.  (For ease of reading, the Pre-solicitation Notice Revision of 11-18-05 has been updated and entitled “Pre-solicitation Notice (Revision 3)” and reprinted in entirety under upload Revision 3.)

A.	Page 1, Description, delete the two paragraphs in their entirety and replace with the following:

The MCC requires professional technical services to provide assessments and evaluations of infrastructure projects which are candidates for funding by MCC.  Included in these services may be a range of engineering services and other consulting services in connection with the development, assessment, monitoring, and evaluation of infrastructure projects in developing countries to be evaluated and funded by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC).  
B.	Section 1, “Contract Information”, delete the first paragraph and replace with the following:

Multiple Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards are anticipated under three (3) focuses  (1) infrastructure sub-sector(s), (2) geographic region(s), and (3) competency areas(s) (see Project Information below), each with a base year and four one-year options.  However, MCC reserves the right to make awards based on infrastructure “sub” sub-sectors and/or competency areas(s).  There may be some IDIQ awards for a wide range of coverage and others which provide a narrower but specialized combination of services.  
   
The government may exercise option periods unilaterally.     
Firms will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.     Performance will be authorized through the competitive award of individual task orders each of which will have a specific scope and period of performance.    
Professional Technical Services EXCLUDING architect-engineering services will be procured in accordance with FAR Part 15.  Professional Technical Services INCLUDING architect-engineering services will be procured in accordance with Brooks Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.    Firms may receive IDIQ contract awards for both professional technical services including and excluding A-E services.  
Task Orders (TOs), as issued, may or may not include architect-engineering (A-E) services.  When issued, TOs will clearly state whether A-E services are included in the Statement of Work.  Competition under TOs containing A-E services will be restricted to those IDIQ contractors whose contracts are awarded in accordance with FAR Subpart 36.6.
C.	Section 1, “Contract Information”, delete the sixth paragraph and replace with the following:

This announcement is open to ALL qualified firms; the IDIQ award is NOT a small business set-aside.  Considering this acquisition is being conducted for future, unspecified services which will result from current and future MCC candidate infrastructure projects, professional technical services actually purchased may fall in any number or combination of North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code(s) under Category 54-Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.  However, it is anticipated that the preponderance of task order services will include engineering services classified under NAICS code 541330.  
For business size classification only, under the IDIQ award, business size wion Requirements” insert the following at the end of the segment:

RESPONSES MUST BE IN WRITING WITH A CD COPY.  Electronic copies may be submitted only in lieu of the CD.  Responses should be labeled with the solicitation number; date and time specified in the notice for receipt of response; and name, address, and telephone number of the firm.  

Include in the response, preferably the cover letter, the name and title of the person authorized to conduct discussions with MCC on behalf of the firm and an alternate; and, if different, name of person authorized to commit the company.  For each individual include their DIRECT mailing addresses, voice/fax numbers, AND email addresses.  During evaluations the primary initial method of communications will be through email.  Please also include the firm’s business size/socio-economic status and acknowledgment of the pre-solicitation modifications; notices; and responses to questions.

The firms agree to hold the technical and price sections of response firm for a minimum of 60 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of responses.

H.	Section 3, “Selection Evaluation Factors and Sub-factors”, Track 2 the following italicized word changes are made:

Track 2 evaluations will be conducted separately from Track 1 evaluations.  Award of the multiple IDIQ contracts under Track 2 will be made upon conclusion of evaluations and rate negotiations.  ……

Note: Upon conclusion of IDIQ awards under Track 2, firms receiving awards under  both or either Track 1 and Track 2 will equally participate in competitive task order award activities within their respective award focus.

(For ease of reading, the Pre-solicitation Notice Revision of 11-10-05 has been updated and entitled “Pre-solicitation Notice (Revision 2)” and reprinted in entirety under upload Revision 2.)

Section 1, “Contract Information”, delete the second and third paragraphs and replace with the following:

The value and ceiling of each contract will be determined based on the sub-sector(s) and competency area(s).     The cumulative maximum value of task orders issued will not exceed $20 million per year.

Work will be issued by negotiated firm fixed price or time and materials task orders.   

 Performance will be authorized through the competitive award of individual task orders each of which will have a specific scope and period of performance.     Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates.

Section 1, “Contract Information”, delete the last paragraph and replace with the following:

To be eligible for award, the potential contractor(s) must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).     Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov.  Foreign companies are directed to the Vendor Corner of the CCR, http://www.ccr.gov/vendor.asp, specifically answer under Tips for Companies Located Outside the United States.  No RFP will be issued as a result of this notice.

Section 3, “Selection Evaluation Factors and Sub-factors”, the following language is inserted between section “3 Selection Evaluation Factors and Sub-factors” and sub-section “3.1 Professional Qualifications”.


3       Selection Evaluation Factors and Sub-factors

(Special Notice:  Considering multiple Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards are anticipated under each of the three (3) focuses  (1) infrastructure sub-sector(s), (2) geographic region(s), and (3) competency areas(s), rate negotiations will be conducted with firms ranking as highest qualified firms for each focus.  Task Orders will be negotiated with the most preferred firm in accordance with FAR 36.606 after evaluation board review of the IDIQ contractors under the associated focus.)

For this pre-solicitation notice evaluations will be conducted under two (2) separate evaluation tracks.   Responses will initially be reviewed to determine the firm’s experience in successfully competing for MCC contract awards.  Those firms demonstrating previous success in obtaining contract awards from MCC for similar services will be evaluated under Track 1.  Firms without previous experience in obtaining contract awards with MCC will be evaluated under Track 2.

Note that the Submission Requirements in Section 4 apply to responses under both Track 1 and Track 2.

Track 1 Evaluations

Track 1 evaluations will be conducted prior to Track 2 evaluations.  Award of the multiple IDIQ contracts under Track 1 will be made upon conclusion of evaluations and rate negotiations.  It is anticipated that award of IDIQ contracts under Track 1 will be completed on/about 1-10-2006.   To meet this award schedule, firms selected as highest qualified firms will have two (2) business days from date of request to submit rate proposals.  MCC anticipates commencing competitive task order award activitll be based on the NAICS code which best describes the general nature of the services provided by the firm.  Firms may determine their business size by going to https://eweb1.sba.gov/naics/dsp_naicssearch2.cfm.  Based on the array of contractor business sizes under the IDIQ awards, the MCC may determine, on a task-order-by-task-order basis, to set aside competition under a specific task order for participation by qualified small business contractors.  The size determination of small business, in this instance, will be based on the NAICS code assigned to the task order.
D.	Section 1, “Contract Information”, delete the eighth paragraph.  It has been incorporated under Section 3, “Selection Evaluation Factors and Sub-factors”, the revised paragraph 4.

E.	Section 2, “Project Information”, the following language is inserted at the end:

2.5	Security

The Contractor shall be SOLELY responsible for providing background investigations on ALL personnel who are assigned in the performance of any/all work done under individual task orders, as well as paying the cost of background investigations.  Work cannot begin on a task order until the requirements stated here and below are met.

The work performed under this contract shall only be accomplished by individuals (in the employment of the Contractor or any Subcontractors) whose conduct is consistent with applicable security levels, the requirements of this contract, and acceptable to the Contracting Officer (CO) in conjunction with the MCC Security Office. 

The risk/sensitivity level designation of the activities performed under this contract will be specified in the individual task order (low/moderate/high risk).  In the event a task order is issued without the risk/sensitivity level designated, the contractor shall provide background investigation commensurate with a high risk level.  The Contractor shall conduct a background investigation of each individual prior to that individual performing work under a task order and affirmatively determine that each individual meets this contract’s minimum standards of acceptability.  The minimum standards of acceptability shall be at least commensurate with the suitability determinations contained in the DOI Departmental Manual Part 441, Chapter 3 which is available on the internet at http://elips.doi.gov/app_home/index.cfm?fuseaction=home or as may be otherwise determined by the MCC Security Office.

In response to a task order, the contractor shall propose only those individuals who have, or are in the position to successfully complete, the required background investigations.  The contractor shall provide to the COTR, within 3 business days after task order award, written confirmation that Contractor/subcontractor personnel under the task order has had the required background investigation and has a favorable determination of their suitability prior to commencement of any work. 
 
For each individual, the written confirmation will include a listing providing the individual’s full name, date of birth, place of birth, social security number (except for foreign contractors not issued a number) and home address.  In addition, the contractor will provide a central point-of-contact regarding personnel security issues.  The contracting officer will send a copy of the listing and point-of-contact to the MCC Security Office.  It is the MCC Security Office’s responsibility to determine if further information or background investigations are needed.

Contractor personnel shall be reinvestigated by the Contractor (or subcontractor, as appropriate) on a periodic basis; however, at least annually.  

The Contractor shall notify the CO and COTR immediately when its employee is reassigned, or leaves the Contractor’s (subcontractor’s) employ.  Prior notice shall be given to CO and COTR immediately in the case of an unfriendly termination.

In the event of a disagreement between the Contractor and the MCC concerning the suitability of a particular employee to perform work under this contract, the MCC Contracting Officer shall have the right of final determination.  Determinations under this requirement are subject to the Disputes Clause.  Failure of the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this clause would constitute grounds for termination for default.

F.	Section 3, “Selection Evaluation Factors and Sub-factors”, paragraph 4, “Submission Requirements” delete first and third paragraphs and insert the following:

4.        Submission Requirements (Track 1 and Track 2)
A.	For award of contracts allowing competition under task orders for Professional Technical Services INCLUDING architect/engineering services:
Final selection of the most highly qualified firms and negotiation of contract rates will be done in accordance with FAR Part 36.   Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit three (3) copies of responses including SF 330, Parts I and II (GSA Form Library at www.gsa.gov). 
Responses should be submitted considering the instructions on the SF330 and the information requested in this pre-solicitation notice.  Additional sheets and supplemental information may be included; however, unnecessarily elaborate and lengthy supplemental information is discouraged and may reflect that the responding firm does not understand the requirement and the specific information requested.

Considering FAR Subpart 36.6 procedures and that multiple Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract awards are anticipated under each of the three (3) focuses  (1) infrastructure sub-sector(s), (2) geographic region(s), and (3) competency areas(s), price (labor and burden rate) negotiations will be conducted with firms ranking as highest qualified firms for each focus.  

When work is identified, following award of IDIQ contracts, task order specific services and selection criteria will be provided to the contractors to supplement their SF330s.     The SF330s and supplements will be used to determine the most highly qualified firms. Task Orders will be negotiated with the most preferred firm in accordance with FAR 36.606 after evaluation board review of the IDIQ contractors under the associated focus.

B.	For award of contracts allowing competition under task orders for Professional Technical Services EXCLUDING architect-engineering services:
Responses must be submitted responding to all of the selection evaluation factors and sub-factors provided above.  Responses must be in 2 sections: Technical and Price.  The format of the response is at the discretion of the firm; however, the response must clearly present the firm’s capabilities, capacity, and past performance  for evaluation.  Evaluation will be based solely on the information presented in the response.  
The Technical part shall include the firm’s technical response to this notice.  The Price part shall include the fully burdened direct labor rates for each labor category proposed and any other burdened rate and its application.  
Technical evaluation will be in accordance with the above evaluation factors and sub-factors.  Price evaluation will be performed to determine the reasonableness of each firm’s pricing.  Price evaluation will consider the base and option year rates.  The Government may determine that pricing is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options will not obligate the MCC to exercise the option(s).  
Award will be made to the firm whose submission represents the best value to the MCC.  The MCC will consider price as a factor in the evaluation; however, the non-price evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price. 
Firms wishing to receive awards for professional technical services including AND excluding A-E services MUST submit responses in accordance with paragraph A below.

The government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror submitting the quote that provides the best value to the government.     Award is contingent upon availability of funds. The associated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 333512; size standard 500 employees.

2.     The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items, are applicable to this solicitation.     Interested parties may submit a written quote in accordance with FAR 52.212-1.     Oral quotes will not be accepted.

3.     FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.     Addendum:     Basis for Award:     This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing Performance/Price Tradeoff (PPT) procedures.     For proposals determined technically acceptable, a tradeoff between price and past performance will be conducted with past performance being significantly more important than price.     Offers shall propose on all items.     Only firm fixed price offers will be evaluated.     An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.     Quotes determined to be unreasonable or not compatible with the scope of effort or either excessive or insufficient for the effort to be accomplished will not be considered in the performance/price trade-off and will be ineligible for award. 

4.     The evaluation process will proceed as follows:     (a) Technical Acceptance:     By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all the terms, conditions, statement of work, and all other requirements of this solicitation and subsequent contract, and will be determined technically acceptable.     Any exception taken to the terms, conditions, or requirements will result in a determination of technical unacceptability; (b) Price:     Initially, all technically acceptable offers will be ranked according to price.     Reasonableness will be determined based on prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate and prior acquisitions, if applicable.     Realism will be based on an evaluation of prices to determine if they are compatible with the scope of effort, are not unbalanced, and are neither excessive nor insufficient for the effort to be accomplished    c) Past Performance:   Using questionnaires, the contracting officer will seek relevant and recent performance information on all technically acceptable offers based on (1) the references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Recency:     To be considered recent, a contract shall have been performed during the past three years from the date of issuance of this posting.     Relevancy:     Relevant performance includes performance of work efforts that is similar or greater in scope and magnitude.     The following varying degrees of relevancy apply to this solicitation: Very Relevant	Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Relevant Present/past performance effort involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Somewhat Relevant Present/past performance contractual effort involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities than this solicitation requires.  Not Relevant Present/past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.  Offerors shall submit a minimum of 3 references, but no more than 5 overall of the most relevant contracts performed for Federal agencies and commercial customers.     The offeror shall provide the attached past performance questionnaire to the reference and bear responsibility for ensuring that the reference provides the completed questionnaire to the point of contact identified in paragraph 11 of this posting by the deadline for offer submission.     Questionnaires submitted prior to the deadline for offer submission will be accepted.     The reference list should include, as a minimum: Contract Number, Description of Contract/Project Effort, Period of Performance, Contract Dollar Value, Name, Title, Current Address and Telephone Number of Contracting Officer and Quality Assurance Evaluator/Project Manager.
 
5.     The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in this solicitation based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.     The agency will evaluate past performance in accordance with the criteria in paragraphs 4(c) through 8 of this solicitation.     The rating may be determined initially or as a result of discussions.     The confidence assessment represents the Government evaluation team's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.     A trade-off process is then conducted.     The lowest price may not necessarily receive the award; likewise, the highest past performance rating may not necessarily receive the award.     A performance/price trade-off evaluation will not be conducted if only one acceptable offeror is received.     In this event, award will be made to the only technically acceptable quote received.     

6.     Overall confidence ratings are defined as follows: High Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has high confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Significant Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has significant confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has confidence the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     Normal contractor emphasis should preclude any problems. Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable. Little Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, substantial doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.     No Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, extreme doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

7.     Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant and recent experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement may not be rated as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror.     Offerors with no relevant present or past performance history will receive a neutral rating, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.     However, a rating other than neutral may be assessed if the offeror proposes management personnel who have a record of performance on relevant contracts, or if a proposed subcontractor or partner who will be performing a significant portion of the work has a performance history on relevant contracts.     When relevant performance information indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised).     Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.     The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness.     The offeror may be notified of any adverse past performance information and given the opportunity to respond. 

8.     If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is determined to be reasonable and realistic, and is judged to have an overall high performance confidence rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.     Award will be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.     If the lowest priced technically acceptable offer is not rated high confidence in the performance assessment, the next lowest priced, technically acceptable offer will be evaluated and the process will continue until an offeror whose price is reasonable and realistic is rated high confidence overall for past performance.     An integrated assessment will then be performed on all technically acceptable offerors whose past performance and price were evaluated, and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.     If no proposals are rated high confidence in the performance assessments, an integrated analysis will be accomplished on all technically acceptable proposals and award will be made to the offeror with the proposal determined to be most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation criteria.

9.     The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price quote if that lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of very good or lower.  If discussions will be conducted, all quotes will be evaluated and rated for performance risk.     The contracting officer will then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.  The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.  Therefore, offerors are encouraged to submit their most advantageous pricing in their initial response.  The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.       

10.     The following clauses and provisions are applicable to this solicitation:     FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items, FAR 52.219-1 Alt 1, Small Business Program Representations, FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside, DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications  Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, Addendum: Para (c) Changes is tailored as follows:     The contracting officer may modify the contract unilaterally under the following circumstances:     (a) to make administrative changes that do not affect the price or substantive terms; (b) to issue change orders or directions; or (c) to make changes authorized by clauses other than a changes clause, including but not limited to the Property clause, or Suspension of Work Clause.

<DESC>SOLICITATION CLARIFICATIONS Page 5: 52.212-1, paragraph (h) "Multiple Awards": Please confirm it is the  Government's intent to award only one contract as a result of this  solicitation.   It is the Governmentâ€™s intent to only award one contract. Page 8: FAR 252.219-7011: This clause contains the phrase, "...ineligible for  this 8(a) award..." (italics added). Please confirm that this acquisition is  unrestricted as indicated in Block 10 of the SF 1449.   The acquisition is unrestricted. Page 10, â€˜Basis for Awardâ€™: The merit rating is an integrated assessment of past performance and price.  d. Paragraph 1.2 also states that the Government reserves the right to award  to "other than highest technically rated" offeror. Since there is no technical  proposal required (question 4.b below applies), please clarify how the  Government intends to determine technical ratings and specify the importance of  technical ratings relative to merit rating: price and past performance.    Technical rating refers to information provided as part of past performance and in this case is synonymous with past performance. e. Identify the ways in which prices of Small Business offerors will be evaluated differently from those of large businesses; specifically, any and all  differences in the quantitative method(s) used by the Government to calculate the evaluated price of Small Business offers as compared to the evaluated price of large business offers.   Both small and large businesses will be evaluated the same. Page 11, second paragraph of Basis for Award paragraph 2.7: This paragraph  states, "The Past Performance factor is the least important in relation to the  merit rating (bid sample and technical areas) and price factors as described  above."   This sentence should be considered deleted from the solicitation. a. There does not appear to be any other reference to a bid sample requirement.  Please clarify if a bid sample is required.   A bid sample is not required and should be removed from this paragraph. b. There does not appear to be any other reference to proposal content  addressing "technical areas". Please clarify if a technical proposal is  required and, if so, specify the required content and format and explain the  basis for evaluation.   Technical proposal (other than Past Performance information requested) is not  required. Page 13, "Delivery Schedule": a. Confirm the planned contract award date or indicate a "not later than" date  for contract award, so we can verify that we can meet the firm receipt dates  indicated for the JMICs, Collapsible Racks, and Double-Length Base Units.  The planned contract award date is on or about 15 June 2006. b. For CLINs 0001 and 0002 the previous version of the solicitation requested  quantity range pricing for the optional production quantities (CLINs 0001AC and  0002AC, respectively). The Revised Solicitation does not appear to allow for  quantity range pricing. We believe it is in the Government's interest to use  quantity range pricing as it allows offerors to account for efficiencies in  purchasing and production that apply to each quantity range. We request the  Government specify quantity ranges for CLINs 0001AC and 0002AC as follows: 0001AC			0002AC 1 to 10			1 to 10 11 to 25		11 to 25 26 to 100		26 to 100 101 to 200		101 to 160 201 to 300 The SubCLINs above should include these quantities. Page 16 CLIN 0003: The RFP requires a fixed price for the Double-Length Base  Unit which is not yet designed. For pricing purposes, please indicate the  Government's estimated weight of the Double-Length Base Unit and the  approximate percentage of parts commonality with the JMIC.   The estimated weight is approximately double that of the JMIC â€“ the JMIC is  approximately 325 lbs, so the double-length is approximately 650 lbs.   Commonality of parts is 90% - itâ€™s basically the same as the JMIC but double  the length. Has the Government funded any contractor, subcontractor, or consultant to  fabricate all or part of the JMIC or Collapsible Rack, to either the current  design or a predecessor design? If so, please identify the firm and indicate if  this firm be allowed to bid on this procurement.   No, the items were made by in-house Government.  Assuming results of LMUA/MUA is favorable, how does the Government plan to  procure additional JMICs? Will the contract resulting from this solicitation be  modified or will a new competitive procurement for full production be  undertaken?   Option quantities will take care of these requirements. There does not appear to be any Buy American requirement. Please confirm there  is no restriction on foreign material content or on foreign value-added  content.   There is no restriction on foreign material content or on foreign value-added content. Please confirm that the Government has built and tested JMICs and Collapsible  Racks per the design specified by the RFP and that those units met all tare  weight, performance, and test requirements specified in the RFP and associated  technical data package.   Yes, these have been tested or will be tested prior to contract award. Is there a separate Critical Item Product Fabrication Specification for the  Collapsible Rack JMIC Assembly (7516585) similar to the one for (7516510)?  There is a separate Critical Item Production Fabrication Spec for the  Colllapsible Rack JMIC Assembly (7516585) being developed - it's in for  signature now.  It will be very similar to the Spec for the JMIC Container and  will be provided shortly.   In reference to FAR clause 52.246-1 - Does Picatinny have any reporting  requirements of the (major) Classification of Characteristics features listed  in the drawing package for this solicitation?   There are no special reporting requirements for Major Characteristics.

FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This contract is required by the Armys initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Integrated Global Presence and Basing Strategy (IGPBS), and the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, although the projects may be requ ired from any Military Program.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The execution of the work under the Military C onstruction Program will be accomplished using a product line concept for the facilities.  The product line concept will be used for the construction of barracks, dining facilities, company operation facilities, headquarters buildings, vehicle maintenance shops, unit and ammunition storage facilities, aviation facilities, equipment parking areas, and other features of the program.  Under the product line concept, Districts in the Corps of Engineers Southwestern and South Pacific Divisions will be assigned one or two facility types and will be responsible for awarding Design-Build IDIQ contracts for their assigned type of facility (product line).  When there is a requirement for their facility type, each District product line team will scope, negotiate, and award a task order to deliver the required facilities to the Program Office assigned to manage the overall project. The District product line team will assist with the administration of the task order to include design reviews, submittals, and modification s.  The design/build contractor for each product line will be responsible for maintaining current documents and incorporating into future task orders changes in army criteria as well as, modification, and clarification identified in ongoing task orders.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small businesses and 8(a) firms to conduct a survey to determine the individual and aggregate capacity of the longline, and pole and line fleets operating in the western and central Pacific Ocean that fish for yellowfin, albacore, skipkack or bigeye tunas and swordfish.  

The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS code 541990 with a size standard of $6.0 million.  
 
Offerors will be expected to compile a list of longline and pole and line vessel fleets in the western and central Pacific.  The offeror shall compile available information for the current period (no further back than calendar 2004).  This shall include a breakdown by nationality of the number of distant water, foreign-flagged locally based and Pacific Island registered longline and pole and line vessels.  The offeror, shall where possible, provide physical characteristics for the large scale longline fleets (large scale being over >24 meters) and for those fleets composed of vessels below 24m,  a vessel classification system shall be provided along with the number of vessels in each vessel class.  The relevant physical information shall be provided on vessels typical for each class of
vessel identified. At a minimum all vessels over 15 meters shall be included. 

Physical parameters (e.g., length overall, hold size, gross register tons, horse power) of the vessels in each fleet or class should be provided to the degree possible.  Ideally this would be standardized or convertible metrics. The offeror shall, where possible, also compile information on physical measures that can be used as proxies for standard capacity measures B such, but not limited to, vessel hold dimensions, vessel dimensions such as gross registered tons or length (overall) and or horsepower.  Provide vessel crew size where possible.  
In the case of long line fleets previous estimates of global longline fishing capacity rely heavily on (a) various lists, many which are of dubious quality, (b) previous studies, many of which rely on other studies of unknown quality or the same dubious lists. To avoid perpetrating inaccuracies, the offeror shall critically scrutinize those lists, use industry contacts, make site visits, and ground truth the information received.

The offeror shall assemble available information from all relevant WCPFC national registries (members and cooperating non-members), and well as those from multilateral organizations such as FFA and IATTC that are in the public domain, or to which NMFS can obtain permission to summarize.  

The offeror shall assemble available information from the WCPFC record of authorized vessels.

The offeror shall assemble available information on longline and pole and line participation in the western and central Pacific from the data holdings of the Oceanic Fisheries Program of the Pacific Community for the most current complete data available. 

The offeror shall document to the degree possible longline fleets that have periodically fished in the WCPFC area (within the last 10 years)– including those relevant fleets from Asian Nations including Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam.

The offeror shall identify key gaps in the available information and give the considerations involved in obtaining more detailed/quantitative/technical estimates of characteristics that affect longline and pole and line capacity.  For example the offeror shall, but would not be limited to, an analysis of the costs and practicality (and benefits) of obtaining more precise (quantitative) estimates of WCPO longline and pole and line capacity.

NOAA intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract for the work described above.  Firms that feel they can provide the tasks as addressed above should provide a capability statement to Contract Specialist, Stephanie Kyles by email at Stephanie.m.kyles@noaa.gov no later than 2:00 PM (Hawaii Time) May 3, 2006. Please include the following information in the capability statement: name of prior contract(s) completed of this nature, organization the contract was completed for, dates of the contract period of performance, a contact name and phone number for the organization, and the approximate dollar value of the contract.  Offerors shall also include a description of significant collaboration and subcontracting that will be required to provide a technically acceptable finished product.   Offerors shall also state what type of company they represent (i.e. small business, large business, foreign entity, not for profit, etc.) Please be sure to include a DUNS # and CCR Cage code # for your organization.  All questions regarding this announcement should be addressed to the Contract Specialist at 808-944-2228.

AIR COMMAND AND STAFF COLLEGE’S ONLINE MASTER’S DEGREE
PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORT FOR DISTRIBUTED LEARNING COURSEWARE DEVELOPMENT AND DELIVERY

STATEMENT OF NEED

1. OBJECTIVE 

1.1 The objective of this Statement of Need (SON) is to describe, for preliminary planning purposes only, the requirements of the Air Command and Staff College (ACSC) for programmatic support in preparation for the launch of its online master’s degree program slated for January 2008 implementation. This SON captures in general terms the program management and distributed courseware development and delivery support ACSC requires in creating, marketing, and delivering coursewares. 

1.1.1 Program management support includes planning, programming, staffing, and strict adherence to educational theory and accreditation standards of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), as well as adherence to Joint Staff and Headquarters, United States Air Force educational requirements. It also includes integrating coursewares with a Curriculum Management System (CMS) for worldwide delivery, the establishment of asynchronous, collaborative-learning environments for student-faculty interaction, and the creation, delivery, scoring, and results-posting of student learning assessments. Lastly, program management includes student enrollment, status-tracking, and grade reporting, as well as faculty marketing, recruitment, and training.

1.1.2 Distributed courseware development and delivery includes developing online coursewares, presented via print, streaming video, and interactive learning modules/simulations, to as many as 4,000 students worldwide via a CMS that features asynchronous, collaborative learning. Coursewares will be Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) compliant and will address the following subject areas:

1.1.2.1 Military History and Strategy

1.1.2.2 National Security Strategy and Decision Making

1.1.2.3 Leadership and Command

1.1.2.4 Joint Force Organization, Planning, and Employment

1.1.2.5 Cultural Awareness

1.1.2.6 Current Operations

1.1.3 Modularity. Each of the courses will be modular – independent of the others, so that each can be modified without requiring modification of the entire program. Additionally, the master’s degree will integrate the existing online Professional Military Education (PME) course that is currently being offered for non-degree development of military officers. 

2. MISSION STATEMENT

2.1  The Mission of ACSC is as follows:  “To our students... Inspire critically thinking Airmen to lead Air & Space forces in Joint/Combined operations. To our faculty and staff... Provide an intellectually stimulating environment that attracts, develops, and rewards the finest team of educator-leaders possible.”

<CONTACT>Megan Dake, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-997-4374, Fax null, Email Megan.Dake@dhs.gov - Megan Dake, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-997-4374, Fax null, Email Megan.Dake@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration’s (TSA) Office of Security’s Personnel Security Division (PerSec) uses a mission critical application called BITS to document receipt of all paperwork, all adjudication actions, all clearance actions, incoming and outgoing visit requests, reinvestigations and appeals.  The BITS is a client-server application with a MS Access front end and an MS SQL backend. There are also standalone ID Card and Credential Production Systems, which are COTS products, facilitating PerSec activities. PerSec wants to consolidate the BITS and the ID card systems into a centralized, web-based security solution.  TSA prefers a solution that builds on hardware and software already deployed at TSA or that is based on COTS products. TSA understands some customization or extension of available COTS products may be required to comply with new Federal standards such as FIPS 201.   The system must do the following: 

Be a secure, web-based personnel security and suitability management system, use role and organization based privileges for access management, be a centralized repository for all personnel security records including identity records, provide audit records of all cases, actions, and data transactions (imports/exports), provide in-process visibility for case status, provide real-time status for all personnel and credential case, provide interfaces for National Finance Center, OPM PIPS and OPM Clearance Verification System, include customizable, rule-based workflow functionality for case management, meet the FIPS 201 registration requirements for ID card issuance, automatically initiate notifications for reinvestigations or re-credentialing per business rules, provide for the integration of ID card management, support physical access control, facility management, and information security functionality provide for the electronic submission of forms and biometric data to external sources (i.e. OPM), integrate personnel security vetting with card issuance and management, secure personnel identity information in accordance with DHS/TSA directives, and support dynamic reporting on all aspects of information in the system.

The current TSA computing environment uses Sun hardware running the Solaris operating system and Dell hardware running the Microsoft Windows Server operating system. TSA uses both the Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle relational database management systems, uses the Oracle Application Server and uses some components of the Oracle 11i Application Suite.  Following TSA’s verification and validation of the system, the contractor shall work with the TSA to implement the hosting environment on TSA approved servers and provide system support as well as training on the new system. 

The vendor must hold a GSA Schedule 70 contract and be a Small Business.  Three page capability statements outlining the vendor’s qualifications and experience with this type of requirement may be sent to the Contracting Officer, Megan Dake, at megan.dake@dhs.gov, no later then Wednesday, 5/3/05 at 12:00 PM EST.  General marketing material will not be considered.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Lakehurst is requesting information pertaining to the replacement of the existing shipboard A/S32A-32 (SD-2) Spotting Dolly, which is used for aircraft movement in the tight confines of shipboard hangar bays.  For the purposes of this RFI, the new replacement spotting dolly shall be called the SD-3.  The SD-3 will be required to operate on CV/CVNs, L-class air capable ships and the new Littoral Combat Ship LCS.  It will be required to maneuver and park/spot the following aircraft in the hangar bay: AV-8B, E/A-6B, E-2C, F/A-18(C, D, E, F), HLR, H-53E, JSF, H-60, and V-22.  The current spotting dolly accomplishes this by engaging the aircraft nose/tail gear, lifting the nose/tail wheel off the deck and utilizing its zero turning radius to maneuver/rotate about the nose/tail gear while pushing or towing.  The SD-3 must be configured to allow the vehicle to pass under the aircraft to access the nose/tail wheel and to pass under parked aircraft to traverse a packed hangar bay.  It must be able to tow all the above aircraft around the hangar bay and onto the ships elevator.  The Government is requesting information on the availability of a diesel, hybrid, or all electric powered vehicle that would be capable of performing the duties of the current spotting dolly.  The SD-3 shall require the following features:  1) Dead man type operator controls.  2) Emergency stop system.  3) Red running lights and a horn easily accessible to the operator.  4) Zero turning radius about the center of the vehicle/aircraft engagement point.  5) Attachment mechanism that prevents disengagement of the nose/tail gear when raised off the deck.  6) Capable of lowering the nose/tail gear and disengaging from it without contacting any surface of the aircraft at angles up to 90 degrees to port or starboard with respect to the aircraft’s centerline.  7) When inoperable the SD-3 shall be able to be manually disengaged from the aircraft and have its drive system disengaged/released to allow it to be towed with an aircraft tow bar or pushed.  8) A parking brake capable of holding the vehicle on a 12-degree grade.  9) No wider than 81 inches, no higher than 29 inches, have a ground clearance of 5 inches, and have a minimum approach/departure angle of 10 degrees.  10) Tie down/lifting attachment points.  The SD-3 performance parameters must include:  11) Ability to lift a nose/tail gear weighing 16,000 pounds and hold at variable heights above the deck from 4.5 inches to 32 inches while moving aircraft.  
12) Exert a minimum drawbar pull of 14,000 pounds when loaded.  13) Forward and reverse speed when loaded shall not exceed 3 MPH but be capable of towing the heaviest aircraft at a speed of 2.5 MPH.  14) The SD-3 shall be capable of stopping within 2 feet from top speed when unloaded and stopping all aircraft within 2 feet from top speed in a straight line without use of the aircraft’s brakes by releasing the operator’s controls.  
15) The ability to make 10 to 12 aircraft moves from spot parked to elevator within a 24-hour period without refueling or recharging.  If battery powered, will fully recharge in 8 to 12 hours and have an on board charger that only requires 110V 60Hz power.  As required for any typical Navy Support Equipment (SE), the SD-3 shall be highly reliable, maintainable, and supportable.   The SD-3 shall be capable of meeting vibration, shock, environmental, EMI and mobility criteria.  Human factors engineering shall be utilized to the greatest extent possible to make the SD-3 a “user friendly” piece of Support Equipment.

Please provide commercial pamphlets, operating and maintenance manuals, or any other documentation that would describe a unit to meet the above requirements.  It is anticipated that if a solicitation is issued it would be for a quantity of approximately 114 SD-3s.  It is requested that information be submitted NO LATER THAN 07 March 2006 to Ms. Lori Bishop, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Code 25211B562-1, Highway 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5082, or by electronic mail at: lori.bishop@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management on behalf of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for a one base year plus one option year contract with the National Association of State Councils on Developmental Disabilities (NACDD) on a sole source basis to continue training and technical assistance to the 55 State Councils on Developmental Disabilities. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD), located within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is the Federal agency responsible for implementation and administration of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (DD Act of 2000) (42 U.S.C. 15001, et seq.).  The DD Act authorizes the following national grant programs: State Councils on Developmental Disabilities; State Protection and Advocacy Systems for Individuals with Developmental Disabilities' Rights; National Network of University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities, Education, Research, and Service; and Projects of National Significance.  ADD is responsible for administering these grant programs.  Councils serve as their state authority on systems that support individuals with developmental disabilities. Councils identify systemic needs, and promote public and social policy that addresses those needs and supports full participation of individuals with developmental disabilities in their communities.   Councils achieve this purpose by conducting and supporting advocacy, capacity building and systemic change activities such as (but not limited to): outreach; training; technical assistance; supporting and educating communities; collaboration and coordination with state agencies, related councils, committees, and programs; barrier elimination and access and use of community services; coalition development and citizen participation; informing policymakers; and time-limited demonstrations of new approaches to services and supports.  The goal of this assistance is to improve program performance, statutory compliance, and program outcomes across the national network of State Councils.  This contract will enable training and technical assistance to the Councils in support of their advocacy, capacity building and systemic change activities.  The training and technical assistance provided under this contract covers a wide array of activities, including training, consultation, information exchange and dissemination, promotion of best practices, and capacity building.  The National Association of Councils on Developmental Disabilities is a national, member-driven organization consisting of 55 State and Territorial Councils.  NACDD places high value on meaningful participation and contribution by Council members and staff of all Member Councils.  NACDD advocates and continually works towards positive system change on behalf of individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.  NACDD, as the representative of the diverse interests of its Council members, is the national voice of the Councils on Developmental Disabilities.  Its purpose is to support Councils in implementing the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act and in promoting the interests and rights of people with developmental disabilities and their families.
For training and technical assistance to be relevant to the State Councils, it is necessary to have an entity with the in depth knowledge and understanding of their operations and needs.  NACDD was established in 2002 to bring together the two organizations that previously supported DD Councils, Consortium of Developmental Disabilities Councils and National Association of Developmental Disabilities Councils.  Extensive work on behalf of both organizations resulted in the single national organization of NACDD and the combining of the resources of the two separate organizations.  This unique set of resources brings well qualified staff, as well as leadership in the public policy arena, to the membership Councils.  With the connections to the State Councils, NACDD is uniquely positioned to provide training and technical assistance under the contract.  There is no other entity with the innate and exclusive ability to provide the appropriate training and technical assistance to the 55 State Councils across the United States and territories.  Vendors who are interested in this acquisition should submit a statement of capabilities including detailed documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government’s requirements.  The statement of capabilities must specifically demonstrate the following: 1. Experience in providing training and technical assistance to the national network of State Councils; 2. Experience in conducting workshops, conferences, and technical assistance site visits to State Councils; and 3. Ability to provide staff that has proven successful academic and professional work experiences in the field of developmental and other significant disabilities; proven ability to direct and mange projects of this magnitude including accounting/bookkeeping; proven experience in providing and coordinating training and technical assistance activities; and proven experience in managing contracts or programs for training and technical assistance as a project director.  Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a sole source to NACDD.  Responses must be submitted within 45 days from the date of publication of this notice. No solicitation is available.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), INVITATION FOR BID (IFB), REQUEST FOR QUOTES (RFQ), REQUEST FOR APPLICATION (RFA) OR AN ANNOUNCEMNT OF A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT ASSUME THE GOVERNMENT WILL AWARD A CONTRACT OR PROCEED WITH ANY OF THE ABOVE SOLICITATIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THIS NOTICE IS ONLY FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Secretary, Departmental Appeals Board is seeking capabilities statements from organizations with the core competency to provide electronic case filing and management systems. The NAICS Code is 541512 and the size standard is $21.0 M.  Federal and state courts and administrative agencies nationwide are in the midst of implementing electronic case filing and management systems (e-file systems) that permit litigants to file pleadings, briefs, and other case records with the courts and agencies via the Internet. The Departmental Appeals Board (DAB), including its Appellate Division (the Board) and Civil Remedies Division (CRD), have jurisdiction to decide many types of cases that arise under the Social Security Act and other federal statutes.  The Board provides de novo review of certain types of final decisions of HHS operating components and appellate review of certain types of administrative law judge (ALJ) decisions, which may be appealed by either party.  Approximately 5600 to 9000 documents are filed with the Board and CRD annually.  Approximately 1100 to 1400 orders, rulings, or decisions are issued annually by the Board and the ALJs.  The DAB recognizes that it is desirable and important to implement an e-file system to ensure that the parties who appear in litigation before the Board and ALJs receive the benefits such a system provide including better access and reduction of the time associated with adjudication of cases. The e-system anticipated will be a publically accessible web-based process and/or system that will: (1) allow parties to electronically file (e-File) documents at the DAB; (2) allow parties to electronically serve (e-Service) copies of filed documents upon other parties to the same case; and (3) allow the Board and ALJs to electronically issue (e-Issuance) rulings, orders, decisions.   Possible deliverables include: (1) a publically accessible web portal through which: (a)  non-federal parties may request a hearing by an ALJ or parties may request review by the Board; and (b) parties may file with the CRD or Board, pleadings, briefs, responses, or similar documents including attachments; (2) a publically accessible web portal through which parties may effect service upon other parties to the same action; (3) a publically accessible web portal through which the ALJs and Board may issue rulings, orders, and decisions to all parties to a case; and (4) web-based training for using the system available for federal and non-federal parties and DAB staff, in the form of a tutorial and help screens and on-site training for DAB staff in Washington, D.C. The capability statement should address the ability to accomplish all the following requirements: (1) a publicly accessible web portal, that is accessible 24/7/365 except for reasonable periods for maintenance (limited to 0300 through 0600 EST) with a toll free number staffed by the Contractor that parties may call for assistance.  (2) web portal with an Aopen platform@ hosted on secure, high-speed, managed internet server with at least one redundant system to ensure continuity of operations at a location remote from the Contractor=s primary work-site; (3) web portal must be  accessible from any computer with internet connectivity that uses any publicly available operating system and must be able to accept a variety of common formats, including  Adobe Portable Document Format, WordPerfect, Word and other Microsoft formats, or ASCII.  (4) The Contractor will provide such software as is necessary to ensure that DAB staff can: receive, review, accept, or reject requests for hearing or appeal received through the web portal and documents submitted for filing through the web portal; (5) Electronic transmission of documents to the DAB will be accomplished in no more than 4 hours after receipt through the web portal; and parties will be notified of the availability of documents via link or retransmission of documents no more than 4 hours after receipt through the web portal. (6) The DAB e-System will be searchable by case number, document type, party, date of filing, and will allow full-text searches within all documents with the same case number. The anticipated contract will be issued at no cost to the Government. Contractor performance will be financed by fees collected from site users by the Contractor. Interested contractors possessing ALL of the required capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a cover letter along with a capability statement not to exceed 10 pages demonstrating the ability to perform ALL aspects of the effort described therein. Responses must include the following: name and address of the firm, named central point of contact along with email address; DUNS number; any applicable commercial price list(s); size of business, including average annual revenues for the past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are a large, small, small-disadvantaged, 8(a) HUBZone, woman-owned, historically black college or university and/or minority service institute, number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners; list of customers covering the past five years; and additional documentation such as company literature and brochures. If this additional documentation supports the required capabilities it is incumbent to address this reference in the cover letter or other area of the capability statement and indicate specifically how it addresses the capabilities sought. A mere referenced website is unacceptable for purposes of this announcement and will not be considered or reviewed. Capability statements must be submitted via email to pscacquisitions@psc.gov, to the attention of Jonathan Hamlet and referencing this announcement number. No hand-delivered or by-mail copies shall be accepted under any circumstances. Responses are due no later than 12:00 PM Eastern Time, May 11, 2006.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Jo Ann Lawless, Contract Specialist,  843-218-5246
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems, Charleston (SPAWAR Charleston) is soliciting information for the purpose of identifying potential vendors for AM/FM transceivers meeting ALL of the general requirements identified in the specifications detailed in Attachment 1.  In support of Naval air traffic control (ATC) facilities world wide, Naval Aviation Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) and Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) have equipped Navy and Marine Corps Air Stations with modern radios, including single-channel transmitters and receivers and multi-mode transceivers for both backup and emergency use.  NAVAIRSYSCOM and OPNAV have recently undertaken replacement of obsolescent GRT/GRR and URC systems. The purpose of this Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Charleston (SSCC) sources sought synopsis is to review available and oncoming technology that will meet Naval ATC backup transceiver communication. Such technology should provide low- cost, high-performance, transceivers with upgrade capability that will replace the remaining AN/GRC-171 UHF and AN/GRC-211 transceivers from among Naval ATC inventories.  These radios are used for control tower backup communications in event of remote transmitter or receiver failure, cut cables, or power failure. Through the Next-Generation Air/Ground Communications (NEXCOM) Program, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is addressing the need for enhanced control of traffic via potential use of digital technology solutions and additional VHF channels. FAA may need 300 or more new VHF channels by Year 2010.  To maximize channels, separation will be decreased from 25KHz to 8.33KHz.  A few VHF transceivers are already offered with optional 8.33KHz channel separation. No known proposals are directed toward more narrow UHF channel separation. Oncoming data-link and digital technology may become increasingly important in handling both continental and intercontinental traffic.  Projected benefits include increased controller capacity, reduced pilot deviations, and other enhancements pertaining to free flight.  Data-link is also aimed at addressing language issues as nations expand airline service throughout the world.  Future use of data link by international traffic will likely impact Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facilities (FACSFAC), but is not likely to overly affect other Naval ATC facilities in the near term. The long-term driving force for Naval ATC communication sponsors and acquisition teams is foreseen as the need for low-cost technology that will address operational mode options, data link needs, further increased and flexible channelization, and additional upgrade capacity through the software approach.  However, near-term Naval ATC communication strategy is foreseen as following a general thrust for adequate discrete voice channels, selectable modes of operation, built-in capability across both UHF/VHF spectrums, and upgrade capacity to data-link.  The Navy will continue to rely on analog communications for a significant period, although FAA is currently researching digital communication solutions.  Need for upgrade-capable components, compactness, and greater capacity to select operational modes indicate that current Navy ATC GRC-type transceivers will not meet future demands and that acquisition of high-performance, multi- mode replacement transceivers should be undertaken in the near term. General Requirements:  Potential vendors should only provide information on equipment that meets ALL of the general requirements and specifications detailed in Attachment 1. The requirements are not all-inclusive but reflect a summary. Do not include any documentation or percentages for any company other than your own. This is an analysis of your companyâ€™s abilities and what it can or cannot perform. This notice is for planning purposes only.  It is anticipated that a solicitation will be issued for an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, firm-fixed price, commercial type contract, with delivery orders, base year plus four option years. Firms are invited to submit the appropriate documentation as described above in addition to any literature, brochures, and references necessary to support that they possess the required capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements. Responses shall be submitted to SPAWARSYSCEN Charleston, Code 026JL, P.O. Box 190022, North Charleston, SC 29419-9022, or by e- mail to joann.lawless@navy.mil. Responses must include the following: (1) name and address of firm; (2) size of business, including: average annual revenue for past three years and number of employees; (3) ownership, indicating the following applicable business types: Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), Women-Owned, HUBZone, and/or Veteran-Owned Business; (4) number or years in business; (5) two company points of contact, including: name, title, phone, fax, and e-mail address; (6) DUNS Number (if available); (7) affiliate information, including parent corporation, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime);  (8) the percentage of equipment your company alone can provide (do not include any documentation or percentages for any company other than your own â€“ no subcontractor information); (9) a list of customers for similar equipment provided during the past five years, including the following:  (i) a summary of equipment, (ii) contract number, (iii) contract type, (iv) dollar value for each contract referenced, and (v)  a customer point of contact with phone number (this information is required to verify offerorâ€™s performance; the government may contact any reference for further validation). Responses should be provided in MS Word (.doc) or Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) electronic formats. THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, NOR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Personal Radiation Detector (PRD) Testing at the Nevada Test Site (NTS)
<DESC>: The Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) of the Department of Homeland Security is soliciting manufacturers interested in supplying commercially available gamma-ray PRDs with or without neutron detection capability for an upcoming test campaign focusing on technical performance.  The scheduled tests will characterize PRD performance in field-like conditions using realistic sources, threat representative test objects and operationally relevant scenarios.  The results from these tests will be made available to interested government (Federal, State, and local) officials subject to classification guidelines.

Prior to scenario-based testing, all PRDs will be pre-tested at the test site to validate that the PRDs are compliant with sections 6.4.2.1 and 6.4.2.2 of ANSI standard N42.32 “Performance Criteria for Alarming Personal Radiation Detectors for Homeland Security.”  PRDs that do not meet the requirements in pre-testing will be returned to the manufacturer.

Manufacturers should be aware that equipment may be damaged during testing.  At the conclusion of testing, the equipment will be returned to the manufacturer, C.O.D., in the condition the equipment is in at the conclusion of the testing.  Neither the Department of Homeland Security, nor its agents will be responsible for the condition of the equipment when returned to the manufacturer.  As a condition for participating in this testing program, each manufacturer must agree in advance to hold harmless all of these parties for the condition of the equipment.

The results of these tests may be used as part of a future DNDO procurement effort. The Government is under no obligation to award procurements as a direct result of this effort. 

Additional participation and testing conditions are as follows:

1.	Manufacturers will pay to ship PRDs to and from the NTS.
2.	Interested manufacturers will provide to DHS a minimum of three calibrated units of each PRD to be tested, calibration certificates, complete instruction manuals with operating/set-up instructions and data formats if applicable, a short description of the instrument type, general use and performance (test results if available), a list of specifications, training materials, a packing list, and contact information for a technical representative of the manufacturer.
3.	A comprehensive Radioactive Material and Sealed Radioactive Source tracking program is in place at the Nevada Test Site.  Therefore you must provide advance notice and disclosure regarding any and all radioactive material, including sealed radioactive sources, which may be shipped with or as part of your instrument. 
4.	The instruments must be shipped with optimized working parameters and software packages as no changes to the instrument other than alarm level settings will be permitted during testing. If manufacturers request to have their equipment tested under multiple parameter sets or with a different software package, then the manufacturer will submit more than one set of instruments, one for each set of parameters. However, the government reserves the right to limit the number of PRDs tested.
5.	Modifications to the instruments are not permitted during the testing process.
6.	Manufacturers are not allowed to exchange instruments after the initial submission. If the manufacturer produces a newer model during the testing period this instrument may be tested at a future time.
7.	Any PRD having a wireless capability must have the option to disable that capability in the field or it must be disabled by the manufacturer.
8.	PRDs that have spectroscopic radionuclide identification capability will be subjected to additional tests that address their ability to identify radionuclides in a separate test. 
9.	Two out of the three identical units should be operational for all tests. PRDs that are non-operational or that fail to pass the pre-test will be returned to the manufacturer without further testing.
10.	All testing will be conducted by DHS designated operators.
11.	Subject to classification guidelines, manufacturers will be informed how well their PRD(s) performed.  Test results and user feedback will be provided. However, neither the actual test protocols nor the raw data will be provided to the manufacturer.
12.	PRDs must be received at the NTS no later than 15 business days prior to the beginning of testing (date TBD) and will be shipped within 10 business days after the conclusion of testing.  Only equipment received by the deadline will be tested.
13.	Manufacturers shall NOT send equipment to the NTS without contacting DHS first to execute a Bailment Agreement.  Equipment received without a properly executed Bailment Agreement will be returned C.O.D. to the manufacturer. 
14.	Manufacturers who wish to participate in the program must submit an executed Bailment Agreement by June 15, 2006.  To obtain the Bailment Agreement and detailed shipping and logistics instructions, interested manufacturers must contact Phorsha Peel at phorsha.peel@dhs.gov, (202) 254- 2364. For technical information, contact Daniel Blumenthal at daniel.blumenthal@dhs.gov, (202) 254-6186. For media inquiries contact Jenny Burke at jenny.burke@associates.dhs.gov, (202) 254-6667.

<SUBJECT>--Comprehensive Force Protection Initiative (CFPI)
<DESC>The United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC), in support of the Counter-Rocket Artillery, Mortar (C-RAM) Program Office, is conducting an Industry Day to discuss with industry the potential for immediately-available (defined as acquisition and fielding in 12 months) technological solutions and approaches in support of the Comprehensive Force Protection Initiative (CFPI).  The CFPI concept provides for an integrated, multi-layered 3600 real-time, hemispherical capability to detect , assess/predict, decide, act (proactive & reactive), and recover, against air, ground, Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN), and environmental threats at fixed sites - including forward operating bases (FOB), remote sites, and check point s. PROBLEM STATEMENT:  Forces face a significant threat from insurgents employing a variety of tactics such as Improved Explosive Devices (IED), Vehicle Borne IEDs (VBIED), small arms fires, and indirect fires. Insurgents are becoming more aggressive with att acks against fixed sites. Attacks are complex and executed on multiple avenues of approach using a combination of weapons and tactics.  This problem is exacerbated by a lack of responsive integrated base defense technology.  Most critical are the lack of p erimeter sensors and the ability to command and control prior to and during attacks and to allow reaction forces to respond to decisions based on sensor feeds. WHAT:  The CFPI seeks to improve fixed site protection with an integrated, additive, modular, tailorable, expeditionary system of protective systems that enables configuration of sensor & response system to the environmental & threat target set resulting i n an improved protection in-depth posture for our forces.  The objective is to conserve the force and ensure mission success. HOW:  Protection in-depth means to detect, assess, decide, and act at tactically significant stand-off distances.  Protection in-depth improvements are garnered from integrating doctrine, organizations, training, (DOT) with technologies, sensors and respon ses into a System of System (SoS) approach that provides a layered, integrated, scalable option of actions to prevent or mitigate hostile actions against coalition forces, personnel, resources, facilities.  The SoS provides defensive standoff measures that  tie together point, linear, and area sensors (includes cueing and early warning to the lowest levels) with lethal & non-lethal offensive capabilities. The envisioned SoS provides a means for accomplishing: area detection, alarm reporting, display, and tra cking, remote alarm assessment, computer assisted assessment and predictive analysis.  The SoS provides situational understanding to the commander and his staff to support battle command and staff planning, response and blue force in the area of operations  as required, and graduated responses/scaleable effects to include security forces to defeat threats/hazards. WHY:  Increases a commanders protection capabilities by enabling him to see first, understand first, act first, and finish with an appropriate decisive response.  This integrated system of protection systems allows him to engage targets/hazards out of con tact at the place and time of his choosing with the right level of force, both non-lethal and lethal, and with minimal solider/leader intervention required by the system. Force protection includes the following mission sets: (1) Battle Command of a fixed site force protection System of Systems: Integrated networked battle command system with an integrated common operating picture (COP).   COP will include blue forces, threats and hazards, control measures, geometry of graphics/ overlays, and assets available; Integrated intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities to include long-range acoustic, thermal and visual sensor s both manned and unmanned; Ability of a commander to fight the systems; and ability to conduct predictive analyses and  staff planning functions; (2) Protection from Ground and Direct Fire Threats: Scaleable and integrated perimeter protection measures against ground threats; Positively differentiate, identify, and mark hostile forces under all conditions; Locate and bring  accurate fires or direct ground forces against snipers and level 1 threats; Protect personnel and critical infrastructure against the effects of direct fires (RPG and 12.5mm and below); (3) Protection from Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and unexploded  ordnance (UXO): Detect and assess vehicle, personnel borne or emplaced IEDs and UXOs at a safe standoff distance; Neutralize both vehicle and personnel borne IEDs and UXO at a safe standoff distance; Prevent both vehicle and personnel borne IEDs from detonating within a s afe standoff distance; Mitigate the effects of a detonation on personnel and critical fixed site infrastructure; (4) Protection from Indirect Fire: Capability to detect incoming Rocket, Artillery and Mortar (RAM) fire and quickly warn personnel in danger; Capability to identify fire, intercept hostile fire and neutralize it; Capability to track the incoming RAM fire to determine the location of the hostile firing unit and respond; Capability to protect personnel and critical infrastructure from the effects of all incoming RAM fires; (5)Protection from Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN): Standoff detection of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN)/Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM) vapors and hazards from safe distances; Point detect ion, identification and quantification of CBRN/TIM contamination at low-levels; Rapid and accurate sharing of CBRN information and warning of soldiers of imminent hazards; Protect critical infrastructure and occupants from CBRN contamination; Perform equip ment, facility and mass personnel decontamination; (6)Protection against Intrusions (physical security) and support the commanders ability to influence or control the civilian populace: Prevent unauthorized intrusions into fixed sites by personnel or vehi cles; Non-lethal capability to prevent unnecessary escalation of violence; Protect critical infrastructure against any physical security threat including sabotage and theft; Communicate with, contain and protect the civilian populace; and (7) Protection ag ainst environmental threats; Capability to identify and assess environmental threats during pre-mission and mission planning; Capability to detect environmental threats and assess risks associated with potential and confirmed environmental threats across t he Range of Military Operations (ROMO); Capability to act and recover from environmental hazards having adverse impact on the mission; Capability to act, supporting Stability and Reconstruction Operations (S&RO) related to environmental considerations. The Industry Day will be conducted at the Wyndham Arlington DFW Airport South Hotel, 1500 Convention Center Drive, Arlington, TX on 16 May 2006.  Interested parties may attend either one of two identical sessions conducted at 8:00 a.m. and 1:30 p.m.  Due t o the limited space available for Industry Day and the significant industry interest expected, participation will be limited to no more than three individuals per company.  The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with participation in the In dustry Day.  Due to the sensitive nature of this Industry Day, foreign contractor attendance/participation will not be allowed.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health intends to negotiate with the Research
Triangle Institute,  Research Triangle Park,  NC
for the development of a prototype for a web-enabled and real time analysis system for National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES):
The contractor shall provide but shall not be limited to the following services.
1.  The contractor shall develop a format for obtaining evaluation input from nutritional scientists on the prototype for folate and vitamin B-12.

2.  The contractor shall be responsible for application of the format at a  scientific meeting of nutritionists.

3.  The contractor shall provide a report of the evaluation findings and recommendations for improvements to meet potential user needs.

4.   Shall provide a draft of publication quality manuscript with data tables and statistics generated by the final NOADS prototype illustrating the determination of total usual nutrient intakes from foods and supplements for folate and vitamin B-12 of US adults from NHANES 1999-2000 and 2001-2002.  This draft manuscript shall also include percentile groupings for total usual folate and vitamin B-12 intakes with their respective nutrient status biomarkers.

5.  Shall provide revised manuscript with modifications requested following Office of Dietary Supplements senior staff review and conference call between ODS and contractor.


.
There are two major tasks and eight deliverables for this project:
Task A – Shall provide special Data Analysis and data quality control (QC) tasks.
1.  Shall provide data QC for specific nutrients calcium and fluoride.  The contractor shall verify the location and availability of all intake data on calcium and fluoride from dietary supplements, food and all medications to insure the capture of all intakes of these nutrients.

2.  Shall provide QC on data analyses.  The contractor shall develop a separate analysis of basic supplement intake using those age groups used with previous publications to allow QC on  the data analysis of these variables with previously published information on the same NHANES data sets.  In addition, the contractor shall run a separate frequency distribution on the family income variable and recode each record with a new variable that reflects the frequency distribution break points.

3.  The contractor shall reanalyze the data using the MEC weights to determine prevalence of supplement use.  In addition, the contractor shall obtain a program that uses the CDC charts to identify how each child in the study samples BMI fell based upon age within the current scientifically acceptable weight categories of underweight, risk of underweight, probably a health weight, at risk of being, and overweight, validate the output on a subset of the data, then calculate and create a weight category variable for each child for analyses.

4.   The contractor shall employ a step-wise introduction of those life style variables where the prevalence was statistically significant into an odds ratio model.

5.   Shall develop an ingredient-based coding system for dietary  supplements and prepare a summary for installation on the Office of Dietary Supplements web page.  The contractor  shall expand the explanatory text and development history of the ingredient-based dietary supplement coding system used in these studies into a self-explanatory text for posting on  the ODS website.  This site shall be available to the scientific community so that a unified classification system can be employed by investigators enhancing ability to compare data across studies.

Task B shall provide Special Analysis steps for a manuscript on usual intake.

1.   The contractor shall acquire and format the Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII) to use as second day recall for the Iowa method.  Literature has demonstrated the importance of calculating the variability of intake in order to estimate usual intake.  Since second recall data is not available for the NHANES datasets, the contractor shall obtain and appropriately program suitable data from the CSFII data to use as the second recall to estimate usual intake of food.

2.   The contractor shall develop, discuss with ODS and calculate intake of nutrients from breast milk for all infants who consume breast milk; add this analysis into the usual intake model.    Shall develop an algorithm to estimate the nutrient intake of these infants from breast milk, discuss it with ODS and then employ it using the Iowa method to calculate usual intake in these infants.

3.   The contractor shall review all of its programming code, make it user friendly and provide instructions so other statisticians could employ the same code to do a comparison analysis of the data from both publications.

This proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit  and negotiate with only one source.  Interested parties may identify their interest  and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.

However, all quotes received within ten days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government .  A determination by the Government  not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition requirement  based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received  will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NO: GSWR060105 - COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION DATE: April 26, 2006 CLOSING DATE: May 10, 2006 This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; this is a Request for Quotes and a separate solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation document and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-08. This acquisition is 100% set aside for small business concerns. The associated NAICS code is 561410, small business size standard is $6.5 million. The U.S. Geological Survey/California Bay Delta Authority office located at 650 Capitol Mall in Sacramento, CA has identified a requirement for technical editor services for the on-line technical journal 'San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science' (SFEWS) in support of the CALFED science program as described in the statement of work below: STATEMENT OF WORK FOR TECHNICAL EDITOR OF THE  SAN FRANCISCO ESTUARY AND WATERSHED SCIENCE JOURNAL I. INTRODUCTION 	The US Geological Survey requires the services of a Technical Editor (TE) for the on-line technical journal San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science (SFEWS), in support of the CALFED Science Program. II. BACKGROUND The contractor (TE) will work with the three co-editors in chief of SFEWS (http://www.estuaryandwatershedscience.org) to produce issues of the journal by the end of December 2006.  The journal is sponsored by the CALFED Bay-Delta Program to make peer-reviewed information from all program elements widely available to program participants and stakeholders.  The contractor will work closely with the Berkeley Electronic Press and its consultants to format edited articles for publication.   The contractor will conduct the bulk of this work at a remote location by use of telephone, email and the journal website.  The contractor will furnish all property for this work.  As needed, limited travel may be available to meet with Berkeley Electronic Press and its consultants for training in use of their special formatting procedures.   Upon issuance of a purchase order to the TE, several papers will be ready for editing and formatting with the expectation that a journal will be issued within about one month.  Subsequently the TE will likely edit and format papers as soon as they approved for publication by the co-editors in chief.  Alternately the TE may chose to save the papers and devote 2-3 weeks at a time to edit and format the papers and send them to the corresponding authors as galley proofs for final review.  The choice of approach will be at the discretion of the TE as long as the journal issues are released in a timely manner.   III. SCOPE In consultation with the chief editors, the TE will plan, develop, edit, update, and proof online content.  The TE will copy edit and lay out accepted manuscripts in final format.  Working directly with authors, the TE will lay out the figures to ensure that they are faithfully reproduced in the journal and they are formatted to convey the maximum information to the reader. The TE will also provide guidance and technical assistance to authors, reviewers and others involved in online review and editorial production processes. After a paper is approved for publication, edited and formatted, the TE will send the paper to the corresponding author as a galley proof.  The author will submit any final minor changes to the editor and the changes will be made before uploading the paper for publication. The TE will communicate effectively with website technical support staff, submitting authors, editors-in-chief, and reviewers to develop, revise and deliver issues in a timely manner. As appropriate, the TE will work with the co-editors in chief and the Berkeley Electronic Press to suggest and implement changes in the Guide to Authors and the electronic manuscript submittal, review and decision process.  The TE will ensure high editorial standards of published content. The SFEWS is a start up journal, thus the work flow can not be completely defined at this time.  Based on the number of articles currently received, it is anticipated that there will be three issues of the journal and one monograph released before the end of 2006.  The time investment for each product is estimated to be 100 hours.   IV. QUALIFICATIONS Minimum Qualifications "	Two years of experience as a proofreader, copy editor, or editorial experience in a science publishing environment "	Proficient in spoken and written English "	Bachelor's degree "	Resourceful, with ability to work independently with minimal supervision in a team environment "	Organizational ability; meticulous accuracy and attention to detail "	Superior interpersonal skills; able to correspond effectively with subject matter experts "	Experience with word processing, spreadsheet, and layout software "	Proficient with layout software such as Adobe InDesign or FrameMaker "	Good understanding of HTML and familiarity with online publishing environment "	Skilled use of the Internet and personal computers. Desired Qualifications "	Two years' project or editorial management experience "	An abiding interest in science, and the communication of science, especially publishing scholarly work "	Bachelor's degree   "	Knowledge of Council of Biology Editors' Scientific Style and Format V. DELIVERABLES 	The deliverables under any order will consist of the edited, formatted and uploaded issues for the electronic journal.  Upon completion of each product, the TE may invoice for hours worked. VI. TRAVEL The offer shall include in their pricing a separate line item of  $2,000 for travel and per diem to attend meetings with the co-editors in chief, the associate editors (at the October 2006 CALFED Science Conference) and staff and consultants of the Berkeley Electronic Press.  Such travel shall be approved by the USGS technical liaison as requested by the editors in chief.   It is requested that the offer submit the number of hours it shall take to complete the services requested and their hourly rate.  In addition, the offeror shall submit information showing that they meet or exceed the 'Qualifications' portion of the statement of work.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded.

Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the National Stock Number, Nomenclature, Part Number and Unit Price.   NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.   It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.   The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.   Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.   To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).   Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

 Acceptance and Inspection Criteria

1.  Visual-Physical check at NIST laboratory for adherence to specifications.
2.  Performance check at NIST laboratory for adherence to performance specifications.  The tests will be performed as soon as the instrument is ready, as determined by the contractor, and may be witnessed by the contractor.  They will involve a total of 2 samples: one will be run to evaluate SPR spectroscopy and SPR imaging, the other will be run to evaluate SPR fluorescence spectroscopy and SPR fluorescence microscopy.  For each sample, the signal stability will be evaluated for 1 hour before adding the analyte, 1 hour after the adsorption reaches steady state, and 1 hour after rinsing back to pure buffer. 
3. The item must operate in 4 measurement modes: 1) SPR spectroscopy, 2) SPR imaging, 3) SPR fluorescence spectroscopy, 4) SPR fluorescence microscopy.  Modes 1) and 3) can be performed by integrating the total or partial image signal obtained from 2) and 4).  

1) SPR Spectroscopy:
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) reflectivity measurements are surface-sensitive, spectroscopic methods that can be used to characterize the thickness and/or index of refraction of ultrathin organic and biopolymer films at noble metal (Au, Ag, Cu) surfaces.  SPR spectroscopy can be characterized by three primary capabilities: (i) with SPR spectroscopy the kinetics of adsorption for organic molecules, biomolecules, or colloidal particles can be measured in real time, (ii) the adsorption of unlabeled analyte (no fluorescent or radiological tags) to the surface can be monitored, and (iii) SPR has a high degree of surface sensitivity that allows weakly bound interactions to be monitored in the presence of excess solution species (ability to perform classic Langmuir isotherm experiments).  Using samples we provide, the contractor should also be able to demonstrate (i) a noise floor of 0.54 microRIU = 0.40 RU = 0.000040 deg. (Raw Data RMS      Noise = 1.2 microRIU = 0.85 RU = 0.000085 deg), and (ii) baseline stability with a maximum drift of 5 microRIU/hour [1 microRIU = 0.73 RU = 0.000073 Deg] (iii) a maximum time resolution of at least 2 data points per second.

2) SPR Imaging:
SPR imaging is based on the same technical concept as SPR spectroscopy except the photodetector is replaced with a CCD camera.  The amount of adsorption is therefore measured as a function of position in two dimensions, allowing one to look at patterned substrates, or heterogeneous surfaces.  An important component of SPR imaging is the ability to convert the data, which is archived as a movie, into SPR spectroscopy plots by plotting the integrated signal from a user-selected area of the image as a function of time.
		
3) SPR Fluorescence Spectroscopy:
In contrast to SPR spectroscopy, SPR Fluorescence Spectroscopy does not measure the intensity of the light reflected from the back of the noble metal film.  Instead, the evanescent light wave that passes through the reflecting film is used to excite fluorescence from either quantum dots or fluorescent molecules in close proximity to the film.  The camera is therefore placed above the sample (same side as aqueous solution) rather than behind it.  The number of photons are then counted so that binding to the surface is monitored in terms of fluorescence intensity.  Once it is demonstrated that the CCD camera has an absolute proportionality between image signal and intensity, the total signal can then be calibrated with the SPR spectroscopy data, which is obtained simultaneously as described in 1), to measure the amount (thickness or mass) of the fluorescently-labeled material that has adsorbed to the surface.  The maximum time resolution should be at least 1 data point per second in order to monitor the kinetics of binding for both fluorescently-labeled and unlabeled material.

	4) SPR-Assisted Fluorescence Microscopy:
Except for the direction of the incoming light, the technique is very similar to conventional fluorescence microscopy.  It allows one to capture micrographs of the fluorescently-labeled material that is in close proximity to the noble metal film.  One can also capture movies with the CCD camera and convert the data into SPR Fluorescence Spectroscopy plots by plotting the integrated signal from a user-selected area of the image as a function of time.  In principle, one could inspect patterned surfaces or surfaces with chemistry gradients and collect SPR Fluorescence Spectroscopy plots from any part of the image.  This data is then compared with the SPR imaging signal to calibrate the data and to compare the kinetics of adsorption of fluorescently-labeled material with that of the unlabeled material.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the request for quote (RFQ) for the required supplies and services as required by solicitation N00189-06-T-0230.  Please notify FISC Norfolk for necessary attachment.  
Amendment 0001
The purpose of this AMENDMENT 0001 is to answer the following questions:
1.  The tentative anchorage is N17 08 / W 061 54 and it is 3 miles from fleet landing. If it does move it will not substantially change the ferry trip.
2.  As far as the provisions barge, we’re looking for a barge that can be loaded with pallets of material. If a forklift can be provided on the barge, it’ll help get the pallets into cargo nets for us to lift and load through the EL 4 doors in the hangar bay. We’re also looking for some bodies to handle the material from barge (so that our folks don’t have to get down onto the barge to load the ship). Not sure how the provisions would come, they would be provided from a local vendor . . . usually delivered palletized and shrink wrapped. We’d only by looking at about 15-20 pallets max.

The trap should also feature "snap in" legs for easy field replacement and all of the trap components should be fully interchangeable with older trap versions of the trap.
