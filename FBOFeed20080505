<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is soliciting proposals on a full and open competition basis to perform the Maintenance and Fielding of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) Support ? Household Components (HC).  The Contractor will be responsible for collecting editing and inputting data collected from Households. The Contractor will also be responsible for survey weight and estimation variable development and construction as well as analytic file development, including documentation and codebooks. The contract will be performance based for an initial period of performance of three and one-half years with three three-year options and four options for product delivery, under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541720. 
The primary objective of the MEPS HC is to provide high quality data that can be used to produce both point estimates as well as distributional estimates of health care use, medical expenditures, health insurance status and sources of payment for medical care.  In addition, the MEPS HC is designed to produce measures of health care quality associated with several high prevalence conditions.  The health care services use, medical expenditures, and health insurance data can also be linked to the demographic, employment, economic, and health status of survey participants.  The longitudinal feature of the MEPS HC permits analyses of transitions in health insurance coverage, health status, and other characteristics over a two year period. Offerors must meet requirements of the Pro-Children Act of 1994, Buy American Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Privacy Act, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), federal policy for the protection of human research subjects (45CFR46) which will include an Institutional Review Board (IRB) review, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. 

Tasks will revolve around the MEPS-HC which collects detailed information on health care use and payment for health care services from a nationally representative sample of the U.S. civilian non-institutionalized population.  In the MEPS HC, data are collected for each new sample panel of households to cover a two-year period, and a new panel is started each year.  To produce health care estimates for a calendar year, data are combined across two distinct nationally representative MEPS HC samples.  More specifically, annual estimates are based on data from the first year of a current panel combined with data from the second year of a previous year?s panel.

Offerors must demonstrate in their proposal they possess expertise in data collection (computer assisted and paper and pencil), statistical and analytical editing and imputation, survey weight and estimation variable development and construction, as well as analytical file development and documentation.  Offerors must possess and demonstrate the following capabilities:  a) sample implementation and documentation; b) development of weights and variables for variance estimation; c) development of sampling unit data (geo-coding); d) development of materials and CAPI maintenance; e) interviewer recruitment and training for Round 1, Round 2, Round 3, Round 4, and  Round 5; f) data collection for Round 1, Round  2, Round 3, Round 4, and Round 5; g) Spanish interviewer training and materials development; h) data processing; i) development of security plan; j) between round processing; k) forms control and receipt; l) data entry; m) data coding; and n) preparation and delivery of analytic files including archival versions of the full operational database, and point-in-time, full year use, full year use and expenditure, event, condition, jobs and a appendix files.  Offeror?s proposals must also demonstrate their understanding and knowledge of how to develop an overall plan for coordinating deliverables including data files and materials between the HC and MPC (Medical Provider Component ? to be a separate requirement) contractors, particularly those occurring concurrently or in a linked manner; integration of CAPI applications, post data collection processing, and analytic editing and imputation tasks; the statistical and substantive soundness of the data editing and imputation techniques proposed; the soundness of proposed weighting and variance estimation strategies and strategies to maximize survey response and minimize non-response bias; and  the soundness of the data management plan.  Examples of all of the above will be requested in the resultant RFP.   

The MEPS-HC is to be comprised of core staff of seasoned professionals with education and experience in areas such as data collection (computer assisted and paper questionnaires) from household respondents of demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical services, charges and sources of payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment information.  In addition, it is anticipated that offerors proposal will demonstrate they have the expertise and experience in developing analytic files, including documentation of public use files, as well as survey weight and variance estimation development and construction, and analytical and statistical data editing and imputation. A PMI-certified Project Manager is required as well as demonstrated ability to provide EVM information. In the event that the MEPS core staff does not include particular expertise needed to accomplish a particular task, the contractor must demonstrate their capability to obtain such expertise through consultants and/or subcontracts.  Subcontracting to meet the DHHS? socio economic goals must be included in offeror?s proposals. Potential offerors are encouraged to visit the MEPS website at www.meps.ahrq.gov .  Specific files and reports to assist understanding of the requirement will be available via CD ROM, after the solicitation is issued. Instructions will be in the solicitation.

In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQ?s site at www.ahrq.gov. Once in AHRQ?s homepage go to ?Funding Opportunities,? then to ?Contracts,? and then to ?Request for Proposal (RFP).?  It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and to monitor this site for any subsequent amendments.  It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on/about December 19, 2007 with proposals due February 21, 2008.

There is no other certified manufacturer affiliated with CISCO. CISCO not only has the ITCCB approval, but, has provided excellent support in the past and is familiar with the Department requirements. Research has been conducted and it has been determined that acquiring the CISCO products and services is the most cost effective means to meet the Departments requirements for maintenance and technical support. There are no other manufacturers that will support this requirement and procuring other brands of equipment will result in Network incompatibilities and could result in extended outages.<BR><BR>

<CONTACT>Jennifer Lohmeier, Phone 301-975-8173, Fax 301-975-6273, Email jennifer.lohmeier@nist.gov - Todd D Hill, Phone 301-975-8802, Email todd.hill@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Bruker Biospin Corporation, of Billerica, Massachusetts, for the acquisition of a Multinuclear Broadband Probe and Automated Sample Changer to be used in the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) facility at the Hollings Marine Laboratory in Charleston, South Carolina.  


BACKGROUND
The required probe is for observation of NMR visible nuclei between the frequency of Phosporus-31 and Silver-109, with the possibility of observation of a few nuclei below this frequency range which will be installed on an existing Bruker Biospin Nuclear Magnetic resonance (NMR) instrument at 800 Megahertz (MHz).  The required probe must work with the control electronics of the existing equipment, including probe identification (PICS), temperature control stability (BTO), automated tuning and matching (ATM) and an actively shielded z-gradient coil. 

The required robotic sample changing device shall provide the capability of automated sample handling and data collection. This device shall be connected and interoperate with an existing NMR instrument and it must interface properly with the existing equipment. The sample changer must be under software control from the NMR instrument to properly sequence and handle samples. This involves complex software, electrical and mechanical interconnections. 

The required device must interoperate with Bruker TopSpin software, which allow a user to automatically perform experiments on up to 120 samples, allow random sequencing of samples and have the capability through additional add-on accessories (not being procured at this time) for positive sample identification and sample temperature control.

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.

(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

Sole source determination is based on the need for the required probe and sample changer to interface with existing equipment.  The existing warranty on the existing equipment will become void if another Manufacturer’s probe and sample changer were to be purchased.  Bruker Biospin Corporation is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required Multinuclear Broadband Probe and Automated Sample Changer.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by May 20, 2008 will be considered by the Government.

<SUBJECT>Customization and Presentation of Duke Environmental Leadership (DEL) Program Training Courses
<SOLNBR>FSM-08-008
<RESPDATE>052008
<CONTACT>Anthony Briggs, Phone 301-415-6525, Email anthony.briggs@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source contractual agreement with Duke University for the development and presentation of a customized version of the Duke University’s implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) training course to NRC staff.  The coures shall consist of customized versions of various Duke Environmental Leadership (DEL) Program training courses (discussed in more detail below). The period of performance for this training is one (1) year with four (4) one-year options. The authority for negotiating on a sole source basis with Duke University is made under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541620 (Environmental Consulting Services).  Duke University co-sponsors with the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) a Duke Environmental Leadership Program (DEL) that offers a Certificate in NEPA.  The CEQ coordinates federal environmental efforts and works closely with agencies and other offices of the White House for development of environmental policy and initiatives. The course is specifically designed for mid-level and senior project managers who work to streamline the environmental permitting process for federal facilities and federal regulatory activities; and to prepare and review environmental assessments, environmental impact statements, and other NEPA analyses. The course provides the necessary tools to address the environmental effects of agency actions and to ensure that environmental impact analyses are substantively and procedurally accurate. Course instruction aids students in determining the proper level of environmental analysis documentation to fully record and disclose to the public.  While there are other entities who provide training on NEPA, CEQ does not co-sponsor a same or similar NEPA training program with any other entity. Due to the critical role that CEQ plays with respect to NEPA activities, Duke University’s training course co-sponsored by CEQ would be appropriate for use by a federal regulatory agency in the area of environmental reviews under NEPA.  This notice of intent is neither a request for quotes nor a solicitation of offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates an ability to meet the NRC’s needs.  Detailed capabilities must be submitted to Anthony Briggs, Contract Specialist, no later than fifteen (15) calendar days from the date this announcement appears in Federal Business Opportunities, at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Division of Contracts, Mail Stop T-7I2, Washington, DC 20555. Questions may be submitted to Mr. Briggs at (301) 415-6525. The Government will not reimburse interested parties for any cost associated with responding to this presolicitation announcement.  No request for proposal/quotation document is available. Telephonic responses and responses providing insufficient information for evaluation by the NRC will not be considered.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR
Solicitation Number:  GS06P08GYC0011
National Nuclear Security Administration Kansas City Lease
14500 Botts Road, Kansas City, Missouri

A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held on or about May 28, 2008.

This solicitation is set aside for exclusive small business participation, in accordance with Acquisition letter V-05-08, Supplement Number 6.  The NAICS code is 236620, and the small business size standard is $31,000,000.  Offers received from business concerns that do not qualify as a small business concern shall be considered nonresponsive and shall be rejected.  

The purpose of this source selection procurement is to select a Construction Manager as Agent (CMa) contractor for GSA’s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Kansas City Lease at 14500 Botts Road, Kansas City, Missouri.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include a general scope of work, specifications and drawings, the solicitation provisions, the proposal submittal requirements and the evaluation factors.  The RFP will be issued on or about May 20, 2008.  Estimated cost range for the base year is $1,000,000 -- $4,000,000. The option to exercise is a unilateral right of the Government based upon contractor’s performance.  Award is expected to be made in September 2008 for the base year.  A preference will be given to those firms having an existing CMa services contracting office in the Kansas City Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) and such office shall have been in operation as of the date of this notice.  The SMSA includes the Kansas counties of Franklin, Johnson, Leavenworth, Linn, Miami, and Wyandotte; and the Missouri counties of Bates, Caldwell, Cass, Clay, Clinton, Jackson, Lafayette, Platte, and Ray. Any contractors that have provided any design services for the NNSA Kansas City Lease or are working with or for the Developer/Lessor or its subcontractors will not be allowed to compete for this proposed contract.

GSA has selected a site for the build to suit lease project. The building will have a gross area of approximately 1,500,000 sq ft of which 400,000 sq ft shall be used for office space, 900,000 sq ft shall be used for manufacturing space, and 200,000 sq ft shall be used for warehouse/storage.  The building construction will be performed in two phases: building shell phase and tenant improvement phase. All areas will be climate controlled with some manufacturing spaces required to meet certain clean room and/or low humidity specifications. There will be approximately 2900 surface parking stalls for employees and visitors. The entire building will be sprinkler protected. Heating, cooling, and air change requirements will vary depending on the type of space. GSA will manage the Lessor/Developers performance of the lease requirements.  The selected CMa will be responsible for the following activities, which are not limited to:  design; procurement; construction; and post-construction phase services.  Design phase services include design reviews of the drawings and specifications; verification that the completed design complies with GSA standards, applicable codes, and is within the scope of work identified for the project.  Construction phase services include inspection of work performed by the general contractor for conformity with contract requirements; monitoring, review and approval of submittals required by the contract documents; monitoring the budget for the entire project to maintain an accurate cost picture of the project; providing reports comparing budgeted costs with current cost estimates; and reviewing Lessors cost estimates to ensure the project can be completed with available funds.  This phase also includes review and monitoring of the schedule; conducting meetings and maintaining meeting minutes; preparing reports; notifying GSA of problems and issues that arise; and providing independent cost estimates for lease contract modifications.  Post-construction phase services include deficiencies and omissions inspections; and support for other post-construction phase activities. 

GSA anticipates the award of a negotiated firm fixed price contract using source selection procedures to obtain the greatest value for the Government.  The Government intends to use the trade-off process in selecting the contractor.  The trade-off process is a method of evaluating technical qualification factors specified in the solicitation, and then price, with the goal being to select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government in terms of both technical qualifications and price.  For this procurement, technical qualifications are substantially more important than price.  Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage one will consist of technical evaluations.  Stage two will consist of price evaluations.  Offerors must submit their technical proposals and price proposals at the same time, in separate packages.  Technical Experience and proposals will be evaluated using the following technical factors, in order of importance:  1) Past Performance and Experience of the Firm; 2) Qualifications of Proposed Personnel; 3) Continuity and 4) Management and Technical Approach.   Proposals will first be evaluated for technical qualifications.  After all proposals have been evaluated for technical qualifications, price proposals will be opened and separately evaluated.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  The price factor is not as important as the technical evaluation factors.  However, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.  Joint ventures or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality service.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals and establish a competitive range if necessary.  The evaluation team will comply with the GSA Source Selection Policy with respect to nondisclosure, conflict of interest, safeguarding of data and any other regulatory or statutory requirement therein stated or referenced.  Award of a contract will be contingent upon funding approval.   

The solicitation will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps).  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  FedBizOpps.gov is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.  It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from your company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.

Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status. 

Proposals are due at GSA on June 19, 2008, at 10:00 AM Central Time.

The list of plan holders will be based only on those requesting the proposal documents via FedBizOpps (see above) through the link contained in this announcement.  Those requesting specifications must first register at www.ccr.gov.  Contact Lisa M. Hancock, Contracting Officer, for questions concerning this announcement at 816-823-4906 or fax her at 816-823-5523.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, Doug Benton, at Douglas.Benton@gsa.gov, or fax at (816) 823-5906.

<DESC>The Project consists of the installation of an inlet structure hydraulic dredging, and an mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) wall in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay to provide tidal flow to the wetland cell 1A.  We feel that contract needs the resources of a larger contractor that has the experience with building on the shorelines and the flexibility in adapting to island contruction.  For Poplar island, I lead the way in using 8A contractors and will continue to do so where appropriate.  The risk of these structures failing must be reduced by using a contractor who is highly experienced, highly flexible and familiar with working in the island/water environment.

A-E services are required to provide the full spectrum of design disciplines on all or portions of complete Civil and Military works projects, which may include construction phase services.  Projects will primarily be located within the South Pacific Division’s military boundaries of CA, NV, UT and AZ and the civil works boundaries of CA, NV, AZ, UT, and portions of OR, ID, CO and WY.  The contracts may also be used by other Districts within South Pacific Division (Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Albuquerque Districts) to encompass the entire South Pacific Division geographical area of responsibility.  Use of the contracts outside the above areas of responsibility is subject to the review and approval of the contracting officer.  This work will include all Architectural-Engineering (A-E) and related services necessary to complete the assigned task orders for studies and designs.  A specific scope of work and services will be issued with each task order. This procurement will be conducted under FSC Code: C219; SIC Code: 8712; and North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541310.  The size standard for this code is $4,500,000.  To be considered a Small Business under this NAICS Code, the respondent’s average revenue for the last three fiscal years cannot be more than $4,500,000.  This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.  One contract will be negotiated and will be awarded within one year after the required response date to this announcement.  A Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be negotiated and is anticipated to be awarded in September 2008.  The contract will be for a maximum of a one-year base period from the date of award and will contain options to extend four (4) additional one-year periods.  The contract amount for the base period and any option will not exceed $1,000,000 for each period.  The total contract amount shall not exceed $5,000,000.  Individual task orders shall not exceed the annual contract amount.  The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.  At the discretion of the Government, the option years may be exercised early if the Total Estimated Price is exhausted or nearly exhausted.  If the option is exercised prior to the one-year anniversary of the contract award date, or the anniversary of exercising an option, the new option year rates will take effect on the anniversary date of the contract period.  If the Total Estimated Price of the base year or any option year is not awarded within that year’s 12-month performance period and the Government has elected to exercise a subsequent option year, the remaining unused dollar amount may be added on to the Total Estimated Price of the option period being exercised.  At the discretion of the Government, if an option year is exercised early and unused capacity is rolled over, the Government may extend the period of service to coincide with the anniversary date of that period.  The minimum guarantee for the base year of the contract will be $20,000.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be a least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, as determined relative to the employees office location (not the location of the work).  At lease 50 percent of the cost of contract performance must be performed by the small business firm selected for award in accordance with FAR 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting.  To be eligible for contract award a firm or joint venture must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the Internet Site at http://www.bpn.gov/CCRINQ or by contacting the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414 and complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov. Contractor Performance Evaluations: In accordance with the provisions of Subpart 36.604 (Performance Evaluation) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), A-E contractor’s performance shall be evaluated throughout the performance of the contract.  The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) follows the procedures outlined in Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7 to fulfill this FAR requirement.  For A-E contracts awarded at or above $30,000,000, the USACE will evaluate contractor’s performance and prepare a performance report using the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS), which is now a web-based system.  After an evaluation (interim or final) is written up by the USACE, the contractor will have the ability to access, review and comment on the evaluation for a period of 30 days.  Accessing and using ACASS requires specific software, called PKI certification, which is installed on the users computer.  The certification is a Department of Defense requirement and was implemented to provide security in electronic transactions.  The certification software could cost approximately $110-$125 per certificate per year and is purchased from an External Certificate Authorities (ECA) vendor.  Current information about the PKI certification process and for contacting vendors can be found on the web site at http://www.cpars.navy.mil/. If the Contractor wishes to participate in the performance evaluation process, access to CCASS and PKI certification is the sole responsibility of the Contractor.  The Secretary of the Army’s Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) requirement will be incorporated into this contract.  The annual CMR requirement will apply to each task order which is funded by Army dollars; supports an Army mission; which benefits or supports any Army military, civilian, or contractor personnel; or when the Army is the executive agency for the mission being supported.  The A-E will be allowed to include their costs for compliance with the CMR requirement as a line item in their price proposal for each task order subject to the CMR requirement.  Further information is available at https://cmra.army.mil.

<p>The USAF Academy has a requirement for a ground-based fast-tracking/steering telescope (FTT) and mount for low earth orbit (LEO) satellite imaging, as well as classical astronomy and astrophysics applications. The telescope and mount will be installed, tested and operated in this government provided facility, located in the Cadet Area of USAFA (Colorado Springs, CO). It is the government's intent to have one primary contractor, who will oversee the design and construction of the telescope and mount. The government is pursuing separate avenues to provide a facility to house the telescope, to include the enclosure, dome, pier and appropriate power and communications capabilities.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to construct the fast steering mount and Optical Tube Assembly (OTA) to include primary mirror support (cell), truss, secondary mirror and assembly, tertiary mirror and assembly, and two Nasmyth-style instrument platforms, together with the control software and electronics necessary to fully operate this system. In addition, the successful offeror will be required to fully interface the telescope control system with the government furnished facility, to include design parameters for the facility to insure operability of the OTA and mount. The contractor will also be expected to provide operation and maintenance training as well as detailed documentation. The primary contractor will work closely with other contractors as well as the government when installing the telescope, in order to ensure that all specifications are met.<br />At minimum, potential sources are requested to provide the following information:</p>
<p>1. Evidence they have completed similar type of work, including design, construction, and integration of 2 meter class telescopes on schedule and within original budget.</p>
<p>2. Ability to subcontract as necessary to qualified sources, and to oversee such subcontracts. Alternatively, the ability to team with other contractors on the original proposal to accomplish same.</p>
<p>3. Evidence of relevant team expertise, such as qualified optical engineers, software engineers, and mechanical/structural engineers.</p>
<p>4. While the telescope and mount is not envisioned as an operational AF asset, the telescope will be primarily used for satellite imaging and other Space Situational Awareness (SSA) activities. Accordingly, we request evidence of substantial experience (3 years or more) working in these areas, and evidence of awareness of current DoD Space Situational Awareness (SSA) operational requirements.</p>
<p>5. Evidence the potential contractor has engaged in this type of business for over 5 (five) years, has the necessary equipment, personnel, and financial resources to fulfill the requirements of this contract.</p>
<p>6. Demonstration of capability to comply with the Buy American Act.</p>
<p>7. A description and percentage of work most likely to be subcontracted, and what percentage of the subcontracted work small businesses could/would perform. This information will be used to establish small business subcontracting goals.</p>
<p>8. In the event a government facility is not completed prior to anticipated delivery, the government would like to know an estimated cost of storage per month of the finished assembly.</p>
<p>Attached are the draft specifications associated with this telescope and mount requirement.</p>
<p>Notice: Non-government personnel will be involved in this acquisition as technical advisors. The advisors are working for the following company: Valdez International Corporation, 1490 Garden of the Gods Road, Suite B, Colorado Springs, CO 80907. Valdez is under contract with the Academy to provide Research &amp; Development support.</p>
<p>All respondents are requested to indicate business size status in relation to the applicable NAICS code 333314 (Size Standard 500 employees). Also identify and address if your firm is 8(a), women owned, HUBZone, or otherwise classified as a small disadvantaged business. All interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines capabilities in providing all of the above mentioned requirements with respect to the provided specifications. The capabilities packages should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated. The response should not exceed 25 pages, single-spaced, 10 point typed. Please submit one hard copy on or before 30 May 2008 to Mr. Jan K. Christensen, 10 MSG/LGCW, 8110 Industrial Dr, US Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs CO 80840, and one electronic copy via email to the follwing address: jan.christensen@usafa.af.mil.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND

The Department of State (DOS) is seeking sources sought for the following requirement below. The contractor must provide to DOS a Capability Statement showing that they can meet the requirements of the DOS for the remote monitoring capability described below and is dependent upon the incorporation of 3D building and facility models into the SMSe.

The Security Management System enterprise (SMSe) was developed to achieve worldwide integration of selected technical security systems, with data availability to Diplomatic Security (DS) staff at post and to remote DS monitoring centers, for the purpose of better protecting people, information, facilities and operations.  Worldwide deployment was approved in 2004 and coincided with a shift in the focus of the technical security upgrade program to lock and leave posts.  

An essential component of the SMSe program has been a centralized security monitoring capability.  DS/ST is installing SMSe’s at overseas Foreign Service and certain domestic facilities to connect technical security and technical countermeasures systems at these facilities to monitoring and analysis centers in Washington and elsewhere.  This network-centric system greatly enhances the security of DOS facilities and provides DS Management with a truly global security perspective.  The data provided by this system provides managers with real time situational awareness during crisis situations that include terrorism events, fire, natural disasters, as well as identifying potential technical penetrations, failures of security infrastructure, and the operational status of counter-terrorism and technical security systems.  It provides the means for DS to remotely monitor the real time status, performance and integrity of systems directly related to life safety, counter-terrorism and technical surveillance.  It also produces an archive of security data that will greatly benefit security and counter-intelligence investigations, and through intelligent data mining, trend and pattern analysis, help identify potential threats.  Future SMSe functionality could include power assisted vehicle barriers, perimeter security systems, surveillance video, explosive detection, X-ray inspection, access control, intruder alarms, imminent danger notification, RF monitoring, fire detection, building systems control and monitoring.  The Contractor shall serve as a source of supply for 3D building and facility models.

INFORMATION REQUESTED
1.	What advantages would you suggest NAVFAC take under advisement when considering an enterprise application which is fully hosted by NAVFAC?2.	Please provide your input on an overall system design, including system software/hardware characteristics e.g. application software, Web application server, database server, reports server, etc. (and possible RFP requirements that NAVFAC should consider) which would meet the general intent described in the Background section described above.3.	Please provide your input on the commercial availability of all functionality listed under Functionality Desired section above.  Which of these items are difficult to achieve?4.	Please provide your input on the difficulty of meeting the requirements outlined in the DOD IT Requirements section above.5.	Please describe the strategy that you suggest NAVFAC should adopt (and RFP requirements NAVFAC should consider) for meeting the requirements listed under the Concerns section above.

CONCERNS
NAVFAC is requesting that respondents consider the following critical aspects of the system when addressing this request for information.
Implementation and Sustainability Methodology  The current system in use is a complex system composed of several subsystems that were developed and implemented independently over a timeframe of several years at least twenty years ago. These subsystems are based on out-of-date technology which has made it difficult and expensive to sustain due to their age resulting in serious functional limitations. Subsequent attempts to implement a replacement system have been plagued with planning and configuration difficulties. To ensure that the implementation and sustainability of a replacement system has the best chance for success, potential replacement systems nominated by respondents should have a proven methodology that they have consistently employed in the past and that is currently in use for implementing and sustaining their product. This methodology should describe in detail the various repeatable concepts and processes in use for, at the minimum, the following areas: 1) planning and configuration; 2) testing, training, and system go-live; 3) follow-on system operation and maintenance; and 4) sustainability support.
Software Releases and Customization  NAVFACs hosting facility located in Port Hueneme, California operates in an accredited Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) extended DeMilitarized Zone (eDMZ). As such, strict process, standards, procedures, and configuration and change management must be followed for all software/hardware changes. If customization is required in order to satisfy the requirements, software releases can become more difficult and costly to manage. Respondents are requested to provide their life-cycle recommendation on how best to manage both regular product upgrades and if required how best to manage them in conjunction with customization.   
Risk Management Methodology  In previous attempts to implement a replacement system, risks were difficult to properly identify and manage. As a result, the employment of a well-defined and repeatable methodology for effectively managing risk is critical during the implementation of a replacement system. Respondents nominating a replacement system should have a proven methodology that they have consistently employed in the past and that is currently in use for effectively managing risks. This methodology should describe in detail the various repeatable concepts and processes in use for, at the minimum, the following areas: 1) risk identification; 2) nature of the risk; 3) risk mitigation; and 4) risk scoring.
System Operational Usage Environments  In addition to the normal office environment where a system is used on a day-to-day basis, current business operations include both enclosed climate and non-climate controlled warehouses and open-air environments. The horizontal and vertical physical layouts of the warehouses necessitate a system to be capable of operating on a mobile computing device which would allow for either a store-and-forward communication method or the use of current mobile communications technologies. Due to the possible adverse environmental conditions that could be encountered during system usage in a warehouse, any mobile computing device used must have the capability to be safely operated by an end user without any potential negative physical effects. These capabilities would also enable the system to be used in either open-air local or remote-deployed work situations where it could be exposed to both hazardous environmental and intermittent communication conditions.
SUMMARY
This request is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the requested information. The Government will not provide a debriefing on the results of this request nor will respondents be contacted regarding information gathered. No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result of this request for information notice or Government use of any information provided.
Please email your responses to this RFI including Attachments (1) & (2) to the following NAVFAC points of contact by 23 May 2008: Maggie Evangelista, SCAN Contract Specialist, email: magdelena.evangelist@navy.mil and Lisa Howard, NXR4L Project Manager, email: lisa.howard1@navy.mil.
Please schedule your presentation & system demonstration with Ms. Howard or Mr. Steve Hammett by 9 May 2008 by calling (805) 982-2082.
Include your Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Phone Number, and EMAIL address on your response. In addition to completing both Attachments (1) & (2), please limit your response to 10 pages.

<DESC>Solicitation  W91ZLK-08-T-0377  Shock Test System<BR><BR>Questions :<BR><BR>1. CLIN0001 states that the machine must have a 200-lbs test capacity, yet the Specimen Characteristics state the payload at 2000 lbs. What is the payload expectation of the system ?  <BR><BR>I believe CLIN 001 must be a typo.  My requirement was always 2000 lb and what I supplied to the preparer as a spec.<BR><BR>2. There is no requirement stated for Instrumentation to monitor peak g, time duration, wave shape or provide tolerance conformance IAW MIL-STD-810F, Method 516.5, Procedures I and IV. Will the Government be providing Instrumentation or do they expect that instrumentation will be part of the offer ? <BR><BR> I expect a PC based controller will come with the system that will control/monitor the shock with contractor supplied software to conform with the MIL-STD tolerances.  At most the government will supply an accelerometer that may interface with the controller.  In the spec I supplied that was referred to as PC based system controller.<BR><BR>3. The Government clearly states that the following sawtooth pulses shall be provided: 20g, 11 ms; 40g, 11 ms and 75g, 6ms. Although the machine is capable of producing half-sine and square waveform pulses, there is no requirement stated that these pulses need to be supplied with the system. Is this true ? If not, what are the half-sine and square requirements ?<BR><BR>False, though square waveforms are not a requirement.<BR><BR>3A. The Govt has required QTY 4, half-sine Kits to provide capability of producing a range of long duration, half-sine impacts. Can the Govt. more clearly define what is meant by long duration, half-since impacts ?<BR><BR>Elastomer half sine kits that provide the following range of pulses: 15 g, 11 ms; 20 g, 11 ms; 30 g, 11 ms and 60 g, 6 ms half sine pulses are required.<BR><BR>3B. The Govt. has required QTY 4 sets of Lead Molds. Are these in addition to the molds supplied to meet the following sawtooth pulses: 20g, 11ms; 40g, 11ms and 75g, 6ms ? If so, what other sawtooth pulses are required ?<BR><BR>No, the additional molds would be duplicates for the sawtooth pulses above.<BR><BR>3C. The Govt. has required QTY 4 Dual waveform programmers for half-sine and trapezoidal impacts. What are the required half-sine and trapezoidal pulses ?<BR><BR>See above for half sine, trapezoidal are not a requirement.<BR><BR>4. The Govt. has required that Installation o the entire system be provided without advising:<BR><BR>a.	Ceiling Height and maximum system height allowance with a 60 inch tall specimen attached.<BR>b.	Nature of the floor: i.e. reinforced concrete, thickness.<BR>c.	May the floor be excavated to allow for a 4 ft x 4 ft x 4 ft pit.<BR><BR><BR>There is 30 feet of headroom available in the intended building for this machine.  It is a reinforced concrete floor and may be mounted either on the concrete or on an approximately 8 x 8 foot steel plate embedded in the floor of the building.  There is a requirement for the supplied machine to have an impact absorbing base.  I do not expect that excavation will be required, and the government will not be responsible for the cost if it is.<BR><BR>5. Is there a requirement for trapezoidal programmers ?<BR><BR>No  trapezoidal programmers are not part of this requirement.<BR><BR>6. What kind of building this equipment will be going in ?<BR><BR>The building has a 15 foot by 10 foot area in which the machine will be located. It has a 6-inch concrete floor. Our preference will be that the floor will not be drilled to put this machine in.<BR>

<DESC>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Westar Aerospace and Defense Group, Huntsville, Alabama, for an increase to the ceiling on the current Westar Contract DASG60-04-C-0017 for Component Integrated Modeling Simulation and Test Analysis Environment (CIMSTA-E).  The proposed action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  This action is to support continuation of current efforts related to providing services for integration of legacy and newly developed models, tools, processes and simulations, providing software techniques and integration tools that will execute these complex multi-element research and development activities for pre test planning and post test analysis.  Phenomenology models, test article models, and range instrumentation models are integrated to research the feasibility of, and predict the probability of executing complex flight and ground test experiments which replicate the operational BMDS system. They will also be used to support test design, scenario development, target design, test objective development, and operational realism.  Award to any source other than Westar would result in unacceptable delays and substantial costs.  This action will be a modification to the existing cost plus fixed fee contract.  The ceiling increase will support the execution of work planned through March 2009.  The significant duplication of cost involved with a new contractor is considered to be well beyond any cost savings that might be achieved through competition.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, this action is directed toward Westar Aerospace and Defense Group.  This acquisition is not open to foreign firms.  All responses should be directed to Dianne Trimble at dianne.trimble@smdc.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the publication date of this synopsis.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiated with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent to negotiate a sole source modification to Contract DASG60-04-C-0017 is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All responsible sources may submit a response which will be considered.  This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation.  Telephone or facsimile inquiries and/or responses will not be accepted.

AFFARS 5352.242-9500, Contractor Access to Air Force Installations

(a) Security Requirements.  The Contractor shall adhere to the installation security requirements as provided for in AFI 31-601, Industrial Security Program Management, and the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Supplement to AFI 31-601. When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the Contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1, The Air Force Installation Security Program, and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, as applicable.

(b) The Contractor shall submit a letter to the Contracting Officer specifying the personnel authorized to sign a USAFA Form O-111 requesting a Contractor Identification Badge or vehicle pass. The Contractor shall submit a USAFA Form O-111 on each employee requiring access to an installation. [The Contracting Officer or Sponsoring Official will endorse the request and forward a copy to the issuing base pass and registration office or security forces for processing. The individual requiring the badge will hand-carry the original Form O-111 to the issuing base pass and registration office or Security Forces for processing.]  When reporting to the registration office to obtain a vehicle pass, the authorized Contractor individual(s) should also provide a valid driver's license, current vehicle registration, valid vehicle insurance certificate, and any documents required by local Security Forces procedures.

(c) In lieu of USAFA Form O-111, Application For Personnel And Vehicle Passes To Work Under Air Force Contract, or a temporary AF FM 75, Visitor Pass, the Contractor shall obtain Contractor Identification Badges and/or vehicle passes for all Contractor personnel who make frequent visits (i.e., more than 7 visits per calendar year) to perform work on the Air Force installation(s) cited in the contract. Contractor personnel are required to prominently display their Contractor Identification Badges in a visible location above their waist while visiting or performing work on the installation. The Contracting Office may restrict the Contractor’s employees from accessing the installation(s) until Contractor Identification Badges and vehicle passes are obtained.

(d) During performance of the contract, the Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to the work site. Credentials and vehicle passes shall be returned to the issuing office within 5 calendar days after the employee no longer requires access to the work site.

(e) Background Checks.  All employees of the Contractor shall comply with USAFA security requirements while on the installation.  Prior to Contractor personnel working on USAFA installation properties, the Contractor and all Contractor personnel shall agree to USAFA conducting a criminal background check. USAFA Security Forces shall conduct the criminal background check accessing the appropriate state crime information center and national crime information center database to include, but not limited to any state listed by the employee as current and past addresses.  
 
(f) Convictions.  Based on the results of the background check, any felony conviction in the past ten (10) years involving violence, weapons, explosives, physical assault, espionage, illegal drugs, theft or any violations of immigration and naturalization laws shall constitute indisputable grounds for the Contracting Officer, with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately require removal of the employee from the effort under this contract.  For convictions more than ten (10) years ago, the Contractor may recommend retaining the employee.  Any misdemeanor conviction in the past five (5) years involving the same offenses as stated above shall constitute indisputable grounds, with coordination from the 10th Air Base Wing Commander, to immediately remove the employee from effort under this contract.  Employees removed by the Contracting Officer may also be subject to barment from entering the USAFA.  The Contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. The Contracting Officer shall be immediately notified of all such cases, and the Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to restrict the employee’s use on this contract until the case is resolved.  This action does not relieve the Contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.

(g) Warrants.  If during the course of Contractor Identification Badge processing, any Contractor personnel are found to have an outstanding warrant, Security Forces may detain the contractor employee and may notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities. The 10th Air Base Wing Commander may issue a barment letter based upon the gravity of the offenses surrounding the warrant. However, the Contractor may appeal the barment through the 10th Security Forces Squadron Commander to the 10th Air Base Wing Commander who may rescind the barment and permit the contractor employee to work on the installation. The Contracting Officer shall be immediately notified by the prime contractor of all such cases, and the Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to restrict the employee’s use on this contract until the case is resolved.

(h) Prior to use of an employee on this contract, the Contractor shall validate that the employee is a United States citizen or holds a valid resident alien status. If the employee is not a United States citizen, the Contractor shall validate the individual’s proof of alien registration with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service. The Contractor will cooperate in the Security Forces’ processing of its employees for Contractor Identification Badges for access to the USAFA under this contract. 

(i) If this contract requires that any of the Contractor's personnel must submit to a National Agency Check (NAC) background check, the Government shall bear the expense of that background check.  In that event, the Contractor agrees to fully cooperate in the processing of the NAC background check.  Those employees shall also be subject to the background check required for issuing a Contractor Identification Badge, as described above.

(j) Removal of Contractor Employees.  The Government reserves the right to direct the removal of an employee for substantiated misconduct (has the potential to jeopardize the mission, put themselves or others at risk, etc.) or security reasons.  This action does not relieve the Contractor from complete and satisfactory performance of the contract tasks specified herein.

(k) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the Contractor Access Identification, the prime Contractor shall ensure that all Contractor Identification Badges and vehicle passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office within 21 calendar days.

(l) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of payment.

(m) All references to Contractor above include the Contractor and Subcontractors.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-24.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Automated Gamma Spectroscopy Sample Changer System. ***

Background:   NIST’s Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory has a requirement for an automated sample changer system for high-resolution germanium gamma-ray spectrometry.  

***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:

 Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Automated Gamma Spectroscopy Sample Changer System, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:

General:  
An automated sample changer system with a capacity of typically 50 samples (but not less than 40) is required to transport samples from a storage area into a detector position within a lead shield and, after a preset counting time, back to the storage.  The changer shall have no lower counting time limit and the upper limit shall allow counting times of up to 50 hours or have no pre-set limitations. The samples will be in form of standard 20 mL scintillation vials, which are generally 25 mm in diameter and 60 mm high.

System Size:
The sample changer shall not significantly exceed the footprint needed for a vertical dipstick Germanium detector with full 10 cm wall thickness lead shield (2 feet x 2 feet) and the adjacent sample storage area within a 5 cm thick lead shield; i.e., no more than 3 feet x 6 feet footprint space shall be taken up by the system.

Sample Container and Storage:
It is planned to use standard 20 ml plastic or glass liquid scintillation (LSC) vials with nominal dimensions of 25 mm diameter and 60 mm height.  Slight differences among the various manufacturer styles of LSC vials must be tolerated.  The sample storage area shall be shielded at the base and against the room in all directions, except for the top, with 5 cm thick lead.  The walls of this shield shall be approximately 300 mm high.  If mechanically feasible, the vials shall be stored in a tray with at least 20 mm of the vial inserted into appropriate holes sunken into the 5 cm thick lead base.

Germanium Detector Shield:
The system shall contain a “4 pi” lead shield with an automatic opening/closing top.  The lead shield shall be fabricated from low-activity lead (lead bricks or cast segments) at least 10 cm (4 inches) thick and lined with a graduated absorber (e.g. Sn/Cu).  The minimum internal clearance shall be 150 mm.  The shield shall accommodate “in-line” vertical dipstick cryostats with the supports allowing for exchange of the typical 30 L detector dewars from below the shield.  The height of the shield shall allow for sample positions between 0 cm and 30 cm above the detector end cap with the lid closed, i.e. at least 50 cm internal height is necessary to provide this flexibility.  There shall be an exchangeable feed-through lead element on the bottom of the shield to allow for different detector end cap diameters.  An electrical drive mechanism shall be provided for the lid.  An operator shall be able to independently move the lid (or easily uncouple the drive for manual opening and closing the lid), e.g., when the system lacks AC power or otherwise encounters failure in automatically controlled mode.

Sample Transfer:
The sample changer control unit shall engage a pickup tool, which shall lift the sample vertically out of a pre-determined storage tray position, move the sample to the detector shield, and lower it (with the lid open) into the detector cavity.  The sample shall be set down in a fixed sample position in a sample holding device.  The tool shall release the sample and move out of the cavity, and the lid closes.  The tool shall wait atop the lid (or another default position) until the count is finished.  After opening of the lid, the tool shall be lowered to pick up the sample and move it out of the cavity back to its original storage location.  The tool shall be self-centering to securely pick up the sample.  The tool shall recognize failure (e.g., no sample in position) and generate an appropriate failure status in the control unit.  The tool shall automatically sense the vertical distance of the sample position above the detector (or it may be controlled by the sample changer control unit).  The tool shall feature a positive close and grasp design, so that in the event of an unexpected power loss the sample will not be dropped.

Sample Changer Control Unit:
A programmable CPU (e.g., commercial PC) shall control the sample changer and locally display its status and other operational parameters (color LCD display).  Typically, the control unit shall be a slave to the gamma spectroscopy analyzer.  The control unit shall interact with the analyzer via TTL-Level (+ or -) signals over BNC connectors, i.e., “Start Count” from control unit to analyzer when sample change cycle is completed, and “Change Sample” from analyzer to control unit when count is completed.  Local controls, presets, i.e., number of samples in storage, the sample/detector distance, and manual operation modes are user-entered at the control unit.  The unit shall control the sequence of pickup positions, the movements of the pickup tool, and the opening and closure of the detector shield.  An alternate operation mode with the lid open allowing counting in different geometries by holding the sample in position with the pickup tool for the duration of the count, up to 50 cm distance from the detector, is desirable.

Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. 

Award shall be made to the quoter whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical capability, past performance & price will be considered. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Minimum Specifications," 2) Past Performance, 3) Past Experience, and 4) Price.  

Technical capability, past performance, and past experience, when combined, shall be approximately equal importance to price. If Technical Capability and Past Performance are equivalent, price shall be the determining factor. 

Technical Capability:

Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quoters shall include the manufacturer or brand name, make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which addresses all salient characteristics, and clearly documents that the offered product meets salient characteristics stated above.

Only one responsible source and no other supplier or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C.  253 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1).  The cited authority is applicable because Gaven Industries is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.
Gaven Industries custom-builds Farday cages using heavier-gauge copper sheets which are soldered together to form a continuous ground plane.  This all-soldered design gives much better isolation from interfering radio signals than does the bolted design since no gaps, however small, are left between adjacent panels in the finished cage.  The exceptionally high shielding efficiency of Gaven cages has been demonstrated in a variety of laboratories, including the fMRI facility at the Johns Hopkins Kennedy Krieger Institute, where Gaven shielding has enabled researchers to perform the most demanding fMRI studies with high signal stability.  In addition to high shielding efficiency, the Gaven all-soldered design is more durable than the bolted design since bolted panels ultimately loosen due to temperature changes, floor subsidence, vibration and other ambient effects, leading to decreased shielding performance.  Soldered panels are immune to these effects.   This has permitted Gaven to offer a lifetime warranty on Faraday cages; such a warranty is available from no other vendor.  A market search produced no other vendors.    The period of performance is 2 months.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.  Award will be made on an all or none basis to the lowest price technically acceptable.

INTRODUCTION.<br />1.1. The mission of the Air Force Medical Operations Agency (AFMOA) South is to support Department of Defense (DoD) health professionals in optimizing the health and wellness of their populations through appropriate, effective and efficient healthcare practices and service delivery. The United States Air Force (USAF) is committed to taking care of its own. Our Air Force (AF) members and their families deserve the best support possible. AF readiness targets combat stress reactions, deployment environment and deployment-related stressors. Tailored support of the base helping agencies targets deployment challenges and engages the services of base helping agencies. The AF community is represented by several agencies, one of which is the Office of the Surgeon General (SG), Community Behavioral Health Division (CBHD).<br />1.2. The USAF SG CBHD provides military readiness support through management of various programs engaged in individual, family and community health initiatives. These programs include Family Advocacy; Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment/Demand Reduction; Education and Development Intervention Services/ Special Needs; and Suicide Prevention. Their objective is to address intervention and prevention strategies for common modifiable behavioral risk factors.<br />1.3. The challenge is recognizing the stressful situations of military members, specifically behaviors and concerns related to deployment stress. Congress has provided funding through the Department of Defense to the USAF to make available tailored support for pre-deployment, deployment, post-deployment, integration and combat stress reactions. There is an ongoing and urgent need to provide early psychological intervention as part of the first response to the traumatic events of pre- and post- deployment.<br />2.0. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES.<br />2.1. Summary of Services Required. This contract will involve the implementation of Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) three-day clinical training workshops, Continental United States (CONUS) two-day and three-day entry level clinical training workshops and four-day master clinician training workshops for military mental health provider (MHP), which include psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, mental health nurses, and mental health technicians. The goal of these workshops is to train military MHP to provide prolonged exposure therapy (PET) and Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) in both deployed locations and in garrison for active duty military members with combat-related anxiety stress disorder (ASD) and PTSD. In addition, the programs will be evaluated to monitor training effectiveness (e.g., pre/post testing for knowledge), use of PE/CPT by clinicians (survey active duty clinicians who have been trained), and other outcome measures (e.g., providing consultation on use of the PCL-M). Authorization for delivering continuing education (CE) credits should be gained by the contractor and CE offered to all eligible workshop participants. The contractors will provide their own equipment for the presentations, including a laptop and projector for running slides, as well as audio support, wires and cables as needed to put on a workshop as described above. The contractors chosen for the delivery of these services will have had deployment training and experience in treating active duty service members returning from OIF/OEF. Contractors with experience treating exclusively retirees or those discharged from the military will not meet the requirements of this contract.<br />2.2. Workshop Materials will be updated and specifically tailored for the PET/CPT treatment of combat-related ASD and PTSD in United States (U. S.) military personnel in both deployed and garrison settings. This will include the creation and updates of workshop handouts, reprints of scientific publications, clinical assessment materials, psychological measures and a provider's treatment manual. The contractor will provide clinical training workshop and consultation materials during training to each attendee in hard copy and/or electronic media form.<br />2.3. CONUS PET/CPT Clinical Training Workshops: The contractor will conduct 8 PET three-day CONUS clinical training workshops and 1 PET four-day CONUS master clinical development workshop at the following locations and dates. The contractor will also conduct 3 CPT two-day CONUS clinical training workshops and 1CPT four-day CONUS master clinician development workshop. All costs associated with travel, food, lodging, creating and transporting the manual or handouts, and miscellaneous expenditures are to be borne by the contractor and are assumed to be covered in the agreed upon cost per workshop. The workshops will include a review of evidence-based interventions for ASD and PTSD with a specific emphasis on PET. Approximately twenty-five to fifty military providers will attend each workshop and attendees will receive workshop type training in the assessment and PET treatment of ASD and PTSD in CONUS and deployed locations. Clinical case examples, including audiotapes and video of treatment sessions of active-duty military patients with ASD and PTSD who were treated in Iraq, will be reviewed. Portions of the training will also target non-provider positions such as mental health technicians in order to give them some idea about what their role might be in the delivery of care in a deployed setting. Attendees will be provided copies of assessment tools and a treatment manual for PET treatment of combat-related ASD and PTSD. The Government reserves the right to readjust the workshop dates in accordance with military and ops tempo demands</p>

<p>APPENDIX C. HQ USAF/SGR ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST</p>
<p>ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST<br />Revised: 30 Aug 2007</p>
<p>The purpose of this clause is to accomplish the following three objectives: (1) to inform prospective Offerors that AF/SGR presumes that award of this contract or task order may give rise to real or apparent OCIs with respect to other requirements or contracts within AF/SGR or the AFMS; (2) to assist current contractors and prospective Offerors in developing their own business strategies regarding participation in AF/SGR or AFMS requirements and in identifying and, where possible, avoiding or mitigating against OCIs; and (3) to ensure that all current contractors and prospective Offerors are afforded the maximum practicable opportunity to compete for all AF/SGR and AFMS requirements consistent with the restrictions required under FAR Subpart 9.5, Government Accountability Office (GAO) or Court of Federal Claims (COFC) decisions, and sound business practices.</p>
<p>The Contractor and all of its agents (including officers, managers, employees, consultants, and subcontractors) will fully comply with the Special Terms and Conditions Organizational Conflict of interest (OCI) required for efforts in support of AF/SGR activities. Contractor will ensure that all confidential and sensitive information will be fully protected. Such information will include, but not be limited to, all source selection sensitive information, government plans or strategies, and all proprietary information of other companies during contract performance. The disclosure of information shall not constitute a grant of any species of right, title, interest, or property in or to said information.</p>
<p>The Contractor understands and appreciates the absolute need to prevent conflicting roles that could or may bias its support to the AF/SGR office and its AF-wide responsibilities. To ensure that any support provided by the Contractor, its personnel, or its agents, is free of any bias in judgment or objectivity and to preclude the Contractor, its personnel, or its agents, from any unfair competitive advantage in current or future acquisitions, the Contractor will implement the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Organizational Isolation<br />&bull; Company Wide Policy Implementation<br />&bull; Non-Disclosure Agreements</p>
<p>Contractor participation in a requirement or contract with AF/SGR programs may give rise to an unfair competitive advantage in other AF/SGR procurement actions because of access to advance acquisition planning, source selection sensitive or proprietary information. Furthermore, contractor participation in one area may give rise to a real or apparent loss of contractor impartiality and objectivity where its advisory or planning assistance in one area potentially affects its present or future participation in another area.</p>
<p>For purposes of identifying, avoiding and/or mitigating against OCIs, AF/SGR will examine all its requirements and acquisitions for potential OCI or ethical problems, regardless of the cognizant contracting activity (e.g., AFDW, VA, GSA, other agency Multiple Award Schedules, etc.) or the type of contract vehicle used (e.g., FSS order, Multiple Award ID/IQ Contracts, BPAs, FAR Part 15 competitively awards, etc.).<br />An Offeror/Contractor wishing to submit an offer for this procurement, or any Offeror/Contractor which provides or previously has provided support to AF/SGR, must include the following as pan of its offer:</p>
<p>&bull; Perform a comparative analysis of the potential new work against all current and previous work performed in support of AF/SGR. The comparative analysis must be included in the proposal for the new work, and must include a statement certifying whether the contractor believes that its performance of the proposed new work would create a real or apparent OCI. If the contractor believes that no real or perceived OCI will result from an award of the proposed work, no additional action by the contractor is required.</p>
<p>&bull; If the Offeror/Contractor believes that a real or apparent OCI may exist as a result of an award, the contractor shall also submit an OCI Avoidance or Mitigation Plan with its proposal.</p>
<p>Inclusion of the comparative analysis and OCI Avoidance or Mitigation Plan will not be counted against any offer page limitations otherwise stated in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer (and when applicable the appropriate program office, acquisition manager, and legal counsel) will review the comparative analysis and, if provided, the Avoidance or Mitigation Plan, in accordance with the requirements of FAR Subpart 9.5 (Organizational Conflict of Interest) to make an independent determination of whether award to that Offeror would be consistent with those requirements. If it is unilaterally determined by the Contracting Officer that no OCI would arise or that the OCI Avoidance or Mitigation Plan adequately protects the interests of the government in the event of award to that Offeror, the Offeror will be determined, for purposes of this clause, to be eligible for award.</p>
<p>If the Offeror/Contractor knows of no OCI in accepting work under this contract, it shall certify its OCI status and submit the certification at the end of this clause with its proposal and any later award, if awarded the contract. The Contractor shall also obtain a similar certification of OCI status from all subcontractors, teaming partners or consultants prior to tasking any such party under this contract. The Contractor shall appropriately modify and include this clause, including this paragraph, in all consulting agreements and subcontracts of any tier to preserve the rights of the Government.</p>
<p>For breach of any of the above restrictions or for nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any relevant facts required to be disclosed concerning this contract, the Government may terminate this contract, disqualify the Contractor from subsequent related contractual efforts, and pursue any remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>Prior to a contract modification involving a change to the Performance Work Statement, or an increase in the level of effort or extension of the term of the contract, the Contractor shall submit any applicable organizational conflict of interest disclosure or an update of the previously submitted disclosure or representation.</p>
<p>The Offeror/Contractor should review the considerations below in determining whether or not a conflict of interest exists.</p>
<p>&bull; Does the Offeror or any intended subcontractors, teaming partners, proposed employees, or affiliates have Unequal Access to Information? Would award to the Offeror result in the Offeror having the opportunity to access nonpublic information that may give the Offeror a competitive advantage in a later competition for a government contract? Specifically, will the Offeror/Contractor have access to any of the following information:<br />o Budget(s), or Budget Information?<br />o Acquisition Sensitive Information related to the procurement process to include, but not limited to Acquisition Plans, Requirements, Statements of Work, or Evaluation Criteria?<br />&bull; Does the Offeror or any intended subcontractors, teaming partners, proposed employees, or affiliates have "impaired objectivity" because the Offeror's ability to render impartial judgments may be compromised because of its conflicting role(s) on this effort and other government contracts?<br />&bull; Do "biased ground rules" exist? Most commonly, this would include a situation where the Offeror has, as a government contractor, written specifications or a statement of work for this effort, which could skew competition in favor of itself?<br />&bull; Is the Offeror aware of any other information relating to this proposed contract/order, which could reasonably be construed as creating an OCI?</p>
<p>The Offeror/Contractor hereby certifies to the best of its knowledge its OCI status below:</p>
<p>(Offeror: Choose one of the following two statements. Delete the statement that does not apply.)</p>
<p>No real or perceived OCI, as defined in FAR 2.1 and discussed in FAR 9.5, will result from an award of the proposed work (there are no &lsquo;Yes' responses to the questions above).</p>
<p>A real or apparent OCI may exist as a result of an award and therefore an appropriate OCI Avoidance or Mitigation Plan is attached (Offeror shall include an appropriate OCI Avoidance or Mitigation Plan, as required by this clause, with its proposal to the Contracting Officer. [NOTE: Either delete statement #2, or delete the last phrase allowing them to submit it, or include following statement re Mitigation Plan f related to the AFDW BAA: Mitigation Plans are not permitted in order to resolve OCI issues involving contracts awarded under the AFDW A&amp;AS contract and the AFDW BAA.).</p>

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.

(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some internal forums.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>SYNOPSIS - 

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is soliciting proposals to establish a research and translation decision science and communication center that will facilitate access to evidence-based clinical and health care delivery information, and foster informed health care decisions by patients, providers, and policy makers.  The Center will work with AHRQ and its contractors to implement Section 1013 of the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. 

Under the contract, tasks will address a variety of assignments, such as developing health care information products based on comparative effectiveness reviews (CERs) related to clinical and behavioral topics, drugs, procedures, biologics and medical devices.  Information products will be developed for a minimum of 3 audiences:  patients, providers and policy makers.  Development of the information products will be based on an assessment that the Center will conduct on the target audiences and will factor in health literacy and numeracy issues, and other factors.  All information products will be pre-tested.  Additional tasks include: maintain and keep current a health care interpretation guide which converts scientific terms and phrases used in medical research literature and health care discussions into plain language that is understandable to the general public; facilitate broad dissemination and use of all developed products and provide technical assistance to users;  plan and hold two health care decision symposiums per year using venues appropriate for the targeted audiences; development of a biannual electronic newsletter; development of interactive decision aids based on CERs.

<CONTACT>Wali Achakzai, Acquisition & Assistance Specialist, Phone 202-216-6288, 4638, Email wachakzai@usaid.gov - Charles E. Mosby, Contracting Officer, Phone 202 216 6288 ex4189, Email cmosby@usaid.gov
<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), intends to issue a solicitation for proposals for design/build services to rehabilitate the Darunta Dam Hydroelectric Power Plant in Afghanistan. The power plant was constructed by Soviet Union (USSR) companies in the early 1960 and contains three vertical Kaplan (6 blade propeller) units with rated output of 3.85 MW each. The total electric power capacity is 11.5 MW. The plant is currently in very poor condition and requires major rehabilitation including possible replacement of all three turbines. The order of magnitude for the work anticipated by this solicitation is between US$ 5,000,000 and US$ 10,000,000.

USAID intends to issue this solicitation with a performance based Statement of Objectives (SOO) rather than detailed specifications. USAID will advise proposers of project objectives and desired outcomes but will not specify exact equipment requirements or rehabilitation methods. Proposers will have the opportunity to propose innovative, cost effective solutions for the rehabilitation of the power plant. This solicitation will be accomplished using full and open competition and all interested parties are invited to propose.  USAID intends to provide the maximum flexibility to each offeror to propose an innovative approach. USAID will issue a Request for Proposals (RFP). It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued in the first week of May 2008. 

USAID is considering conducting a per-solicitation meeting in Darunta Power Plant Site, Jalalabad-Afghanistan and requests statements of interest from prospective offerors that would like to participate in such a meeting. The pre-solicitation meeting is scheduled for 12-May-2008. During the pre-solicitation meeting, the followings will be accomplished:

•   An overview presentation of the project will be given and an opportunity to discuss the project will be extended to prospective offerors.
•   USAID will provide a presentation on Performance Based Contracting and the purpose of a Statement of Objectives (SOO).
•   Potential offerors will be provided guidance on the procedures for offering proposals on USAID contracts.
•   Potential offerors will be provided with a draft RFP for review and comment (the draft RFP would be simultaneously posted at FedBizOpps). 
•   USAID would receive questions, comments and suggestions from potential offerors and use this information in the development of the final RFP.

The pre-solicitation meeting would be conducted in both local and English languages and would probably last four hours. Potential offerors who have an interest in attending such a meeting should immediately advise USAID’s point-of-contact and provide the names of only two participants. If there is sufficient interest from potential offerors, pre-solicitation meeting arrangements will be made and participants will be provided meeting details as far in advance of the meeting as possible. 

USAID especially encourages Afghan and/or regional contractors to consider this business opportunity. 

For more information regarding this opportunity and to be kept apprised of solicitation release, please provide the following information to the USAID point of contact listed below:

•   Company name
•   Complete address of company
•   Point of contact at your company
•   Point of contact telephone
•   Point of contract email address

Award of the contract shall be made subject to the availability of funds. This letter in no way obligates USAID to award a contract nor does it commit the U.S. Government to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposals.
