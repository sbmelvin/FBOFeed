<DESC>The development of the SYMIN II system began in January 2010 by SAIC, and was completed in October 2011. However, there were significant issues with the application in which it did not meet FEDLINK's basic needs and required a follow on contract with SAIC to address these issues. These issues were resolved and on October 1, 2012 SYMIN II and SYMIN 1 were both running while reconciliation was performed between the two systems. In February and March, SYMIN II was updated with information for FY 2013, and they have been running in parallel from March until May 17, 2013 at which time SYMIN II became FEDLINK's production system for processing all of FEDLINK members' obligations, bills and payments.
<p>After the first couple weeks, two issues were identified as follows:</p>
<p>1. SYMIN II was receiving Momentum errors related to the uploading of Bills, Obligations, and Payments to Momentum.</p>
<p>As a result, FEDLINK has been delayed in making payments to vendors, and is unable to increase obligations, which threatens our ability to continue to make payments to vendors. Our inability to upload bills to Momentum, and send them to our members has put us in a position in which the members are requesting that we return the funds if we are not able to bill them, and will result in loss revenue to FEDLINK.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is&nbsp;have those issues corrected.<br /><br />SYMIN II is written in Java and runs on an Oracle 11g database</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Appistry Inc., 1141 South 7th Street, Suite 300, St. Louis, MO 63104 to procure the following:</p>
<p><strong><br />THIS IS A FOLLOW-ON REQUIREMENT</strong></p>
<p><strong>IT SECURITY PROVISIONS AND 508 COMPLIANCE LANGUAGE IS ALREADY OBTAINED FROM PREVIOUS CONTRACT.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procurement</span></strong>:<br /><br />1. Ayrris Large Appliance (software only) Annual contract;<br />2. Twelve months managed hosting of Ayrris on up to 512 Nodes;<br />3. UDP Pipeline Development and Integration of Pipeline with RURO LIMS 24/7 with Conversion to BioWolf.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. It was organized by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the NIH Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) and the NIH Clinical Center. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. A longstanding medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program. <br />identified new and rare diseases.</p>
<p>Genomic DNA will be isolated from all admitted Undiagnosed Diseases patients and family members. Depending on the phenotype of the patient, these DNA samples will be sent for exome sequencing as the first step to obtain variant information that may determine the mechanism of the patients' disease. The Undiagnosed Diseases Laboratory will perform extensive analyses on the large amount of exome sequencing and variant data that is generated in a timely manner to facilitate genetic studies when combined with SNP analysis. This information will then be used to perform research experiments to discern the genetic and molecular basis of 4 the unique disease of the patient.</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong><br /><br />Appistry Ayrris has been integrated with the RURO LIMS 24/7 system that allows for a continuous pipeline that makes collecting, storing, managing and routing data simple, reliable and efficient. This has enabled the NIH UDP laboratory to establish and maintain a full change of custody for samples and associated data across the experimental life cycle, standardize physical and digital processes to achieve compliance with specific regulations, and create production-grade workflows necessary for the laboratory. They have executed the NIH UDP Diploid-Alignment Pipeline on Ayrris and integrated this pipeline within LIMS 24/7 that allows users to monitor the progress of the pipelines without requiring detailed knowledge of how the pipeline is executing. Appistry has currently developed this pipeline in collaboration with the NIH UDP and will continue to perform these analyses with the UDP next-generation data that is generated by sequencing UDP patient exomes.</p>
<p><strong>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</strong>:</p>
<p>Twelve (12) months from the date of award.</p>
<p><strong>JUSTIFICATION</strong>:<br /><br />In a previous contract award, Appistry integrated Ayrris and LIMs24/7 to allow the laboratory to turn workflows into a continuous pipeline that has made collecting, storing, managing, and routing data simple, reliable, and efficient. Integrating the LIMS with a robust big-data environment has enabled the UDP laboratory to establish and maintain a full chain of custody for samples and associated data across the experimental life cycle, standardize physical and digital processes to achieve compliance with regulations such as CLIA, HIPAA or Safe Harbor, and create production-grade workflows necessary for running defined lab workflows at scale. Additionally, Appistry has executed the NIH UDP Diploid-Alignment Pipeline on Ayrris and integrated it with the Ruro LIMS 24/7. Appistry has successfully tested running the Diploid-Alignment Pipeline on Ayrris in Appistry's St. Louis datacenter with execution times taking approximately 26 hours on 100 CPU-cores. This pipeline consists of two phases with the first phase run per individual, and the second phase run per trio or cohort. The Broad Institute GATK Best Practices are followed where appropriate along with extensive parallel executions of time-intensive steps such as alignment, base quality score recalibration, and variant calling.</p>
<p>Appistry has also implemented the pipeline within LIMS24/7 by creating two subject workflows corresponding to the two phases of the pipeline. During their pipeline execution on Ayrris, the respective LIMS24/7 subjects are updated automatically through Ayrris-LIMS24/7 API calls to reflect their movement through the workflows. This enables a LIMS24/7 user to monitor the progress of the pipelines without requiring detailed knowledge of how the pipeline is executing.</p>
<p>The current contract will allow the use of Appistry Ayrris to align, genotype, and annotate next generation sequencing short reads from 600 individuals consented to the NIH UDP research protocol. They will be doing this using the NIH UDP Diploid-Alignment pipeline that has been developed in collaboration with the NIH UDP. <br /><br /><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY:</strong></p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) as set forth in FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541511, Custom Programming Services, small business size standard is $25.5M. . The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant Contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-72 (January 30, 2014).</p>

<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is a centralized research facility for performing high-throughput, large-scale DNA sequencing and sequence analysis. NISC has served the NIH community for over 17 years as a source for high-quality large-scale sequencing and analysis. As next generation sequencing applications expand, so does the demand for services, not only within NHGRI but throughout the NIH community. Maintenance and upkeep is a MUST to maintain productivity at NISC. Failure of equipment will cause a delay in process down the manufacturing production line. The parts are unique to these instruments and cannot be substituted by other vendor parts.<br /><br />In addition to providing investigators at the NIH access to large-scale DNA sequencing, NISC plays a major role in several efforts related to the Human Genome Project including a Comparative Vertebrate Sequencing Initiative, the ENCODE Project, and the Mammalian Gene Collection Program. NISC is also an active participant in the International Sequencing Consortium. While it is currently feasible to sequence an entire genome it is quite expensive and unwieldy. When an investigator wishes to study only selected genes or genomic regions it is more cost-effective and efficient to perform targeted sequencing. It is essential that all the Illumina systems are maintained under a service contract in order to prevent disruption of scientific research.</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVES:</strong></p>
<p>The MiSeq, HiSeq 2000, HiSeq 2500 and cBot systems are necessary components for NISC/NHGRI sequencing production process. Maintenance and upkeep is a MUST to maintain productivity at NISC.

<p><strong>Period of Performance</strong>:</p>
<p>March 2014 through October 2014</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. UDP was organized by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the NIH Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) and the NIH Clinical Center. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. A longstanding medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program. <br /><br />In a previous contract with the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP); the Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OSHU), Ontology Development Group headed by the Department of Medical Informatics and Epidemiology has developed a novel algorithm that is used to map similar phenotypes across species (OWLSim) and tools for recording human phenotypes in human phenotype ontology terms (Phenotips). These tools and algorithms have been incorporated into the UDP LIMS pipeline to systematically define and describe patient clinical phenotypes into universal terms.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong>:</span></p>
<p>The objective of the contract with Oregon Health &amp; Science University is to provide support for UDP clinical phenotype annotation entry and standardization to UDP data in LIMs. OSHU will add glycomics data into the phenotype comparison and annotation that is required by the Undiagnosed Diseases Program. Furthermore, OHSU will produce a mechanism to include negative annotations into the phenotype comparison and visualization tool. This is a continuation of the 2013 contract awarded to the Oregon Health &amp; Science University that has now been implemented in the UDP LIMS 24/7 system.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements for this acquisition are as follows</span>:</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor shall facilitate a phenotype annotation community within the pipeline of the UDP.<br />&bull; Contractor shall enable recording and annotation questions and requests to be viewed and searched by others.<br />&bull; Contractor shall set up a notification service to email the phenotype curation and ontology tem updated discussions.<br />&bull; Contractor shall curate UDP term requests into HPO terminology.<br />&bull; Contractor shall implement logical definitions to aid the interoperability with other ontologies and support semantic similarity.<br />&bull; Contractor shall provide user feedback and training for UDP term requests and phenotype data quality assurance.<br />&bull; Contractor shall provide software integration and enhancement.<br />&bull; Contractor shall implement the use of negation in the OWLsim2 algorithm for matching against human and model organism phenotypes.<br />&bull; Contractor shall enhance the model pathway display widgets to utilize the NOT annotations.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Government will be responsible for reviewing and approving reports and similar matters generated:</span></p>
<p>1. Results will be provided electronically to the UDP via secure email, the UDP ftp site or direct deposition into the UDP process management system.<br />2. Results will also be shared with UDP collaborators as defined mutually.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REGULATORY AUTHORITY:<br /></span></strong><br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source.</p>

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue a sole source acquisition pursued under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements." The Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to Insitu, Inc., Bingen, WA will be to extend existing UAS ISR services aboard a United States Navy (USN) ship. The contract will be a one year base contract with three six month options and will prevent a break in critical UAS ISR services in direct support of CENTCOM and 5th Fleet tasking. Insitu, Inc. is the only company who can fulfill this requirement because the time required for another company to convert the ship to a different UAS system would remove the ship and UAS ISR capability from service for a prolonged period of time and create an unacceptable break in service. The purpose of this acquisition is to provide for the continuation of existing UAS ISR services until a competitive contracting action is awarded and a replacement ship is outfitted with a UAS system, arrives in theater and begins conducting operations. <br />Unless otherwise stated herein, no formal request for proposal or additional written information is currently available. A determination by the Government not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government. This synopsis is published for information purposes only. (THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS). <br />Subcontracting opportunities should be sought directly from Insitu, Inc. IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR INTERESTED PARTIES: There are no commitments by the Government to issue any solicitations, make an award, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties before award of a contract for the efforts mentioned above.

<DESC>Note: This Solicitation and award is restricted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(4) International agreement to Danish and Greenlandic Firms ONLY. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue a solicitation package seeking to award a firm-fixed price contract for the construction of the removal and replacement of the center 170 foot keel portion, of approximately half (5,000 LF) of the existing asphalt runway pavement. Replacement of materials shall be through the upper 6 inches of base course of the existing runway. This is considered to be Phase 1 of a 10,000 LF runway. The project renovations include the replacement of the runway edge lighting, runway threshold bar, other associated electrical upgrades.  The other half of runway shall be kept operational during construction. The Contractor must adhere to height clearances on this active runway at all times. The construction season is short at Thule Air Base and the runway must be completed by the end of the 2015 summer/fall construction season so the full 10,000 foot runway can be used in the Winter & Spring seasons as food, supplies and personnel must be accessible to the Base.   It is anticipated that the successful contractor will spend the remainder of the 2014 construction season crushing and preparing the aggregate for use in the following construction season in 2015 .  <br>    <br> General Conditions at Thule Air Base: The location of Thule Air Base limits exterior work to the months of June through September, although work is sometimes possible in May or October. Additionally, Thule's location demands that all supplies & personnel must be shipped and/or transported, in or out, via air and/or sealift. Thule Air Base is not a commercial air/sea port and there is no other access. Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally. The region is glaciated and the existing soil is generally permafrost, which exists from 1 to 6 feet below the surface and to a measured depth of 1,600 feet. Average winter temperature is 20 -30 degrees F below zero while average summer temperature is 40-50 degrees F above zero. One annual military cargo sealift departs from Norfolk, Virginia to Thule AB, approximately 1 July. There are two sealifts that go from Copenhagen, Denmark to Thule AB, one in July & one in August. Airlifting any materials or equipment via military aircraft is very expensive and only on an emergency-need basis. The project magnitude is between $10,000,000 -$25,000,000. The performance period shall be approximately 540 calendar days from the issuance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP).  <br>  <br> Anticipate the plans and specifications to be posted electronically on or about 18 March 2014 via the Federal Business Opportunity Website at www.fbo.gov, with a bid opening on 22 April   2014.  The applicable NAICS Code is 237310 Commercial and Institutional Building Construction with a size standard of $33,500,000.00. The SIC Code is 1611. Make certain that the NAICS code of 237310 must be in the System for Award Management.  Any and all amendments shall be likewise posted. Hard copies will not be available. It is the contractor's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOps web-site for any amendments. Bidders are required to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov . Award will be made to the lowest responsible bidder.  <br>  <br> Bids will be opened simultaneously at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Copenhagen, Denmark as well as in the Corps of Engineers, New York District office. The exact location and room number will be included in the solicitation. All questions must be submitted in writing via email, fax, or mail to the POC. The media selected for issuance of Synopsis/Solicitation and amendments shall solely be at the discretion of the Government; accordingly, the media utilized for this project shall be the internet. Telephone, email or fax requests for the solicitation will not be accepted or honored. Paper copies of this solicitation and amendments, if any, will not be available or issued. Plans and specifications will NOT be provided in hard paper copy or CD-ROM format. The solicitation and all amendments for this acquisition will be posted on a secure Government website known as FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) once the solicitation is issued. Interested parties may download and print the solicitation at no charge from the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website, https://www.fbo.gov.  <br>  <br> All vendors who want access to the solicitation must be registered System for Award Management (SAM) located at www.sam.gov, and FedBizOpps.

<DESC>The installation (previously known as the Concord Naval Weapons Station) is now known as Military Ocean Terminal Concord (MOTCO), which the Department of the Army has taken possession from the Department of the Navy several years ago. The current areas that require Lightning Protection Systems were originally constructed (for the Department of Navy missions) without protection from lightning strikes.  <br>  <br> The current customer desires the installation of Lightning Protection Systems that are to cover the following 4 locations; Classification Yards 1 & 2, Building 177, and the  quote mark R quote mark  Buildings (#'s 1 through 4). These locations are separated from one another and are located on the Tidal Side of the Installation where there is the potential for uncovering Unexploded Ordnance (UXO). This situation will require special circumstances during the construction effort, which will include the employment of UXO Construction Support during all construction activities that break the existing ground surface on the installation.  <br>  <br> The basic approach to the construction of the MOTCO Lightning Protection project will be to erect steel poles with construction of overhead catenaries except at R1-R4 building site.  Here both steel and wood poles are utilized, with and without overhead catenaries and air terminals.

Subject:  Network Management System Support Services
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal, a Solicitation, a Request for Quote or, an indication that the Government will award a contract for the services contained in this RFI.  This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request.  The Government does not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with submission of the information being requested or, reimburse expenses incurred for responses to this RFI.  Companies are encouraged to respond if they have the capability and/or capacity to provide the equipment identified below.  Respondents should identify their company name, address, email, telephone number and a name and telephone number of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with government representatives.  
This RFI is for The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Information & Technology (OIT) and requires the vendor to provide Network Management support (NMS) Services for the Region 5 Local Area Network (LAN) infrastructure.  These efforts include advocacy and maintenance of standardized lifecycle processes for VA tasks and projects.  These NMS services help with expanding and maintaining a fully stable Veteran's Benefit Administration (VBA) network, which is supported by Region 5 of Office of Information Technology (OIT) Service, Delivery and Engineering (SDE). This service also allows Region 5 to properly mitigate CRISP mandated actions to secure and safe guard the VBA network; those tasks include but not limited to converting all communication into a secure shell style of communication. This NMS contract is also in charge of trouble shooting the VBA network when something is wrong and determining the best course of action to fix the situation that had arouse. The NMS personnel work in-depth with Region 5 personnel to identify any type of network issue that could arise or happen which could cause a lapse in VBA production work.  VBA consists of over 58 LANs and many more small LANs in out- base facilities.  VA Region 5 has been tasked with implementation and support of these LANs and does not have sufficient in-house resources to perform the requirement, nor does the VA as an entire entity have the sufficient in house resources to perform the requirement.  In order to meet these needs in a timely fashion while supporting the growth in user base, Region 5 continues to require support staff, both to provide coverage for expanded hours, expanded responsibility, and to support the increase in the volume of user help requests.  With the additional complexity and the added enterprise requirements, plus the additional install/testing requirements.
ease see the attached Performance Work Statement for additional information and details. 

Responses shall be limited to less than five (5) pages.  Responses should include, but not be limited to, respondent's capability info, suggested equipment lists, rough order of magnitude costs, and period of performance input.  Submissions are due NO LATER THAN 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), March 13, 2014 and may be made by e-mailing a response to: Joanne DeFazio at joanne.defazio@va.gov and Jan Oberdick at jan.oberdick@va.gov.

<DESC> <br> 1.  Sources Sought.    The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC)-Fort Eustis, VA is seeking competition for flight training services at Fort Rucker, AL.  We have identified several impediments to competition and we seek industry input on possible approaches to overcoming the barriers.  First, the requirement requires significant initial investment in infrastructure.  The contractor must provide all aircraft, flight simulators, and real property facilities (hangars and classroom facilities, plus supporting equipment and material necessary to conduct the training for C-12 Aviator Qualification Course (AQC), C-12 Instructor Pilot Course (IPC) and C-12 Aviator Refresher Course (simulator only) for the U.S. Army Fixed Wing Training Courses.  The U.S. Army HQ for Aviation resides at Fort Rucker, AL.  The current incumbent contractor already has existing facilities and simulators.  Until now, the training aircraft, the C12s, have been supplied by the Army; however, in the future, the contractor must supply all training aircraft.  Secondly, the location is remote.  Available airports do exist in the area; however, class D airspace is required.  Thirdly, the period of performance contemplated is a five to ten year period of performance.  Input on the period of performance that would be necessary in order for your firm to compete for the requirement is requested, even if it is outside of the contemplated period.  The Army requests information in regards to which firms would be interested in competing for these services and input on possible solutions or ways to overcome the barriers to competition that currently exists.  If there are no interested parties other than the incumbent, the Army will seek to procure the services through a sole source vehicle.  We request a business case package in which a convincing argument is made as to your willingness to compete for the requirement, your capability to provide the services, and the feasibility to the U.S. Army as to any recommendations that you make to enhance the competitive nature of this action. <br>  <br> The services to be performed shall include personnel with the appropriate certificates and qualifications to instruct flight students to include current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certificates as well as logged air time and personnel management with experience supervising fixed wing flight training.  The estimated annual student attendance consists of 180 students for the C-12 AQC, 64 students for the C-12 IPC and 216 students for the C-12 REF course.  The Government is looking for interested parties that are capable of providing training aid such as Stage I aircraft (single engine), Stage II aircraft (multi-engine) and Stage III aircraft (multi-engine turbine), as well as C-12V flight simulators, simulator training devices, the appropriate literature, schematics, drawing, charts, and facilities, etc., to conduct the fixed wing training.  All aircraft, maintenance facilities, etc. shall be provided by the contractor.

<DESC>NASA intends to issue an Asteroid Redirect Mission Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) on March 21, 2014.  NASA is developing concepts for the Asteroid Redirect Mission, which would use a robotic spacecraft to capture a small near-Earth asteroid, or remove a boulder from the surface of a larger asteroid, and redirect the asteroid mass into a stable orbit around the moon.  Astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft launched on the Space Launch System would rendezvous with the asteroid mass in lunar orbit, and collect samples for return to Earth.  <p> To support mission formulation and reduce risk and cost, this BAA solicits proposals for studies and related technology development activities in the following areas: <p> 	Asteroid capture system concepts using deployable   structures and autonomous robotic manipulators. 	Rendezvous sensors that can be used for a wide range of mission applications including automated rendezvous and docking, and asteroid characterization and proximity operations. 	Commercial spacecraft design, manufacture, integration, and testing capabilities that could be adapted for development of the Asteroid Redirect Vehicle (ARV) or its main components such as the Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) tug. 	Partnership opportunities for secondary payloads on either the ARV or the Space Launch System (SLS). 	Partnership opportunities for the Asteroid Redirect Crewed Mission or future missions in areas such as advancing science and in-situ resource utilization, enabling commercial activities, and enhancing U.S. exploration activities in cis-lunar space after the first crewed mission to an asteroid. <p> The duration of the studies is anticipated to be 180 days, with an interim report due in October.  NASA may use the data resulting from this effort to inform the Asteroid Redirect Mission Concept Review (MCR), which is planned for late 2014 or early 2015. <p> Proposals shall be submitted electronically in Adobe PDF format to: HQ-Asteroid-BAA@mail.nasa.gov. Specific evaluation criteria, eligible participants, and submission information for each solicitation topic will be identified in the BAA. Proposals will be due on May 5, 2014.	 <p> To assist the planning of the proposal evaluation process, NASA strongly encourages the submission of a Notice of Intent (NOI) to propose by all prospective offerors.	The NOI should contain the following information:  name, address, telephone number, email address, and institutional affiliation of the offeror.	NOIs are strongly encouraged, but are not required. Not submitting an NOI will not impact the selection process. NOIs shall be submitted to the email address given above by April 4, 2014. <p> An Asteroid Initiative Opportunities Forum will be held at NASA Headquarters on March 26, 2014, and proposers will have a chance to ask questions about this Announcement. The meeting agenda and registration information is posted on the BAA website at <A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov/asteroidinitiative">http://www.nasa.gov/asteroidinitiative </A>

It will also support training of scientists from Cambodia and scientists from the NIH sponsored Malaria Research and Training Center in Bamako, Mali. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.<br /><br /><strong>Background</strong>: In 2005, The Laboratory of Malaria and Vector Research (LMVR), Division of Intramural Research (DIR), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in partnership with the National Center for Malaria Control, Entomology and Parasitology (CNM) in Phnom Penh, Cambodia established a malaria research initiative. This program is currently being expanded to include new laboratory facilities at the University of Health Sciences (UHS) in Phnom Penh. These facilities will need to be set up and operational during FY13. Cambodia has been described as the "epicenter of anti-malarial drug resistance" in Southeast Asia and serves as a unique base to study mechanisms of parasite resistance as well as genetic resistance and acquired immunity to both P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria. LMVR is involved in research on all aspects of malaria and its vectors. This includes studies on pathology and immunology in the human host, studies on malaria prevention and control, studies on the genetics of the malaria parasite, studies on anti-malarial drug resistance, and studies on the mosquito vectors of malaria. This work is encompassed in three major projects based in Cambodia; three clinical studies and one entomological study.

<p>NAICS code: 541519</p>
<p>Notice Type: Sources Sought</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).The Social Security Administration (SSA), Office of Acquisition and Grants (OAG), in conjunction with its customer, the Office of Telecommunications and Systems Operations (OTSO), is seeking to identify responsible vendors capable of providing equipment/service for Employees with Disabilities (EWD). We are looking for sources capable of providing solutions relative to the Agency's strategy and requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose is to provide SSA with the technical expertise necessary to provide support services and assist with planning, procuring, configuring, installing and optimizing hardware, software, and procedures for Information Technology (IT) systems in support of operational activities. Support includes hardware installation and configuration, software installation; help desk support, and engineering support to configure assistive technology (AT) to SSA's environment, as well as, the implementation and maintenance of AT products.<br />SSA is seeking information in the form of documentation and from interested sources regarding the below requirements.</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor shall provide the SSA with procuring, handling, deploying, configuring, installing, supporting, and maintaining government-owned assistive hardware, software and peripheral devices to accommodate the needs of the Agency's EWD.</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor shall develop, test, and implement AT, operating system migration and releases of new or updated software, firmware, and/or devices and device drivers and JAWS and MAGic scripting</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor shall provide program management and administrative support.</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor shall provide Help Desk support services.</p>
<p>&bull; Contract shall provide a vehicle for the procurement, distribution and support of AT software, as needed by the Government.</p>
<p>&bull; Contract shall provide distribution, support, installation, de-installation, and relocation of AT hardware, as needed by the Government.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>The EWD initiative is essential for providing the support needed to ensure the Agency is compliant with all federal regulations, and accommodations are made for our approximately 1,600 disabled employees. SSA provides assistive software, hardware, and peripherals including keyboards, mice and other devices, as well as, specialized support services to accommodate the needs of the agency's EWD. SSA is committed to recruiting, training, and retaining EWD. Employing EWD requires SSA to ensure that all of its electronic and information technologies are accessible to people with disabilities. <br />SSA currently has 2,000 sites nationwide including Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico with approximately 2,300 Local Area Networks (LAN) installed nationwide. SSA currently uses an Ethernet routed worldwide network to Windows-based computers.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>We are attaching a draft Statement of Work to this notification that better explains our requirements. Please note that this Statement of Work may reference documents, attachments, and sections that we have not included. Furthermore, the Statement of Work and any document attached to this RFI are not final and may be subject to change.</p>
<p>We request information from businesses that believe they have a bona-fide capability to meet the Agency's EWD requirements. Specifically, interested firms should submit the following information:</p>
<p>1) <strong>General Information:</strong> Include the company name, address, point of contact name, point of contact number, DUNS Number, business size status for the indicated NAICS code.</p>
<p>2)<strong> Capabilities:</strong> In two pages or less, provide an explanation for how your firm has the capability and experience to support the Agency's EWD requirement. Include details of how you provided similar services to Federal Government clients previously (include contract number, date of award, dollar value, and explanation of how support relates to the potential requirements stipulated within this notice).</p>
<p>3) <strong>Documentation Comments:</strong> Provide any comments or suggestions to the current Statement of Work and related documentation. Identify any areas that appear ambiguous or otherwise unclear.</p>
<p>4) <strong>Availability of Services through Existing Contracts:</strong> We presently believe that the scope of this acquisition; the number and variation in the types of equipment and services required; and the unique terms and conditions (such as our need to establish a Contract/Delivery Order over a seven-year period) can be provided by an existing Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) or General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS). As a matter of fact, we believe that there are multiple GSA 8(a) STARS II contractors that may be a good fit for this potential requirement and that could meet the requirements specified in the RFI. Therefore, if you can meet the specifications of this requirement using a GWAC or GSA FSS, please indicate so when responding. However, if you believe otherwise, please provide specific details that could assist the Agency in determining the best source of supply to procure our requirement, and why the Contractor feels the agency could get the highest quality of supplies and services at the lowest price using another vehicle.</p>
<p>5)<strong> Help Desk Support:</strong> The AT Help Desk is currently available from 6am to 7pm EST. SSA is considering the possibility of changing the help desk availability hours from 6am to 6pm local prevailing time, for any site in the country. Therefore, Baltimore, MD would have help desk support from 6am to 6pm and Hawaii's Help Desk support would also be available from 6am to 6pm. In your response, please explain how the different times in the different time zones would affect the cost. <br />Also, feel free to make any suggestions that might be in the government's best interest.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought for Tutoring Services
The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Benefits Administration, is soliciting a service requirement to establish an Open Market Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for Tutoring Services to Eligible Chapter 31 Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment disabled Veterans under the Department of Veterans Affairs Vocational Rehabilitation Program (Chapter 31). The BPA duration will be for five (5) years and the Contracting Officer will ensure that each BPA is reviewed at least annually. The anticipated effective date is: 2-3-2014 through 2-2-2019.

The Government will accept bids from all bidders that qualify under NACIS code 611691. The size standard is $7.0 million.

The Contractor shall provide all inclusive tutoring services which cover transportation, lodging, books, supplies, equipment, or any other expenses associated with the provision of the tutoring services. The Contractor will be required to provide tutoring at the college level in a wide variety of subjects including, but not limited to low to high levels of Mathematics, English, Writing courses, Statistics, Economics courses, Biological Sciences, Anatomy, Physiology courses, Chemistry and Physics courses,  miscellaneous Business courses, all College Level Math Courses, Accounting Courses, Discrete Mathematics, College Level Prep Math, College Level Prep Algebra, Intermediate Algebra, College Algebra, Trigonometry, Business Calculus, Pre-Calculus, Calculus I, Calculus II, Calculus III, Statistics, and Differential Equations, Trigonometry, College Level English, Composition and Research Assistance, College Prep Writing, College Prep Reading, English Composition I, English Composition II, Basic Math, any Education Courses, ABE Courses, & any Microsoft Courses, Botany, Biology, Microbiology, Zoology, Anatomy, Physiology, Physics classes, Language Arts Classes C++, Java, Oracle/SQL, Visual Basic, HTML, Instructional Technology.

The resultant Request for Proposals, as well as any subsequent award, is subject to the applicable terms and conditions set forth under Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13. Pricing for services will not exceed the ceiling prices negotiated.  

MULTIPLE AWARDS: Since experience has demonstrated that one contractor cannot provide a guarantee to meet our needs, it is our intention to make multiple awards with a possible restriction on the number of awards made. In some instances, it is possible that a contractor's tutoring services may not be utilized at all. The VA will order tutoring services, on an as-needed basis. Orders will be rotated between qualified tutors in the area where the Veteran resides. Performance and availability will be critical factors in obtaining orders. The VA shall award new BPA Holders during the duration of the five (5) year agreement if a need exists. The Government anticipates to award on or about 2/3/2014.
Please send your sources sought responses no later than January 22, 2014 via email to alanna.crawford1@va.gov. No formal solicitation document exists at this time. Responses to this notice should include the following: name and address of company/provider; business size; socio-economic category, if any; if services are on a Federal Supply Schedule; firm's experience in providing tutoring services which demonstrates firm's ability to meet the above requirement, in strict accordance with applicable rules and regulations.

System for Award Management (SAM): In August 2012, the General Services Administration (GSA) moved ORCA and CCR into SAM (https://www.sam.gov/sam/). If you were registered in CCR, your company's information is already in SAM. You just need to set up a SAM account. For additional Information Contact 1-866-606-8220 (US Calls), International Calls: 334-206-7828. By submitting an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement to be registered in the SAM database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from the solicitation.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Bioquant Image Analysis Corporation located in Nashville, TN, to purchase an upgrade to our existing imaging system along with two satellite stations allowing for measurements to be conducted without interrupting image capture procedures.  This upgrade also includes upgrading the existing camera to a 1000 megapixel resolution for live scanning and live digital imaging and an upgraded 0.1 micron resolution manual encoded XY stage will also be fitted to the existing microscope. The high level of accuracy of this system has provided very accurate and suitable image measurements for multiple researchers and changing the systems may impair research.  So this creates the need to negotiate a sole source award for the procurement action described above.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under FAR Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation and Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.302-1). This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 511210 with a size standard of $35.5 million average annual receipts. <br /><br />AFRL&nbsp;requires the purchase of a software toolset to bridge their communications with current data-link software technology. The proposed contract type is Firm Fixed Price for a perpetual enterprise software license agreement allowing an unlimited number of copies/installations to AFRL. The software package needs to bridge incompatible operational waveforms LINK-16 and Situational Awareness Data Link [SADL] and provide interoperability between different data formats to include LINK-16 J-Messages, Cursor on Target [COT], Keyhole Markup Language [KML], Key Length Value [KLV] while providing user friendly operation to tactical users. <br /><br />Required Capabilities:<br /><br />&bull; Host Platform J Link-16 radios <br />&bull; Host SADL radios <br />&bull; Enable J-Message text chat<br />&bull; Provide interoperability and forwarding between datalinks<br />&bull; Contain an easily transferrable SA Mode database <br />&bull; Utilize an intuitive user interface<br />&bull; Perform JREAPC client functions<br />&bull; Provide the ability to connect directly to SA Mode radios<br />&bull; Provide the ability to organize received data<br /><br />The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract to for a perpetual enterprise license agreement for TRAX 1.0 software. The&nbsp;software producer is:<br /><br />Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC)<br />18635 Jarkey Drive<br />Hagerstown, ND 21742
<p><br />The government has determined no other company's software offers an all-in-one communications bridging solution, operable by the tactical user. Alternatives do not offer the intuitiveness of TRAX, and are not easily configured in the field; alternatives require in-depth knowledge of actual waveforms for configuration, which may be beyond the training of the end user, who simply requires communications interoperability. <br /><br />This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to Bryant.Soule@us.af.mil Responses to this notice must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements. <br /><br />Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 1 April 2014.&nbsp; <br /><br />A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award.</p>

<p>US Peace Corps<br />President Kennedy formed the Peace Corps with an executive order on March 1, 1961 and in 1979, it was made a fully independent federal agency.  Since its founding, more than 200,000 Americans have served as Peace Corps Volunteers in 139 developing countries that have requested assistance.  <br />The Peace Corps mission is to promote world peace and friendship through service to others.  Peace Corps Volunteers live and work within the community they serve abroad, learning the local language, and contributing skills.  This technical assistance is one of the three goals of the Peace Corps.  The other two revolve around cross-cultural understanding gained as the people of other countries begin to understand an American as well as the cultural experience brought back and shared when the Volunteer returns home.  More information about the Peace Corps can be found on our website at www.peacecorps.gov</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Office</span></p>
<p>The Peace Corps Office of Health Services (OHS) is requiring these services.  The mission of the Office of Health Services (OHS) is to provide quality medical and mental health services and support to the Peace Corps community through the Office of Medical Services (OMS) and the Counseling and Outreach Unit (COU).  The Office of Health Services is headed by the Associate Director for the Office of Health Services (AD/OHS). OHS is located at Peace Corps Headquarters in Washington, DC.<br />OHS provides oversight and consultation to more than 125 Medical Officers in more than 65 countries worldwide where Peace Corps Volunteers currently serve.  Medical Officers are responsible for providing direct healthcare to more than 7,000 Peace Corps Volunteers.  OHS is tasked with overseeing various Quality Improvement (QI) initiatives.  These initiatives include monitoring measures that keep a real-time, ongoing assessment of the quality of healthcare that is delivered to volunteers.<br />An integral part of OHS' QI initiatives includes the reporting of Sentinel Events.  OHS defines Sentinel Events as an event in which a Volunteer may have been harmed or injured during their Peace Corps service.  Review and discussion of these events may trigger further investigation.  The resulting reports and documents require an objective analysis of the circumstances leading up to the event in order to determine if it was preventable and to recommend further steps to prevent recurrence. <br />As an independent federal agency, the Peace Corps Office of Health Services is not part of a larger federal healthcare system.  Recently, OHS has instituted and formalized its QI activities.  OHS now generates Patient Safety Work Product (PSWPs) to help the Peace Corps review its medical operations and guidelines, which may drive process revisions.  A Patient Safety Organizations (PSO) provides a secure environment where clinicians and healthcare organizations can collect, aggregate, and analyze data.  A PSO may also help to identify areas of improvement and offer resources for implementation of recommendations.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Request for Information (RFI)</span></p>
<p>The US Peace Corps is performing market research.  Peace Corps is seeking information from current Patient Safety Organizations (PSO) to assist in the Market Research efforts for Quality Improvement (QI ) through the development of Patient Safety Work Products (PSWP).

<SOLNBR>G14PS00208
<CONTACT>Andres Castro

<a href="mailto:acastro@usgs.gov">acastro@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>The USGS has a requirement for a firm-fixed price purchase order for a web dashboard, a highly visual electronic report about the health of the Gulf of Maine and restoration efforts conducted from 1990 to 2014, and materials repurposed to reach families and youth about the importance of protecting the Gulf of Maine and its fragile natural resources.
Period of Performance will be date of award through 09/30/2014. 
The products will take full advantage of and build upon Federal, State, tribal, regional, and local data. These products are requested by the Coastal and Marine Geology Program Office, Natural Hazards Mission Area, U.S. Geological Survey. The USGS and its federal partners NOAA and EPA are concerned about ensuring data, tools, and scientific analyses about the Gulf of Maine incorporate the full spectrum of regional and cumulative impacts of ecosystem-based management, including habitat restoration, changing coastal development, and alternative future scenarios related to sea level rise and climate change. The transboundary nature of the Gulf of Maine necessitates including proprietary data, tools and lessons learned from New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Environment Canada as well as the states of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. These government entities are the primary member organizations of the Gulf of Maine Council. 
The USGS is aware of no other source that can provide the above. Therefore, it intends to make an award to the Gulf of Maine Association (GOMA), unless it is contacted by any who believes they have obtained similar technical expertise and can provide the same service. Vendors are invited to contact the Contract Specialist, Andres Castro via email at acastro@usgs.gov no later than 12:00 PM EDT, Monday, March 17, 2014 with an affirmative answer. 
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) considers employee signatures to be Personal Protected Information, and therefore all employee signatures have been redacted. By posting this document, the Contracting Officer attests all appropriate signatures have been obtained. 
The Gulf of Maine Association (GOMA) has a unique regional capacity to draw upon U.S. and Canadian experts to write, edit for scientific literacy, design print, electronic and web products, and ensure compliance with both U.S. and Canadian copyright and attribution requirements for data, graphs, charts, and other visual materials.  
The GOMA through its relationship with the Gulf of Maine Council has: (a)	Access to proprietary data from the Government of Canada and the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia critical to populating climate features available through the web dash board.  Proprietary data will be used for analysis of environmental health trends in the Gulf of Maine and its watersheds.  These analyses will include water quality trends from the Canadian watersheds flowing into the northern section of the Gulf of Maine and for articulation of trends related to impacts of coastal development and eutrophication. (b)	Has capabilities, unlike companies analyzed through market research, to permanently host the web dashboard and electronic publications and to provide long term maintenance and updates over time for these products. This use of the Gulf of Maine Council's information and data portal relieves the USGS of the burden of maintaining and updating dynamic products. 

The GOMA has experience and access to the aforementioned organizations and resources to quickly pull together representatives within the Gulf of Maine to look at cross-jurisdiction issues related to building resilience to impacts of climate change.  GOMA is able to network with other regional ocean partnerships, such as the Northeast Regional Ocean Council for which it serves as fiscal agent.  GOMA has a satisfactory track record of engaging top quality researchers, writers and designers to produce scientific and communication documents about science issues, focused on the citizens and visitors to the Gulf of Maine.

<DESC><br />GPO requires the services of a contractor that will provide commercially off-the-shelf (COTS) technology with minimal customization to develop, integrate, and deploy a functioning WMS (Warehouse Management System). <br /><br />The US Government Printing Office (GPO) strives to meet our customer expectations for products and services by streamlining operations and improving system capabilities. The GPO is tasked with the effective and efficient movement of production materials of the receiving, storing and issuing items to production areas. These materials need to be accurately tracked, and issued on-time while using the available labor force effectively to meet the demands and workload from the Legislative Branch of the Federal Government and Executive Branch agencies. Therefore, the GPO seeks to modernize its paper-driven warehouse management process to a paperless warehouse management system (WMS). The paperless warehouse management system will enable real-time data entry of receipts and issues, drive visibility of material inventory and demand trends for supervision, and improve coordination of material movements and physical counts with available warehouse personnel.<br />The GPO anticipates the internal drive to improve accuracy, speed, and the cost in material inventory management. This will increase as GPO transitions from long runs on web offset printing to short runs on digital printing. The number of inventory transactions will grow as digital printing increases.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.81 per hour or $152.40 per week or $660.40 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<br />Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) APPLICABLE TO AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS ONLY - NIGHT DIFFERENTIAL: An employee is<br />entitled to pay for all work performed between the hours of 6:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M.<br />at the rate of basic pay plus a night pay differential amounting to 10 percent of<br />the rate of basic pay.</p>
<p>3) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

If the offeror is unable to meet one or more of the requirements, a page entitled  quote mark EXCEPTIONS quote mark  shall be provided with its offer which lists the requirement(s) in which the offeror is unable to meet.  Offerors shall BE AWARE that any EXCEPTION to the government's PWS may deem the offeror non-responsive and thereby will be considered ineligible for award. <br>  <br> (b) The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all ordering periods to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the ordering period prices are significantly unbalanced. The government will also evaluate its option to extend services (see FAR Clause 52.217-8) by adding six (6) months of the offeror's final price to the offeror's total price.

The Government will use information obtained using other sources, such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) or similar systems.

Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.</p>

If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.  Quoter certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes. <BR> <BR>The contract price includes all applicable Federal, state, and local taxes and duties. <BR> <BR>FOB Destination CONUS (Continental U.S.) <BR> <BR>The contractor shall stamp or mark the supplies delivered or otherwise furnish notice with the supplies of the existence of a warranty.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC). The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price.  Multiple awards will not be made; therefore, quotes that cover less than all the items and quantities in this solicitation will be rejected as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable and whether the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance.  If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.  Quoter certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes. <BR> <BR>The contract price includes all applicable Federal, state, and local taxes and duties. <BR> <BR>FOB Destination CONUS (Continental U.S.) <BR> <BR>The contractor shall stamp or mark the supplies delivered or otherwise furnish notice with the supplies of the existence of a warranty.

Additionally, if the successful offeror selected as the primary contractor is not the actual hosting facility, the primary contractor in this case shall be required to have an employee onsite during the entire time period of the event to provide for, and maintain the privity of contract relationship with the Government to manage the onsite activities on behalf of the contractor and the Government in dealing with the hosting facility and management.</p>

<p>ATTACHMENT A<br />PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT<br />ASSISTANCE TO FIREFIGHTERS PROGRAM OFFICE'S<br />FIRE PREVENTION AND SAFETY FY2013 APPLICATION REVIEW</p>
<p><br />I. Background</p>
<p>The Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program Office operates under the authority of FEMA's Grant Programs Directorate within the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>The Fire Prevention and Safety application period was initiated on February 18, 2014. This program generates thousands of applications with the program consistently receiving around 3,000 applications each year. This grant opportunity is competitive and each application must be evaluated independently against established criteria in order to assure fair and equitable opportunity for each. This independent evaluation is conducted by a panel of subject matter specialists who are flown in for one week to review and evaluate the applications.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish the panel reviews, the Government will need to secure commercial conference space. Due to the dates required, Federal facility space is not available. The panel reviews are scheduled to be conducted the week of March 30. 2014 through April 4, 2014. The review panel will consist of as many as 150 subject matter specialists who will be supported by as many as 38 Federal and contract support staff.</p>
<p>II. Scope of Work</p>
<p>The government requires facility space to conduct FY2013 Fire Prevention and Safety panel reviews during the scheduled week of March 30, 2014 to April 4, 2014.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES AUTHORIZED IN FAR PART 13. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) number is NRMAC100-14-00604-CBB. This synopsis/solicitation constitutes a RFQ and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-63.  The FSC code for this action is 6120.  The NAICS code for this action is 334519 -- Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing.
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA/OAR/ARL/ATDD, has a requirement for two (2) methanol fuel cell generators equivalent to EFOY Pro 2400 manufactured by SFC of Germany (as specified below).</p>
<p>Our requirements for a methanol fuel cell generator include the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	Operation in temperatures as low as -55&deg;C.- Alaska's front range can experience temperatures as low as -60&deg;C and as high as 30&deg;C when packaged in a well-insulated in-house produced enclosure.  Unit will maintain a minimum internal temperature to restart and remain reliable under extreme weather conditions.</p>
<p>&bull;	Produces 12 VDC nominal and at least 800 Watts per day- The USCRN AK stations are powered by a 12 VDC.  The system requires a minimum of 288 Watts per day in optimum conditions.  Adding a general efficiency factor and allowing for power drops due to the cold temperatures, the power system needs to produce a minimum of 800 Watts per day.</p>
<p>&bull;	Lightweight (less than 500 lbs total plus fuel) and easy to install- The USCRN AK stations are in remote locations requiring transportation via small aircraft and manual lifting.  A small and light power system is essential.  A system that breaks down into components that weigh less than 150 lbs is a requirement.  Also, the system needs to be installed in a very short time.  Time spent in the remote areas of Alaska is very expensive.</p>
<p>&bull;	Uses minimal fuel to power due to remote nature of the sites &lt;1.5 l/kWhr-  The USCRN AK stations are located in remote areas where even common fossil fuels are not available or are extremely expensive to transport.  A system that utilizes a small amount of fuel is a requirement.</p>
<p>&bull;	Must run continuously or be able to restart in all conditions-The USCRN AK stations require a consistent power source.  The stations can only survive for six to eight days without input power.  This requires a system that can restart or run continuously in the extremely frigid environment.</p>
<p><br />Offers will be evaluated based on price and the factors set forth in paragraph (a), an award will be made to the firm who can meet the specific requirements and is most advantageous to the Government considering price and other price related factors. A good faith estimate of ground shipping to our facility located at 456 S. Illinois Ave., Oak Ridge, TN 37830 should be provided, as only actual shipping costs confirmed by freight weigh bill and invoice will be reimbursed.  If handling charges or fees are included, they should be a separate line item.</p>
<p>The Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD) requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Systems for Award Management (SAM). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in SAM. For additional information and to register in SAM please access the following website: http://www.sam.gov/.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>Technical Approach<br />Price</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF QUOTE:</p>
<p>52.212-2: Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Contractor whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be the best value to the Government- price and other factors considered. Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than Price.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:</p>
<p>A. Quality of the technical quote and turnaround time; its clarity and demonstrated ability to perform the research in a timely manner. Evaluation shall assess the detailed technical description of how all the required work will be accomplished. This will include evaluation of the literature review, data sources, and methodologies proposed for analysis and their appropriateness to the overall research being conducted relevant to the PWS. In addition, the project timeline will be assessed to assure that the research report is completed in a timely manner and consistent with the methodologies prescribed in the quote. Researchers whose quotes include surveys should be mindful of the Paperwork Reduction Act and OMB clearance. For a good or excellent evaluation, the quote must show the ability to accomplish the desired results and demonstrate the quality of work in providing services in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>The following rating method shall be used in the evaluation of the technical approach information:</p>
<p>Excellent - Based on the quote's technical approach, no doubt exists that the quote will successfully perform the required effort. The technical approach shows a complete understanding and methodology<br />for completing the PWS within the standards and workload specified.<br />Good - Based on the quote's technical approach, little doubt exists that the quote will successfully perform the required effort.

The technical approach demonstrates significant deficiencies in understanding and implementing performance of the PWS within the standards and workload specified.</p>
<p>B. Researcher qualifications, experience (including past performance), if applicable and knowledge of literature in this field. The evaluation will be based on the information obtained in the quote and, when necessary, from other references provided by the quote. It will also look at other relevant past performance information. The evaluation will consider: (1) the qualifications of the researcher(s) relevant to the analysis being performed in the quote and (2) knowledge and previous experience in researching the topic as stated in the PWS. The Government will assess the relevant risks associated with each quote to determine technical acceptance. Performance risks are those associated with an quote's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that quote's record of past performance and knowledge and experience of the research in the fields relevant to this PWS.</p>
<p>For those quoters who have prior contractual experience, the Government will focus on the past performance as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as cost, schedule and performance, including standards of good workmanship; the quote's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the quote's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the quote's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. The Government will consider the number or severity of an quote's problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken, the quote's overall work record, and the age and relevance of past performance information.</p>
<p>The following rating method shall be used in the evaluation of the technical approach information:<br />Excellent - Based on the quote's past performance record and/or qualifications and knowledge of the field, no doubt exists that the quote will successfully perform the required effort of the PWS. <br />Good- Based on the quote's past performance record and/or qualifications and knowledge of the field, little doubt exists that the quote will successfully perform the required effort of the PWS.<br />Marginal- Based on the quote's past performance record and/or qualifications and knowledge of the field, some doubt exists that the quote will successfully perform the required effort of the PWS. <br />Poor- Based on the quote's past performance record and/or qualifications and knowledge of the field, serious doubts exists that the quote will successfully perform the required effort of the PWS.</p>
<p>C. Probability that this research will make a fundamental contribution to the literature, produce an innovative concept or idea, offer policy relevant results, or develop new ground that has previously not been fully mined or understood. The evaluation will assess the quality of the quote based on its overall potential contribution to the literature in terms of innovativeness, policy relevance, or furthering the debate.</p>
<p>The following rating method shall be used in the evaluation of the technical approach information:<br />Excellent - Based on the quote's quote, no doubt exists that the quote's quote will make a fundamental contribution to the literature, produce an innovative concept or idea, or develop new ground that has previously not been fully mined or understood. <br />Good - Based on the quote's quote, little doubt exists that the quote's quote will make a fundamental contribution to the literature, produce an innovative concept or idea, or develop new ground that has previously not been fully mined or understood. <br />Marginal - Based on the quote's quote, some doubt exists that the quote's quote will make a fundamental contribution to the literature, produce an innovative concept or idea, or develop new ground that has previously not been fully mined or understood.<br />Poor - Based on the quote's quote, serious doubt exist that the quote's quote will make a fundamental contribution to the literature, produce an innovative concept or idea, or develop new ground that has previously not been</p>
<p>PRICE:</p>
<p>Reasonableness: The Government will evaluate price and determine price reasonableness based on comparative, competitive pricing among the quotes received as compared to the Government's own Independent Cost Estimate. The reasonableness of proposed price and shall also be assessed by the acceptability of the Contractor's methodology used in developing the price estimates. For the price to be reasonable, in its nature and amount, it should be commensurate with what would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of a competitive business. Only reasonable quotes will be considered for award. Unreasonably high or low quotes present a risk to the government in achieving a best-value solution and, therefore, will not be considered.</p>
<p>Other relevant information to consider when submitting a quote:</p>
<p>1. Research quotes should include a review of the literature, establish a set of hypotheses to be tested, describe the model, describe the data to test the model, show the policy relevance of the research, list a time line and provide cost information.<br />2. Some data sources require special access due to privacy concerns. Quoters must sufficiently show how they would gain access to such data if they were to be awarded a contract. If applicable, quotes should include the cost of acquiring or using any databases or data lists.<br />3. Quotes that include uses of additional survey(s) for information should demonstrate familiarity with survey procedures, provide the source for respondents, provide collection details and provide realistic estimates of the response rates. Quotes suggesting surveys need to include the survey approval process in the timeline as required under the Paperwork Reduction Act's clearance process within the Office of Management and Budget. Surveys are not preferred over using existing data, as they can place a burden on small businesses, but we recognize that on occasion they are necessary.<br />4. Previously completed research funded by the Office of Advocacy can give researchers perspective when creating quotes. See http://www.sba.gov/advo/research.</p>
<p>A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS (IF &gt;$25K)</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<p>7. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>8. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Chad.B.Davis@uscg.mil. Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>9. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 1200 Pacific Time on 03/21/ 2013</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Administrative Program Specialist will be based in Washington, DC, and will provide a range of administrative and/or program services in support of OTI program-funded staff in Washington and the field.  The Administrative Program Specialist will work within OTI's Operations and Management Division (OMD), Field Programs Division (FPD), or Program, Learning, and Innovation Division (PLI).  The Administrative Program Specialist's supervisor will be determined upon hiring. Given the contingent, operational, and flexible nature of OTI's political transition work overseas, the Administrative Program Specialist may be required to move from one OTI division or team to another (including within and between OMD, FPD, and PLI) depending on the operational and programmatic needs of the office.  All Administrative Program Specialist positions are comprised of administrative support tasks, though each Administrative Program Specialist's duties may be concentrated in different areas related to the Scope of Work.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The purpose of this solicitation is to hire Administrative Program Specialists within OTI's Operations and Management Division (OMD).</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Administrative Program Specialist requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation.   The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  She or he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.  The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Administrative Program Specialist is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Team Leader for the team to which he/she is assigned, or his/her designee, the Administrative Program Specialist will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide knowledge management support such as tracking documents, lessons learned, best practices across OTI programs and/or operations as required. Assist teams in the creation and/or maintenance of information products in support of political transition programs;</p>

<p>&bull;	Provide program finance and budget management and planning;</p>

Backstop other Admin and Program Assistants on other teams when required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide personnel support for program funded staff, including but not limited to travel assistance, training logistics assistance, submitting personnel action requests, payroll support, maintaining working personnel files in hard copy and on-line, maintaining a staff hiring tracker and temporary duty (TDY) scheduler, drafting and tracking personnel memos, and other personnel support duties as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide general administrative support for the supervisor and program-funded staff such as: scheduling and facilitating meetings, drafting meeting minutes, tracking and ensuring action items are followed up, scheduling and meeting logistics preparation, filing, correspondence control, and other administrative services as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide training, orientation, and mentoring for new staff who have since on-boarded as delegated; communicate with supervisor to recognize good performance and communicate where performance needs to be improved.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>

<DESC>1.) The closing date of this solicitation is hereby extended until 7 April 2014.
<p>2.) Please replace pages 7-8 of the original solicitation with all pages of the subject amendment. PLEASE COMPLETE THE PRICING SECTION OF THIS AMENDMENT AND RESUBMIT WITH THE REMAINING PAGES OF THE ORIGINAL SOLICTIATION.</p>
<p>3.) The REVISED Technical documents (Ordering Data, NAVSUP WSS PD-511, NAVSUP WSS-TD-1), are attached</p>
<p>4.) Solicitation is being amended to incorporate a Government First Article Test for an additional Electromagnetic Interference Testing (EMI) requirement. This requirement will be covered under CLIN 0010 (Government First Article Test). The original solicitation CLIN 0007 is still valid and requires that the subject item meet the requirements of MIL-STD-461. CLIN 0010 is now being incorporated into the solicitation in order to meet the requirements of Table 1 of MIL-STD-464 (Electromagnetic Environmental Effects Requirements For Systems).</p>
<p>Note: The only capable Hi-Shock Test lab (CLIN 0006) is located in Arvonia, VA, which is roughly 100 miles away. If you schedule correctly you will be able to have the truck tested for EMI in Dahlgren and subsequently transported to the Arvonia for the Hi-Shock Test; thereby minimizing transportation costs.<br /><br />5.) Solicitation is also being amended to provide additional guidance on the testing requirements of original Contractor Electromagnetic Interference Testing (EMI), I/A/W MIL-STD-461. This requirement is still covered under CLIN 0007. Government is requesting that the following information be included in the proposed test procedures and be performed during testing.</p>
<p>- RE101, RE102, RS101 &amp; RS103 Operating Modes: For the emissions and susceptibility testing we are requiring that the test be performed with the "ENGINE ON". Having the "engine on" will allow us to capture any of its emissions and verify that any of the vehicle controls are not susceptible to the susceptibility stimulus. The testing company may elect to have the truck raised or have the test performed with the transmission disconnected from the axle(s) so that no positive force shall have the chance to be transmitted from the transmission. That a video camera be present to see if that force is present.</p>
<p>- RE101 - The test plan shall mention a determination of a "mitigation distance" for any RE101 failures. This must be included in the test plan and performed during testing.</p>

The Contractor shall take all reasonable steps and precautions to prevent accidents, and preserve and protect personnel and property.

It is the Contractor?s responsibility to assure all personnel scheduled to work on the installation have acceptable backgrounds. <BR> <BR>Access to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) requires that Contractor employees voluntarily submit personal data (e.g., name, social security number, etc.) when applying for a DPG Identification Card or temporary access pass.

Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground.

(b) To comply with this statute, the Government has conducted a best efforts screening of the specifications and standards associated with this acquisition to determine whether they contain any ODS requirements. To the extent that ODS requirements were revealed by this review, they are identified in Section C or the statement of work of this document. (c) If offerors possess any special knowledge about any other ODS required directly or indirectly at any level of contract performance, the U.S. Army would appreciated if such information was surfaced to the Contracting Officer for appropriate action. To preclude delay to the procurement, offerors should provide any information as soon as possible after release of the solicitation and prior to the submission of offers to the extent practicable. It should be understood that there is no obligation on offerors to comply with this request and that no compensation can be provided for doing so. <BR> <BR>Manufacturer or supplier must ensure that all OSHA standards applicable to that which is being purchased are complied with. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access.

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate, and to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established five regional offices in the following locations: San Jose, Costa Rica; Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Pretoria, South Africa; and Bangkok, Thailand.  OFDA also has other, smaller sub-regional and program offices around the world.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs) who report to the Disaster Response Team Leaders in Washington. PRAs serve as the regional team leader for all response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. They primarily serve as the key interlocutor with embassies and missions in the event of a disaster but may also serve as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) leader if needed.  They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional offices, as appropriate, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Washington-based Team Leaders, the multi-year non-response program strategies for their respective regions.  The PRAs coordinate with OFDA/Washington on disaster response activities, determine program priorities, and identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for their respective regions.  The Regional Advisors report to the PRAs.  They ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster response and assistance, strategic reporting and analysis are met. The Regional Advisors are responsible for monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded programs and activities, and formulating disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of a Regional Advisor based in Maputo, Mozambique, to ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster assistance, risk reduction, resilience programming, strategic reporting, and interagency coordination for the Southern Africa region, are met.</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>INTERAGENCY LANGUAGE ROUNDTABLE LANGUAGE SKILL LEVEL DESCRIPTIONS</p>
<p>SPEAKING:<br />Speaking 0 (No Proficiency) Unable to function in the spoken language. Oral production is limited to occasional isolated words. Has essentially no communicative ability.</p>
<p>Speaking 0+ (Memorized Proficiency) Able to satisfy immediate needs using rehearsed utterances. Shows little real autonomy of expression, flexibility or spontaneity. Can ask questions or make statements with reasonable accuracy only with memorized utterances or formulae. Attempts at creating speech are usually unsuccessful. Examples:  The individual's vocabulary is usually limited to areas of immediate survival needs.</p>
<p>Speaking 1 (Elementary Proficiency) Able to satisfy minimum courtesy requirements and maintain very simple face-to-face conversations on familiar topics. A native speaker must often use slowed speech, repetition, paraphrase, or a combination of these to be understood by this individual. Similarly, the native speaker must strain and employ real-world knowledge to understand even simple statements/questions from this individual. This speaker has a functional, but limited proficiency. Misunderstandings are frequent, but the individual is able to ask for help and to verify comprehension of native speech in face-to-face interaction. The individual is unable to produce continuous discourse except with rehearsed material. Examples:  Structural accuracy is likely to be random or severely limited. Time concepts are vague. Vocabulary is inaccurate, and its range is very narrow. The individual often speaks with great difficulty. By repeating, such speakers can make themselves understood to native speakers who are in regular contact with foreigners but there is little precision in the information conveyed. Needs, experience or training may vary greatly from individual to individual; for example, speakers at this level may have encountered quite different vocabulary areas. However, the individual can typically satisfy predictable, simple, personal and accommodation needs; can generally meet courtesy, introduction, and identification requirements; exchange greetings; elicit and provide, for example, predictable and skeletal biographical information. He/she might give information about business hours, explain routine procedures in a limited way. and state in a simple manner what actions will be taken. He/she is able to formulate some questions even in languages with complicated question constructions. Almost every utterance may be characterized by structural errors and errors in basic grammatical relations. Vocabulary is extremely limited and characteristically does not include modifiers. Pronunciation, stress, and intonation are generally poor, often heavily influenced by another language. Use of structure and vocabulary is highly imprecise.</p>
<p>Speaking 1+ (Elementary Proficiency, Plus) Can initiate and maintain predictable face-to-face conversations and satisfy limited social demands. He/she may, however, have little understanding of the social conventions of conversation. The interlocutor is generally required to strain and employ real-world knowledge to understand even some simple speech. The speaker at this level may hesitate and may have to change subjects due to lack of language resources. Range and control of the language are limited. Speech largely consists of a series of short, discrete utterances. Examples:  The individual is able to satisfy most travel and accommodation needs and a limited range of social demands beyond exchange of skeletal biographic information. Speaking ability may extend beyond immediate survival needs. Accuracy in basic grammatical relations is evident, although not consistent. May exhibit the more common forms of verb tenses, for example, but may make frequent errors in formation and selection. While some structures are established, errors occur in more complex patterns. The individual typically cannot sustain coherent structures in longer utterances or unfamiliar situations. Ability to describe and give precise information is limited. Person, space and time references are often used incorrectly. Pronunciation is understandable to natives used to dealing with foreigners. Can combine most significant sounds with reasonable comprehensibility, but has difficulty in producing certain sounds in certain positions or in certain combinations. Speech will usually be labored. Frequently has to repeat utterances to be understood by the general public.</p>
<p>Speaking 2 (Limited Working Proficiency) Able to satisfy routine social demands and limited work requirements. Can handle routine work-related interactions that are limited in scope. In more complex and sophisticated work-related tasks, language usage generally disturbs the native speaker. Can handle with confidence, but not with facility, most normal, high-frequency social conversational situations including extensive, but casual conversations about current events, as well as work, family, and autobiographical information. The individual can get the gist of most everyday conversations but has some difficulty understanding native speakers in situations that require specialized or sophisticated knowledge. The individual's utterances are minimally cohesive. Linguistic structure is usually not very elaborate and not thoroughly controlled; errors are frequent. Vocabulary use is appropriate for high-frequency utterances, but unusual or imprecise elsewhere. Examples:  While these interactions will vary widely from individual to individual, the individual can typically ask and answer predictable questions in the workplace and give straightforward instructions to subordinates. Additionally, the individual can participate in personal and accommodation-type interactions with elaboration and facility; that is, can give and understand complicated, detailed, and extensive directions and make non-routine changes in travel and accommodation arrangements. Simple structures and basic grammatical relations are typically controlled; however, there are areas of weakness. In the commonly taught languages, these may be simple markings such as plurals, articles, linking words, and negatives or more complex structures such as tense/aspect usage, case morphology. passive constructions, word order, and embedding.</p>
<p>Speaking 2+ (Limited Working Proficiency, Plus) Able to satisfy most work requirements with language usage that is often, but not always, acceptable and effective. The individual shows considerable ability to communicate effectively on topics relating to particular interests and special fields of competence. Often shows a high degree of fluency and ease of speech, yet when under tension or pressure, the ability to use the language effectively may deteriorate. Comprehension of normal native speech is typically nearly complete. The individual may miss cultural and local references and may require a native speaker to adjust to his/her limitations in some ways. Native speakers often perceive the individual's speech to contain awkward or inaccurate phrasing of ideas, mistaken time, space and person references, or to be in some way inappropriate, if not strictly incorrect. Examples:  Typically the individual can participate in most social, formal, and informal interactions, but limitations either in range of contexts, types of tasks or level of accuracy hinder effectiveness. The individual may be ill at ease with the use of the language either in social interaction or in speaking at length in professional contexts. He/she is generally strong in either structural precision or vocabulary, but not in both. Weakness or unevenness in one of the foregoing, or in pronunciation, occasionally results in miscommunication. Normally controls, but cannot always easily produce general vocabulary. Discourse is often incohesive.</p>
<p>Speaking 3 (General Professional Proficiency) Able to speak the language with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations in practical, social and professional topics. Nevertheless, the individual's limitations generally restrict the professional contexts of language use to matters of shared knowledge and/or international convention. Discourse is cohesive. The individual uses the language acceptably, but with some noticeable imperfections; yet, errors virtually never interfere with understanding and rarely disturb the native speaker. The individual can effectively combine structure and vocabulary to convey his/her meaning accurately. The individual speaks readily and fills pauses suitably. In face-to-face conversation with natives speaking the standard dialect at a normal rate of speech, comprehension is quite complete. Although cultural references, proverbs and the implications of nuances and idiom may not be fully understood, the individual can easily repair the conversation. Pronunciation may be obviously foreign. Individual sounds are accurate: but stress, intonation and pitch control may be faulty. Examples:  Can typically discuss particular interests and special fields of competence with reasonable ease. Can use the language as part of normal professional duties such as answering objections, clarifying points, justifying decisions, understanding the essence of challenges, stating and defending policy, conducting meetings, delivering briefings, or other extended and elaborate informative monologues. Can reliably elicit information and informed opinion from native speakers. Structural inaccuracy is rarely the major cause of misunderstanding. Use of structural devices is flexible and elaborate. Without searching for words or phrases, the individual uses the language clearly and relatively naturally to elaborate concepts freely and make ideas easily understandable to native speakers. Errors occur in low-frequency and highly complex structures.</p>
<p>Speaking 3+ (General Professional Proficiency, Plus) Is often able to use the language to satisfy professional needs in a wide range of sophisticated and demanding tasks. Examples:  Despite obvious strengths, may exhibit some hesitancy, uncertainty, effort or errors which limit the range of language-use tasks that can be reliably performed. Typically there is particular strength in fluency and one or more, but not all, of the following: breadth of lexicon, including low- and medium-frequency items, especially socio-linguistic/cultural references and nuances of close synonyms; structural precision, with sophisticated features that are readily, accurately and appropriately controlled (such as complex modification and embedding in Indo-European languages); discourse competence in a wide range of contexts and tasks, often matching a native speaker's strategic and organizational abilities and expectations. Occasional patterned errors occur in low frequency and highly-complex structures.</p>
<p>Speaking 4 (Advanced Professional Proficiency) Able to use the language fluently and accurately on all levels normally pertinent to professional needs. The individual's language usage and ability to function are fully successful. Organizes discourse well, using appropriate rhetorical speech devices, native cultural references and understanding. Language ability only rarely hinders him/her in performing any task requiring language; yet, the individual would seldom be perceived as a native. Speaks effortlessly and smoothly and is able to use the language with a high degree of effectiveness, reliability and precision for all representational purposes within the range of personal and professional experience and scope of responsibilities. Can serve as in informal interpreter in a range of unpredictable circumstances. Can perform extensive, sophisticated language tasks, encompassing most matters of interest to well-educated native speakers, including tasks which do not bear directly on a professional specialty. Examples:  Can discuss in detail concepts which are fundamentally different from those of the target culture and make those concepts clear and accessible to the native speaker. Similarly, the individual can understand the details and ramifications of concepts that are culturally or conceptually different from his/her own. Can set the tone of interpersonal official, semi-official and non-professional verbal exchanges with a representative range of native speakers (in a range of varied audiences, purposes, tasks and settings). Can play an effective role among native speakers in such contexts as conferences, lectures and debates on matters of disagreement. Can advocate a position at length, both formally and in chance encounters, using sophisticated verbal strategies. Understands and reliably produces shifts of both subject matter and tone. Can understand native speakers of the standard and other major dialects in essentially any face-to-face interaction.</p>
<p>Speaking 4+ (Advanced Professional Proficiency, Plus) Speaking proficiency is regularly superior in all respects, usually equivalent to that of a well educated, highly articulate native speaker. Language ability does not impede the performance of any language-use task. However, the individual would not necessarily be perceived as culturally native. Examples:  The individual organizes discourse well. employing functional rhetorical speech devices, native cultural references and understanding. Effectively applies a native speaker's social and circumstantial knowledge; however, cannot sustain that performance under all circumstances. While the individual has a wide range and control of structure, an occasional nonnative slip may occur. The individual has a sophisticated control of vocabulary and phrasing that is rarely imprecise, yet there are occasional weaknesses in idioms, colloquialisms, pronunciation, cultural reference or there may be an occasional failure to interact in a totally native manner.</p>
<p>Speaking 5 (Functionally Native Proficiency) Speaking proficiency is functionally equivalent to that of a highly articulate well-educated native speaker and reflects the cultural standards of the country where the language is natively spoken. The individual uses the language with complete flexibility and intuition, so that speech on all levels is fully accepted by well-educated native speakers in all of its features, including breadth of vocabulary and idiom, colloquialisms and pertinent cultural references. Pronunciation is typically consistent with that of well-educated native speakers of a non-stigmatized dialect.</p>
<p>WRITING:<br />Writing 0 (No Proficiency) No functional writing ability.</p>
<p>Writing 0+ (Memorized Proficiency) Writes using memorized material and set expressions. Can produce symbols in an alphabetic or syllabic writing system or 50 of the most common characters. Can write numbers and dates, own name, nationality, address, etc., such as on a hotel registration form. Otherwise, ability to write is limited to simple lists of common items such as a few short sentences. Spelling and even representation of symbols (letters, syllables, characters) may be incorrect.</p>
<p>Writing 1 (Elementary Proficiency) Has sufficient control of the writing system to meet limited practical needs. Can create by writing statements and questions on topics very familiar to him/her within the scope of his/her very limited language experience. Writing vocabulary is inadequate to express anything but elementary needs; writes in simple sentences making continual errors in spelling, grammar and punctuation but writing can be read and understood by a native reader used to dealing with foreigners attempting to write his/her language. Writing tends to be a loose collection of sentences (or fragments) on a given topic and provides little evidence of conscious organization. While topics which are "very familiar" and elementary needs vary considerably from individual to individual, any person at this level should be able to write simple phone messages, excuses, notes to service people and simple notes to friends.</p>
<p>Writing 1+ (Elementary Proficiency, Plus) Sufficient control of writing system to meet most survival needs and limited social demands. Can create sentences and short paragraphs related to most survival needs (food, lodging, transportation, immediate surroundings and situations) and limited social demands. Can express fairly accurate present and future time. Can produce some past verb forms but not always accurately or with correct usage. Can relate personal history, discuss topics such as daily life, preferences and very familiar material. Shows good control of elementary vocabulary and some control of basic syntactic patterns but major errors still occur when expressing more complex thoughts. Dictionary usage may still yield incorrect vocabulary or terms, although the individual can use a dictionary to advantage to express simple ideas. Generally cannot use basic cohesive elements of discourse to advantage (such as relative constructions, object pronouns, connectors, etc.). Can take notes in some detail on familiar topics, and respond to personal questions using elementary vocabulary and common structures. Can write simple letters, summaries of biographical data and work experience with fair accuracy. Writing, though faulty, is comprehensible to native speakers used to dealing with foreigners.</p>
<p>Writing 2 (Limited Working Proficiency) Able to write routine social correspondence and prepare documentary materials required for most limited work requirements. Has writing vocabulary sufficient to express himself/herself simply with some circumlocutions. Can write simply about a very limited number of current events or daily situations. Still makes common errors in spelling and punctuation, but shows some control of the most common formats and punctuation conventions. Good control of morphology of language (in inflected languages) and of the most frequently used syntactic structures. Elementary constructions are usually handled quite accurately and writing is understandable to a native reader not used to reading the writing of foreigners. Uses a limited number of cohesive devices.</p>
<p>Writing 2+ (Limited Working Proficiency, Plus) Shows ability to write with some precision and in some detail about most common topics. Can write about concrete topics relating to particular interests and special fields of competence. Often shows surprising fluency and ease of expression but under time constraints and pressure language may be inaccurate and/or incomprehensible. Generally strong in either grammar or vocabulary but not in both. Weaknesses or unevenness in one of the foregoing or in spelling result in occasional miscommunication. Areas of weakness range from simple constructions such as plurals, articles, prepositions and negatives to more complex structures such as tense usage, passive constructions, word order and relative clauses. Normally controls general vocabulary with some misuse of everyday vocabulary evident. Shows a limited ability to use circumlocutions Uses dictionary to advantage to supply unknown words. Can take fairly accurate notes on material presented orally and handle with fair accuracy most social correspondence. Writing is understandable to native speakers not used to dealing with foreigners' attempts to write the language, though style is still obviously foreign.</p>
<p>Writing 3 (General Professional Proficiency) Able to use the language effectively in most formal and informal written exchanges on practical, social and professional topics. Can write reports, summaries, short library research papers on current events, on particular areas of interest or on special fields with reasonable ease. Control of structure, spelling and general vocabulary is adequate to convey his/her message accurately but style may be obviously foreign. Errors virtually never interfere with comprehension and rarely disturb the native reader. Punctuation generally controlled Employs a full range of structures. Control of grammar good with only sporadic errors in basic structures, occasional errors in the most complex frequent structures and somewhat more frequent errors in low frequency complex structures. Consistent control of compound and complex sentences. Relationship of ideas is consistently clear.</p>
<p>Writing 3+ (General Professional Proficiency, Plus) Able to write the language in a few prose styles pertinent to professional/educational needs. Not always able to tailor language to suit audience Weaknesses may he in poor control of low frequency complex structures. vocabulary or the ability to express subtleties and nuances. May be able to write on some topics pertinent to professional/educational needs. Organization may suffer due to lack of variety in organizational patterns or in variety of cohesive devices.</p>
<p>Writing 4 (Advanced Professional Proficiency) Able to write the language precisely and accurately in a variety of prose styles pertinent to professional/educational needs. Errors of grammar are rare including those in low frequency complex structures. Consistently able to tailor language to suit audience and able to express subtleties and nuances. Expository prose is clearly, consistently and explicitly organized. The writer employs a variety of organizational patterns, uses a wide variety of cohesive devices such as ellipses and parallelisms, and subordinates in a variety of ways. Able to write on all topics normally pertinent to professional and educational needs and on social issues of a general nature. Writing adequate to express all his/her experiences.</p>
<p>Writing 4+ (Advanced Professional Proficiency, Plus) Able to write the language precisely and accurately in a wide variety of prose styles pertinent to professional/educational needs. May have some ability to edit but not in the full range of styles. Has some flexibility within a style and shows some evidence of a use of stylistic devices.</p>
<p>Writing 5 (Functionally Native Proficiency) Has writing proficiency equal to that of a well educated native. Without non-native errors of structure, spelling, style or vocabulary can write and edit both formal and informal correspondence, official reports and documents, and professional/ educational articles including writing for special purposes which might include legal, technical, educational, literary and colloquial writing. In addition to being clear, explicit and informative, the writing and the ideas are also imaginative. The writer employs a very wide range of stylistic devices.</p>

The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental remediation activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Performance Work Statement. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a PBR approach to achieve minimum performance objectives and support progress to Site Closeout involving remedial action efforts at the JBCC, MA. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the POP in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental remediation activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Performance Work Statement. Reference the latest PWS dated 16 January 2014 and attachments posted to FEDBIZOPPS for the latest documents.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL:</strong></span> <br /><br />The 772 ESS/PKS intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR contract for remedial action efforts at JBCC, MA. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a FFP pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. <strong>This requirement is being issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.<br /></strong><br /><strong>Notice to Offeror(s)/Supplier(s):</strong> Funds are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date for receipt of proposals. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs. <br /><br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the fourth quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.<br /><br />Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's rough order of magnitude (ROM) for this PBR is anticipated to be between $25,000,000 and $32,000,000. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br /><br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Ms. Linda L. Cavazos. Email correspondence shall be sent to Ms. Cavazos with a copy to the contract specialist, Mr. Thomas Steinman. <br /><br /><strong>System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements:</strong> Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by the required time, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br /><br /><strong>Environmental Insurance (EI):</strong> The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.<br /><br /><strong>Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI):</strong> An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirements requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at JBCC may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br /><br /><strong>Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors.</strong> The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of amendment 0001 is to provide some additional information in response to some questions received in response to the sources sought announcement.  <br>  <br> Question 1: In looking over the list of munitions under consideration, would it be possible to get the DODICs for the munitions being considered under each family so we can evaluate the specific rounds that would be included?  <br>  <br> Answer 1: At this time we are unable to provide a listing of DODICs due to the information not being available yet.  <br>  <br> Question 2: There is also some inconsistency in the description of the 25mm and 30mm cartridges in the solicitation which states that they are HE filled, and the munitions list indicates that they are depleted uranium. The DU rounds do not have HE filler. <br>  <br> Answer 2: The MIDAS code saying DUM for those cartridges is incorrect and the cartridges are HE filled or inert slug rounds, not DU.  The table has been corrected.  <br>  <br> Question 3: Is munitions listing a CBU-88 correct? We find no information for a CBU-88 except for an obscure reference to a CBU-88/B Smokeye which was believed to contain 3 bombs each containing 72 lbs of red phosphorus. Could it possibly be the CBU-89 instead? <br>  <br> Answer 3: NO, CBU-88 is not correct.  The table has been corrected to show it should be listed as CBU-87A/B and CBU 87B/B.  <br>  <br> Question 4: Regarding the subject Sources Sought Notice, is this a new requirement or a follow-on effort? If this is a follow-on, would you please provide the incumbent contract information? <br>  <br> Answer 4: This is a new requirement.  <br>  <br> Question 5: Why are there no DPICMs identified in the tabulated listing of munitions?  <br>  <br> Answer 5: This list was representative of munitions that were being considered to allow the Army to gauge interest in future contract work and that any RFP that may result from this sources sought will contain a more definitive list of actual munitions. <br>  <br>

3/6/14 AMENDMENT A001 ISSUED TO INCLUDE CLAUSE 3.6.3-22 CONSTRUCTION WASTE MANAGEMENT IN FULL TEXT. 

3/5/14 WAGE DETERMINATION, OK140049 "BUILDING", IS REFERENCED IN SECTION J, BUT NOT ATTACHED TO FAACO ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS ACTION PROVIDES THE ATTACHMENT. 

THIS PROCUREMENT IS A 100% SET-ASIDE FOR COMPETITION LIMITED TO ELIGIBLE: 
     (1) SERVICE-DISABLED, VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES, 
     (2) SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES [8(a)] 
CERTIFIED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, AND 
     (3) OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES


LOCATION OF PROJECTS: Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, 6500 S. MacArthur Boulevard, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK: Miscellaneous general construction services are required, throughout the term of the contract, for alteration, extension, conversion, and/or modernization of existing facilities, as well as new construction. These services will be required for commercial, industrial, and utility type of facilities located at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center.  Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, and equipment required for all work as described in the applicable contract documents.

Multiple contract awards are contemplated.  Each contract will be for a 1-year base period, with three 1-year option periods to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.  Task orders will be placed against the contracts to fund construction projects throughout the year.  

Requirements under these contracts can range from $1,000-$750,000 each.  It is estimated that $8.5 million in task orders will be issued under the general construction multiple award contracts over four years.  

Request for proposals and award of task orders will be specific to projects in excess of $50,000 [Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 0001] and less than $50,000 [CLIN 0004].  

Requests for proposals for projects estimated to be greater than $50,000 will be issued to all general construction contract holders and will be accompanied by detailed specifications and construction drawings. [SIR/RFO, Section G, Clause G.1]  

As customers often require projects to be completed in an expedited manner, site visits may be scheduled within 5 days (or less) of issuance of Task Order Request for Proposals (TORFP).  Contractors must be able to respond to requests for meetings, site visits, TORFPs, task order mobilization, etc. with very little notice.  Typical response time for task order proposals is 15 days.  Regular meetings between contractors and the FAA will be scheduled at the post-award conference for each Task Order.

Expedited competitive procedures; e.g., rapid turn-around times (TAT)/completion dates, generally under 15 days, will be utilized for projects estimated to be less than $50,000.  In addition, it is anticipated that projects estimated to be less than $10,000 could be awarded by a designated Ordering Official on a more informal basis.  Approximately 150 work orders were issued at the MMAC in 2013 for general, electrical and mechanical construction projects under $50,000 each, for an estimated total of $400,000 for the year.

The Government reserves the right to solicit proposals for requirements below the $50,000.00 threshold under CLIN 0001 and requirements above the $50,000 threshold under CLIN 0004, if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government

Contractors will be allowed to submit proposals for both CLINs 0001 and 0004 (both less than and greater than $50,000), or only CLIN 0004 (less than $50,000).  [Contractors may not submit a proposal for only CLIN 0001.]  Contractors can receive a contract for both CLINs, for CLIN 0001 only, for CLIN 0004 only or none at all.  The FAA reserves the right to limit the number of awards to those that represent the best value to the Government.  However, it should be noted that a sufficient number of awards shall be made to ensure that at least two (2) of the technically qualified offerors have proposed on both CLIN 0001 and CLIN 0004.

The NAICS codes applicable to this requirement is 236220-Commercial and Institutional Building Construction (small business size standard-$33.5 million).

Your attention is directed to Sections L and M of SIR/RFO DTFAAC-14-R-02916 for instructions for preparation and submission of proposals.  The SIR includes a technical evaluation process that will comprise of multiple evaluation factors; i.e., past performance and organizational experience, and key personnel.  Offerors are required to provide Past Performance Surveys to customers/contractors who are familiar with the work ethic, standards, performance, and deliverables demonstrated through previous or ongoing contracts of a similar nature  [Provision L.1 (f)(1).]  Offerors will complete pages 2 and 3 of the Past Performance Surveys and then provide the surveys to their customers, who will in turn complete and return the surveys directly to the Contracting Officer by the due date specified on the surveys.  Past Performance Surveys must be submitted directly to the Contracting Officer.  Surveys received after the established due date may not be evaluated.

Offerors will submit a price proposal for a Sample Project to be utilized in determining cost realism.  [See Section L, Provision L.1(d)(4).]

ALL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE SOLICITATION OR SAMPLE PROJECT MUST BE RECEIVED IN WRITING (CONNIE.M.HOUPT@FAA.GOV) NO LATER THAN 4:00 P.M. CST ON MARCH 18, 2014, TO ALLOW FOR RESPONSES TO BE PROVIDED PRIOR TO DUE DATE FOR RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS.

In accordance with AMS Clause 3.2.2.3-41, incorporated in the SIR/contract, prime contractors must perform, using their own organization, work equivalent to at least 15% of the total amount of work under the contract (task orders) on site.  All contractors are responsible for any necessary licenses and permits, and comply with any Federal, state, and municipal laws, codes, and regulations applicable to the work, at no additional expense to FAA.

Contractors must be registered with the System for Award Management, www.sam.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (August 22, 2013).  Reference AMS Clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), if the offeror does not become registered in the SAM database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.

In addition, offerors must complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.  8(a) companies shall provide a copy of their Oklahoma SBA 8(a) certification letter, as evidence of eligibility.

Proposals must be received by the FAA, Bid and Proposal Officer (AMQ-100), 6500 S. MacArthur Boulevard, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73169, no later than 2:00 p.m. CST, March 26, 2014.  Hand-carried proposals (or proposals sent by overnight delivery) shall be delivered to Room 313 of the Multi-Purpose Building located at 6500 S. MacArthur Boulevard, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73169.  Proposals must be sealed and labeled as follows:  SIR/RFO No. DTFAAC-14-R-02916; due 2:00 p.m. CST, March 26, 2014.  

AS MULTIPLE COPIES OF THE TECHNICAL PROPOSAL ARE REQUIRED, ELECTRONIC PROPOSALS ARE NOT AUTHORIZED.  HOWEVER, A SOFT COPY OF THE COMPLETE PROPOSAL IS REQUIRED TO BE SUBMITTED WITH EACH PROPOSAL.  [SECTION L, PROVISION L.1(b) and L.1(c)(3).]

All submittals will need to allow sufficient time to process through security procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.  

Any responses received after 2:00 p.m. CST, March 26, 2014, may not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals, incorporated by reference in the solicitation.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.

As the FAA does not utilize sealed bidding contracting techniques, a public bid opening will not be held.

Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one or more offerors at any time during the SIR process.

This SIR/RFO is not to be construed as a contract or a commitment of any kind.  The Government shall not be liable for payment of any costs attributed to the preparation and submission of proposals.

Inquiries regarding this SIR/RFO should be directed to the Contracting Officer, Connie Houpt, connie.m.houpt@faa.gov.

These services will be required for commercial, industrial, and utility type of facilities located at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center.  Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, and equipment required for all work as described in the applicable contract documents.

Multiple contract awards are contemplated.  Each contract will be for a 1-year base period, with three 1-year option periods to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.  Task orders will be placed against the contracts to fund construction projects throughout the year.  

Requirements under these contracts can range from $1,000-$750,000 each.  It is estimated that $8.5 million in task orders will be issued under the mechanical construction multiple award contracts over four years.  

Request for proposals and award of task orders will be specific to projects in excess of $50,000 [Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 0001] and less than $50,000 [CLIN 0004].  

Requests for proposals for projects estimated to be greater than $50,000 will be issued to all mechanical construction contract holders and will be accompanied by detailed specifications and construction drawings. [SIR/RFO, Section G, Clause G.1]  

As customers often require projects to be completed in an expedited manner, site visits may be scheduled within 5 days (or less) of issuance of Task Order Request for Proposals (TORFP).  Contractors must be able to respond to requests for meetings, site visits, TORFPs, task order mobilization, etc. with very little notice.  Typical response time for task order proposals is 15 days.  Regular meetings between contractors and the FAA will be scheduled at the post-award conference for each Task Order.

Expedited competitive procedures; e.g., rapid turn-around times (TAT)/completion dates, generally under 15 days, will be utilized for projects estimated to be less than $50,000.  In addition, it is anticipated that projects estimated to be less than $10,000 could be awarded by a designated Ordering Official on a more informal basis.  Approximately 150 work orders were issued at the MMAC in 2013 for general, electrical and mechanical construction projects under $50,000 each, for an estimated total of $400,000 for the year.

The Government reserves the right to solicit proposals for requirements below the $50,000.00 threshold under CLIN 0001 and requirements above the $50,000 threshold under CLIN 0004, if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government

Contractors will be allowed to submit proposals for both CLINs 0001 and 0004 (both less than and greater than $50,000), or only CLIN 0004 (less than $50,000).  [Contractors may not submit a proposal for only CLIN 0001.]  Contractors can receive a contract for both CLINs, for CLIN 0001 only, for CLIN 0004 only or none at all.  The FAA reserves the right to limit the number of awards to those that represent the best value to the Government.  However, it should be noted that a sufficient number of awards shall be made to ensure that at least two (2) of the technically qualified offerors have proposed on both CLIN 0001 and CLIN 0004.

The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 238220-Plumbing, Heating and Air-Conditioning Contractors, small business size standard, $14 million.

Your attention is directed to Sections L and M of SIR/RFO DTFAAC-14-R-02915 for instructions for preparation and submission of proposals.

<p>The Government will use responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT Notice to make appropriate acquisition decisions.</p>
<p>The Government invites contractors with the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements to submit Capability Statements consisting of appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references anticipated to be 5 to 6 pages.<br /><br />Project Description: This project will replace the main underground medium voltage feeder cables from the local utility company's substation located at the east gate of NAS Whiting Field to the main switchgear. Project includes construction of a new medium voltage duct bank system, including manholes and concrete encased duct bank. The route of the replacement duct bank includes directional drill under existing taxiway, drainage ditches, spillway, and existing duct bank. Removal of existing medium voltage cabling will require proper handling of the existing paper insulated lead coated (PILC) cabling and proper handling for removal and disposal of asbestos containing materials. The existing duct bank will be abandoned in place after removal of the existing cables. This project will provide a new medium voltage structure (H structure) to support the new main feeder connections, expand the required grounding grid and fenced area for the replacement structures, and provide new re-closers to serve the new feeder conductors. This project will also provide a new overhead connection to the existing feeders at the new switching structure.</p>
<p>This project will remove and replace one existing main electrical switchgear lineup consisting of nineteen (19) compartments in the high bay area of a building. The new switchgear will be installed on a 6" concrete pad approximately 1,000 feet from the exterior of the facility. The pad mounted switchgear will be sized as required to accommodate the four feeders and distribution circuits. Power poles and aerial conductors will be reworked and upsized to become main lines to replace the overhead laterals to the switchgear. Electrical wiring, grounding, cross arm supports, insulators, connections and terminations, testing and commissioning will be provided. The new switchgear line-up will be standalone walk-in type switchgear. Overhead circuits will be fed directly from the new switchgear line-up via underground connections to risers and overhead extensions. The new switchgear will be installed in the new location prior to demolition of the existing switchgear to minimize any outages required. The overhead lines will be reworked to remove the existing primary connections to the circuits and provide redundant switching capabilities. Load monitoring and profile will be provided to determine the existing demand load of the three circuits (north, south, and west).</p>
<p>The government is only seeking a 2 to 6 page response. The information which must be contained in your response is as follows:</p>

The purpose of this amendment is to add the estimated total value of the procurement to the Notice of Intent to Sole Source.
******************************************************************************



Fondriest Environmental, Inc. Repair and Upgrade 5 YSI 6600-M Multiparameter Sondes

	The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)-FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) with Fondriest Environmental, Inc. to repair and upgrade five (5) YSI 6600-M Multiparameter Sondes.  
	EPA has identified Fondriest Environmental, Inc. as the only contractor able to meet the requirements of this procurement. The nature of this acquistion requires a contractor that possesses the unique capabilities of completing repairs and modifications specific to YSI 6600-M Multiparameter sondes.  YSI Incorporated is the sole manufacturer of 6600, but Fondriest Environmental is the only authorized distributor, located in (Fairborn) Ohio, that also covers Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, West Virginia and Western Pennsylvania to sell, service and upgrade this specialized piece of equipment.  These unique capabilities are essential for contract performance because sondes play a vital role in data collection for green infrastructure (GI).  The Sustainable Technology Division (STD) is conducting research to provide ongoing assessment of water quality conditions and evaluate changes associated with the implementation of sustainable watershed management under the R7 RARE funding and  SSWR4.1 A, 4.2.  No other contractor has or can obtain these capabilities because a market survey revealed that no other company is authorized to make repairs or upgrades to this equipment.  
	The contractor shall repair and upgrade five (5) YSI 6600-M Multiparameter sondes (serial numbers 05H1029AA; 02G0979AC; 02G0979AB; 02G0979AA; 03G0578AA) with disolved oxygen, turbidity and rhodamine sensor upgrades, bulkhead replacement and various other repairs including conductivity and temperature sensors.  In addition, consumable items are also being purchased so minor repairs and maintenance can be conducted in the field when needed.  (The value of the consumables is less than $500.)  The total estimated value of the procurement is $48,000. 	Any firm that is capable of meeting EPA?s requirement as set forth above may submit a response; which, if received within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be reviewed for consideration.  Responses to this posting must be submitted in writing via email only.  A determination not to compete the described requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Any responses or comments should be directed via email to Kimberly Loesch at loesch.kimberly@epa.gov.  One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to Free Trade Agreements.  EPA anticipates that award will be made by March 31, 2014.
