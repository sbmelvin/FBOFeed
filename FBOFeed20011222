 harrison@plk.af.mil.  Information concerning this procurement will be available on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) http://www.eps.gov.  The AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide,
Dated 29 Jun 98, is available at http://extra.afrl.sf.mil/policy-guides.htm.  The total program budget for this effort is approximately $7.85M over a five-year period.

A-INTRODUCTION:  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy
Directorate (DE), Kirtland AFB, NM is seeking innovative techniques and approaches to AFRL research requirements for the Directed Energy Effects Research Branch (DEPE).  The goal of this effort is to develop innovative approaches for determining the susceptibility/vulnerability of U.S. and foreign systems to high-power microwave (HPM) environments.  These new approaches would result in improvements in accuracy and efficiency over currently used techniques.  The innovative approaches being sought would be applicable to experimental planning and procedures, pre- and post-experiment analysis and the area of modeling and simulation.  Development and maintenance of a unique database management system for the compilation/cataloging of HPM -induced
Effects on systems, subsystems and components are desired.  The metric of success will be based on the improvements in capability and accuracy that can be obtained and the capability to obtain useful information with the expenditure of fewer resources.

The successful offeror(s) will address the desired improvements to accuracy and efficiency of experimental procedures, the development of an effective database management system for storing and accessing the data generated by HPM effects experiments, and the feasibility of hardening military systems to HPM effects.  The successful offeror(s) will exhibit one or more of the following strengths:  demonstrate extensive knowledge of HPM technology related to the (AFRL/DEPE) research areas; propose innovative methods which improve the understanding of the phenomenology of HPM vulnerability research; possess a unique capability which aids AFRL/DEPE in developing a better understanding of the phenomenology of HPM vulnerability research; demonstrate innovative methods which lead to scientific advancement and breakthroughs in understanding HPM effects and physics principles; and/or demonstrate novel methods which may improve the quality of analysis and the accuracy of prediction techniques.

AFRL contemplates award of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) completion contract(s) under this announcement, but may award other types of contracts or non-FAR instruments as appropriate.  The government may make one, several, or no awards and may incorporate any one or more parts, or all, of the above-described requirements in an individual contract.  Therefore, all interested firms are encouraged to participate in this action, even if not capable of satisfying all of the government's mission needs.  Submit an offer on that part or parts of the work that you do well.  A statement of objective (SOO), which further outlines four distinct task areas, and examples of related work are provided on the EPS website.  While no pre-proposal conference is contemplated for this effort, prospective offerors wishing to visit AFRL facilities listed in the supplemental information package posted on the EPS may do so by contacting the technical POC cited above and arranging a visit.  All visits will be escorted.  Only questions directly related to the facilities will be answered.  All o

Information concerning this procurement will be available on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) http://www.eps.gov.  The AFRL PRDA/BAA Guide, dated 29 Jun 98, is available at http://extra.afrl.af.mil/policy-guides.htm.
The total program budget for this effort is approximately $7.85M over a five-year period.

A-INTRODUCTION:  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy Directorate (DE), Kirtland AFB, NM is seeking innovative techniques and approaches to AFRL research requirements for Directed Energy Effects Research.  The goal of this effort is to develop innovative approaches for determining the susceptibility/vulnerability of U.S. and foreign systems to high-power microwave (HPM) environments.  These new approaches would result in improvements over currently used techniques and approaches.  The innovative approaches being sought would be applicable to experimental planning and conduct, pre- and post-experiment analysis, and lethality assessments. The metric for a successful white paper will be based on innovative improvements proposed over current techniques and approaches that can obtain useful information with the expenditure of fewer resources. The successful offeror (s) will address one or more of the task areas described in the SOO. The successful offeror (s) will demonstrate extensive knowledge and innovative methods that lead to scientific advancement and breakthroughs in understanding HPM effects and physics principles.  The successful offeror(s) will also demonstrate novel methods that improve prediction techniques. 
AFRL contemplates award of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) completion contract(s) under this announcement, but reserves the right to award other types of contracts or non-FAR instruments as appropriate.  The government reserves the right to make one, several, or no awards and to incorporate any one or more parts, or all, of the effort in an individual contract.  Therefore, all interested firms are encouraged to participate in this action, even if not capable of satisfying the government's entire mission needs.  Offer on that part or parts of the work that you do well.  A statement of objective (SOO), which outlines four distinct task areas, and examples of related work are provided on the contracting website.  While no pre-proposal conference is contemplated for this effort, prospective offerors wishing to visit AFRL facilities listed in the supplemental information package posted on the EPS may do so by contacting the technical POC cited above and arranging a visit.  All visits will be escorted.  Only questions directly related to the facilities will be answered.  All other questions should be submitted in writing or by facsimile transmission to the contracting officer.  Answers will be posted on the website as general information to all prospective offerors.

B-PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:  Offerors shall submit a white paper focusing on innovative approaches (i.e., advancing the state of the art, increasing knowledge and understanding, new and creative solutions to problems, etc.), techniques and unique capabilities which can be applied to work described herein and in the SOO presented on the EPS website.  Offerors are advised to ensure that their white papers address all portions of each task area proposed on with special focus on strengths and new ideas rather than merely a documented record of past accomplishments.  Offerors otherwise have latitude as t
