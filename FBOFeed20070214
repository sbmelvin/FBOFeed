PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, SCOPE AND FUNDING

The mission of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office (DSO) is to identify and pursue high-risk/high- payoff research initiatives throughout a broad spectrum of the science and engineering disciplines, and to transform these initiatives into important, radically new military capabilities. To carry out this mission, DSO seeks research ideas and areas that might lead to innovations in science and engineering. Therefore, DSO is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development in a variety of enabling technical areas as described below. 

Proposals may be either basic or applied research. However, in all cases, proposers should demonstrate that their proposed effort is aimed at high-risk/high-payoff technologies that have the potential for making, in the 5-10 year timeframe, revolutionary rather than incremental improvements to national security, including emerging threats and operational challenges.  Proposals that are not within the topical areas described below may be considered out of scope and may not be evaluated (see Other Technical Areas). Likewise, proposals for the integration of existing technologies or development of systems will also be considered out of scope and will not be evaluated.  

Multiple awards are anticipated. The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds. While there is no specific requirement for cost and duration of the proposed effort, it is recommended that proposers include a Phase I of 12 to 18 months in length that addresses the most critical issues on the path to success. 

This BAA constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort. No Proposer Information Pamphlet or other additional information will be published, nor will a formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this research and development be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded.  

TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS OF INTEREST TO DSO

This section describes the general technical interests of DSO. Please note that while the topics are organized by traditional disciplines, interdisciplinary proposals are encouraged. Regardless of the technical area, the ultimate success of a proposal is based on the specific technical idea(s) advanced within these areas and especially the uniqueness of the proposed approach. Consequently, proposing within one of these topic areas is not sufficient to make a compelling case for funding. For this reason, white papers are strongly suggested before submitting a full proposal (see White Paper Submissions below).

Special Focus Areas

From time to time, DARPA will publish addenda to this BAA that will highlight particular areas of interest. It is highly recommended that potential proposers look periodically for these updates.  Addenda will have deadlines for submission of white papers and proposals that are different from the deadline in this BAA. Under addenda, the technical content for a submission as well as the overall structure of the proposed effort may also differ. DARPA will not establish a distribution list for automatic distribution of these addenda. Any specific instructions or criteria in a published addendum will take precedence over this BAA in response to that addendum only.
  
Other Technical Areas

Ideas outside of the advertised focus areas will be considered in scope only if the proposers can demonstrate that they have the potential for radical improvement to national security and are within the technical interests of the office. Proposals that integrate existing technologies or products into systems generally do not fall within the purview of DSO and are likely to be rejected.  

WHITE PAPER SUBMISSIONS

Before proposers put together a full proposal, it is highly recommended (though not required) that they submit a white paper in response to the BAA. This white paper should clearly state the uniqueness of the idea presented in the context of existing state of the art in the technical area of interest. Demonstrating that the proposer has a clear understanding of the state of the art and that their proposed effort will make significant improvements therein is essential for a successful proposal. The white paper should also describe the proposed approach and explain why it is unique. Further, the proposer should demonstrate an understanding of the payoff of the technical idea, especially in terms of how it might make a difference to Defense capabilities. Key milestones expected in the effort should be described. Also, a brief discussion of the technical expertise of the proposed principal investigator and other key team members should be provided.  Finally, an estimate of the program costs and duration (in months) should be included. White papers should not be longer than 8 pages; however, shorter white papers that can cover the content above are strongly encouraged.

A website http://www.sainc.com/dsobaa has been set up to facilitate the submission of white papers. This site will allow proposers to fill in contact information and upload a white paper document in either Word or PDF format. It will provide a method by which proposers can track their submissions. White paper submissions may also be made by attachment to an e-mail sent to BAA07-21@darpa.mil (Word 97 or higher is recommended). Embedded text and Postscript are also acceptable. Note: If the website is not used, then the body of the e-mail and the attachment must include name, mailing address, phone number, and fax number of the proposer. If this information is not contained in the body, the e-mail will be returned for inclusion of that information. (If proposers choose not to use e-mail, U.S. mail may be used. White papers and proposals will not be accepted by way of facsimile transmissions.) Within two weeks of receipt of the white paper, the proposer will receive a confirmation providing a log number and both a technical and administrative point of contact. The formal recommendation about whether a full proposal is recommended will be made as soon as possible. However, the exact time for response will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the number of white papers received. Procedures have been put in place that will help proposers to rapidly determine the applicability of their white paper to DARPA/DSO and to help develop promising ideas into formal proposals with a reasonably high probability of funding. Proposers may recommend a program manager to review their proposals based on prior discussions and/or information on the DSO website. Please note, this recommendation and any additional feedback provided is for the benefit of the proposer and following these recommendations is not a guarantee that the full proposal will be funded. All full proposal submissions will be evaluated regardless of the disposition of the white paper.

<DESC>RFI for Enhanced Content Technologies to support 
GPOs Digital Content System (FDsys)

Contracting Office Address:
U.S. Government Printing Office, Acquisitions Services Division, 732 North Capitol Street, NW 
Room A332, Washington, DC, 20401
Description:
This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for market research, budgetary and planning purposes only!    
 
The United States Government Printing Office (GPO) is developing a system (FDsys) to allow government content to be created, managed, authenticated, versioned and subsequently preserved in perpetuity. 

FDsys will ingest, preserve, and provide access to the information produced by all three branches of the U.S. Government. The proposed system is envisioned as a comprehensive, systematic, and dynamic means for preserving any type of digital content, independent of specific hardware and/or software. The system will enable GPO customers to obtain hard copy publications and to electronically access the content they want, and it will enable GPO to deliver that content in the formats its customer?s desire. The system is intended to automate many of the content lifecycle processes and make it easier to deliver the content in formats suited to the needs of GPO customers. 

GPO is requesting information from industry specific to the enhanced content functionality described in FDsys documentation (e.g., concept, requirements and release documentation). This information will be used assess the current state of available enhanced content technology (ECT), and may be used to revise FDsys documentation and plans in order to deliver key content functionality in FDsys.

Background:
GPO is the Federal government?s primary centralized resource for gathering, cataloging, producing, providing, and preserving published U.S. Government information in all its forms.  Since its inception, under the authority of Title 44 of the U.S. Code, GPO has offered Congress, the courts, and government agencies a set of centralized services that enables them too easily and cost effectively produce printed documents.  GPO has offered these publications for sale to the public and made them widely available for no fee public access through the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). The FDLP has also served the purpose of providing permanent public access to government publications.  
Content in FDsys will include all known Federal Government documents, but is specifically targeted to those within the scope of GPO?s Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP), whether printed or born digital. This content will be entered into the system and then authenticated and catalogued according to GPO metadata and document creation standards. Content may include text and associated graphics, video and sound and other forms of content that emerge. Content will be available for Web searching and Internet viewing, downloading and printing, and as document masters for conventional and on-demand printing, or other dissemination methods. An internal pilot of FDsys will be available in summer 2007 and the first public release will be delivered at the end of 2007. 
The FDsys will count among its user classes over 5,000 content creation users working in all branches of the government and congress, over 500 Government service specialists, over 25,000 private sector service providers, 1300 depository libraries, 50 end user information providers, and the citizenry of the United States and the world as the ultimate end users.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Title of Project:  Methods Consultation for the Medical Monitoring Project

Background and Need ? Center?s for Disease Control and Preventions has been provided technical assistance in the development of a sampling plan that derives a national, population-based estimate of persons in care for HIV infection (the Medical Monitoring Project), as well as a national sampling that resulted in the selection of the 26 eligible grantees for the Medical Montoring Project (MMP).  The project?s multistage cluster sampling design is complicated, and the field is a very specialized one.  The contractor will work closely with CDC?s MMP staff to select facility and patient samples.  The contract will also develop algorithms for individual facilities within each project area that will be conducting real time sampling.  In addition, as CDC approaches another 4 year funding cycle, the contractor will be required to assist CDC in determining whether to re-fresh the sample of states that will be eligible to participate in MMP or redraw a new sample and the implications of the impact on the project.    CDC must consult with researchers who have successfully implemented these methods.  In particular, CDC seeks to continue to involve experts who have designed and conducted a national multistage probability sample of persons in care for HIV infection and who therefore are uniquely qualified to provide technical assistance with the implementation of the sampling on a national and local (i.e., eligible grantees) level, and to provide ongoing input into operational issues. Project Objective ? The purpose of this project is to (1) continue to obtain technical advice and information on statistical methods and analyses, weighting issues, ongoing sampling methods, and operational issues during the conduct of and analysis of data from the national, population-based Medical Monitoring Project (previous contract (252000005) awarded under task order HHSP2332004000015T); (2) assist selected project areas in the acquisition and selection of a random sample of HIV care providers, and a random sample of their patients, for the continuation of the national, population-based Medical Monitoring Project; (3) assist CDC with the weighting of data from individual project areas and for the national data set; and (4) assist CDC with the selection or modification of the existing sample of states for participation in the project in the next cooperative agreement cycle. Scope of Work ? Working with the Task Order Officer and other individuals assigned to the program, the Contractor shall perform the following tasks under this task order: (1) perform random sampling of HIV care providers and their patients; (2) provide to CDC ongoing expert technical advice for the Medical Monitoring Project; (3) meet with CDC staff to discuss the statistical and operational issues relating to the Medical Monitoring Project; (4) weight the data from individual project areas and for the national data set; and (5) draw a modified or new sample of states for inclusion in the Medical Monitoring Project?s next 4 year cycle.  The period of performance Task 1-8: 12 months from day of contract award Task 1-8: Starts 12 months from day of contract award and end 24 months after contract award. Technical Requirements: Task 1.	Meet with CDC Project Officer after the contract is awarded to discuss the continuation of drawing facility and patient samples, and to continue discussions regarding drawing a new sample of states for the next four year cooperative agreement cycle.  Task 2.  Provide to CDC ongoing expert technical advice and information regarding statistical considerations, weighting, and operational aspects of the Medical Monitoring Project.  This includes: facility sampling; geographic stratification of facilities; facility linkages; patient sampling; the need to re-draw facility samples each year; reconciling the differences between estimated patient loads and patient loads obtained from providers during the population definition period; and the creation and application of  algorithms for individual facilities within each project area conducting real-time sampling; and deadlines for facility recruitment, facility and patient sampling and completing data collection during each project cycle.  Provide written documentation of recommendations and decisions within 30 days of discussion.  Task 3.  Review materials and concepts developed by CDC, providing critical comment and advice.  This includes: project protocols; protocols for real time sampling; analysis proposals; programs to select facility and patient samples; facility attributes to be collected; the development of telephone and self-administered surveys and the combination of this data with data collected from face-to-face interviews; provider recruitment tools and techniques; and the determination of surveillance period start and end dates for patients who cannot be found or who died during the surveillance period.  Provide written documentation summarizing the critical comments and advice within 30 days of review.  Task 4.	Working with data from all eligible grantees, and in collaboration with CDC, perform random sampling of HIV care providers and their patients, using methods agreed upon in collaboration with CDC and grantees within 2 weeks after receipt of data from individual grantees.  Document the sampling process for facility and patient samples for each project area within 30 days of drawing the sample.  Task 5.	Provide the list of sampled providers and patients to CDC for distribution to grantees within 3 weeks after receipt of data from individual grantees.  Task 6.	Meet quarterly with CDC Project Officer at a location to be determined by CDC for 2 days to discuss the statistical and operational issues relating to it for the Medical Monitoring Project.  These discussions will include: drawing a completely new sample of states for the next four year cooperative agreement cycle vs. replacing only a portion of the states and how a partial draw would be done; the need to re-draw facility samples each year; reconciling the differences between estimated patient loads and patient loads obtained from providers during the population definition period; current publications and priority publications for the next data collection cycle; real time sampling; the use of abstraction-only and minimal data in the absence of interview; changing or maintaining the length of the population definition period; inclusion of patients from jails and other institutions where sampled patients may be difficult to find; and alternative methods of collecting information from the patient other than face-to-face interviews.   Task 6.1. Develop a written summary of major points of discussion and emerging recommendations from each meeting, within 30 days after the meeting.  Task 6.2. Develop manuscripts for publication in peer reviewed journals addressing the statistical and operational issues discussed in the consultations and in other communications with CDC.  Task. 7.  Work in collaboration with CDC, analyze/weight the data from individual project areas and for the national data set.  Task  8.  Select a new or modified sample of states for participation in the Medical Monitoring Project?s next cooperative agreement cycle. Deliverables ?

<DESC>TRANSPORTABLE MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING SYSTEM BAA 07-21 Addendum 1 
DUE: May 15, 2007. 
TECHNICAL POC: Dr. John R. Lowell, DARPA/DSO 
Ph: (571) 218-4685 
Email: baa07-21@darpa.mil
URL: www.darpa.mil/dso/solicitations/solicit.htm; Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0721/

DESCRIPTION
(Note: This BAA Addendum 1 is submitted as a Special Focus Area as described in the original BAA, 07-21.)

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking innovative proposals for the development of a transportable Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) system capable of field deployment to in-theater Combat Support Hospitals (CSHs) for diagnosis and assessment of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) to front-line soldiers, sailors, and airmen. Proposals are suggested for research programs that demonstrate technology development and integration into an MRI system that weighs less than 800 pounds and has a footprint of less than 10 square feet; the system should have a field of view 25 cm x 25 cm x 25 cm with 1.5 mm x 1.5 mm x 1.5 mm voxel dimensions (hereafter 1.5 mm cubic voxel) that effectively produces 2D axial images in 45 seconds (per 1.5 mm slice) or less.

It is expected that each research effort will consist of an interdisciplinary team with the skills needed to address all of the relevant research challenges necessary to meet the program goals. These research areas include (but are not limited to): 1) Novel lightweight magnet designs that maximize field strength and homogeneity while simultaneously minimizing stray fields and magnet weight; 2) High performance radio-frequency multi-element receiver designs; 3) Techniques to reliably compensate for magnetic field inhomogeneities and/or non-linear field gradients, including the use of tailored pulse sequences and/or magnet-specific hardware to spatially compensate for static field coil inhomogeneities; 4) Novel ultra-high sensitivity (and/or low-frequency) receivers that allow operation in lower magnetic field regimes; 5) Techniques to miniaturize signal acquisition, distribution, and processing hardware, including low-noise amplifiers and analog-to-digital (A/D) converters, novel (including optical) data transfer techniques, and miniature connector designs; and 6) Disciplined system engineering to enable use by untrained personnel in harsh operating conditions, including reduced outward system complexity without sacrificing overall reliability, techniques for site placement, self-calibration, and software design that minimizes the number of operator actions for the most commonly performed tasks.

BACKGROUND

Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBIs) are one of the most devastating injuries in the battlefield, accounting for 15-25 percent of battlefield injuries since WWII [Bellamy and Zajtchuk (1991) 'The Management of Ballistic Wounds of Soft Tissue' in: Textbook of Military Medicine (R. Zajtuchuk, ed.), Washington, D.C.; Office of the Surgeon General, pp 163-220]. At the same time, over 50 percent of all moderate-severe TBIs from Desert Storm resulted in death. One of the few established techniques for early diagnosis and assessment of TBIs is to perform screening with a MRI system. This is especially true for mild to moderate TBI, which invariably present as normal on CT scanners, the only tool available at the Combat Support Hospitals (CSHs).  

Early diagnosis of TBIs is critical for successful treatment, especially since TBIs can go unnoticed for days; current standards of soldier care typically result in extra-theater patient transfer during this period. While patients with TBIs are able to be transported, special care must be taken to avoid placing patients at increased risk; clear diagnosis and assessment of TBI before inter-theater transport is therefore medically prudent. Placing an MRI in the CSH will therefore have an immediate impact on front-line readiness, inter-theater logistics burden, and the long-term outlook of injured soldiers, as early TBI diagnosis means significantly higher probability that soldiers will regain normal quality of life.

Combat Surgical Hospitals do not have MRI systems; their extreme weight (greater than 10 tons), large size (greater than 300 sq ft of floor space), and significant infrastructure burdens (cryogen supply for superconducting magnets, concrete shielded room devoid of metal, etc.) make them nearly impossible to field in the demanding environment of a CSH, which can range from a converted hospital to an office building to a tent.

Commercial MRI system development stresses the production of large external magnetic fields using superconducting magnets to increase spin polarization within the imaging volume. These magnets are designed to increasingly demanding field homogeneity specifications, and with the addition of linear field gradients, allow received signals spread over a range of frequencies to be de-correlated and reconstructed into a spatial distribution of spin populations that form the basic elements of the produced image. Recent research activities [c.f. Perlo, et al., Science 308, 1279 (2005); McDermott et al., PNAS 101, 7857 (2004); Mair et al., Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 53, 745 (2005); and Bouchard, Phys. Rev. B, 74, 054103 (2006)] have pointed to a suite of technologies that collectively appear to offer the distinct possibility of producing an MRI system significantly smaller and lighter than current commercially available systems. In general, these research activities have addressed either production of high quality images in significantly reduced field regimes (at the extreme, this includes earth-field imaging using superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) or atomic magnetometers) or the production of images in static magnetic fields with significantly increased inhomogeneity. When viewed alongside other technical advances made in such diverse fields such as quantum information science, near-field RF antenna design, and efficient signal processing, the research activities above indicate that a concerted effort should be made to design a transportable MRI system to meet the compelling needs of injured soldiers.

PROGRAM GOALS AND MILESTONES

The goal of this Program is to develop an MRI system that weighs less than 800 pounds and has a footprint of less than 10 square feet; the system should have a field of view 25 cm x 25 cm x 25 cm, volumetric and planar image acquisition capability with 1.5 mm cubic voxels, and acquisition times on the order of 45 seconds per slice.

The Transportable MRI Program will be separated into two phases. The Phase I goal is to demonstrate the highest risk elements necessary to meet the end of program goals. The Phase II program goals are to develop, demonstrate, and thoroughly test an MRI system capable of meeting all of the stated performance criteria (system weight, image volume, image resolution, image acquisition time, and structure delineation). Note that proposed technologies and experimental design should incorporate all relevant National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) standards for evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging systems (and FDA regulatory approval of medical devices).

Phase I will be a research effort of not more than 24 months. 

Phase I program goals are:

1.	Demonstrate the operation of a Phase I Magnetic Resonance Imaging system. The Phase I system should have a minimum imaging volume of 15,625 cm3 (a cube with each side 25 cm) and a maximum system weight of 2000 lbs (909 kg). Using the Phase I system, the performer must demonstrate in a constructed phantom, that they can achieve the end-of-program performance goals in at least one of the three areas listed below (a, b, or c) without exceeding the minimum (maximum) acceptable performance in the other areas:
a.	Linear pixel dimension for 2D axial image (Goal: less than 1.5 mm; Maximum: 1 cm)
b.	Effective 2D axial image acquisition time (Goal: less than 45 sec; Maximum: 200 sec)
c.	Image structure delineation (Goal: less than 10 percent proton density difference; Maximum: 35 percent proton density difference). Acquired images should enable clear delineation of adjacent structures in an imaging phantom with proton density differences analogous to structures found within neuroradiological images (white matter, grey matter, CSF, etc)
 
2.	Perform experiments that provide evidence that the areas left for performance demonstration in Phase II will scale from their Phase I values to the Phase II goals. These experiments need not be performed on the Phase I experimental apparatus, although that is preferred, provided the same technical approaches are utilized in any experimental apparatus utilized. 
 
3.	Produce a design of a Phase II MRI system, a work plan to develop it (experimental plan, technical gap analysis), and show how the experiments proposed in Phase II are poised to achieve the Phase II milestones.  

Phase II is expected to be a research effort of between 24 and 36 months. The Phase II program goals are to develop, demonstrate, and thoroughly test an MRI system capable of meeting all of the following performance criteria:

1.	System weight less than 800 pounds (364 kg)

2.	Imaging volume: greater than 15,625 cm3 (25 cm cube)

3.	Linear image resolution for 2D axial image: less than 1.5 mm

4.	Effective 2D axial image acquisition time: less than 45 sec

5.	Image structure delineation: less than 10 percent proton density difference for adjacent structures.

To the extent possible, experiments should be conducted to demonstrate the ability of the developed Phase I or Phase II MRI systems for non-invasive, non-structural or functional imaging of the brain (i.e., functional MRI, or fMRI; Magnetic Resonance Angiography, or MRA; Magnetoencephalography, or MEG; and similar techniques) with identical or minimally-modified hardware.

Phase II deliverables must include a summary report of experimental data which demonstrates that each of the five performance criteria have been achieved. Additionally, consideration should be given to the completeness of the experimental plan to enable submission of an application for device classification and Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with the FDA upon completion of Phase II. Please see http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/ for information of the FDA regulatory requirements for diagnostic medical devices.

<DESC>************ PLEASE NOTE:  This is a modification to Space Warfare Center (SWC) Open Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 04-01.  Call SWC BAA 04-05 makes minor changes to existing focus areas under TENCAP and the Fusion Center and eliminates all of the focus areas under the Battlelab.  Other clerical changes have also been made as a result of this modification.  Calls may be issued for a period of no more than five years from the date of its initial announcement and will be executed on an annual basis.  White papers for SWC BAA 04-05 may be submitted from the date of this announcement through 19 Feb 08.  All terms and conditions of the previous announcement for SWC BAA 04-04 remain valid.  A complete description of SWC BAA 04-05 is identified in the attached document.  The SWC may contract for activities covered in the focus areas detailed within this document.  The intent of the BAA is to investigate and develop concepts and technologies that will enable the SIDC to meet current and future Air Force warfighter space needs.  The goal is to develop technologies that provide the best possible space capabilities for the warfighters, when and where needed, in the most cost-effective manner,.  White papers and subsequent proposals can cover either development of new capabilities for potential 3600 R&D acquisitions or leverage off of existing capabilities for 3400 O&M acquisitions.  Please closely follow the directions in the BAA regarding submission of white papers and do not submit a formal proposal at this time.  After market research was performed, it was determined that specific funds would not be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  However, should potential white papers be accepted from those institutions, and adequate funding become available, proposals will be requested from them.  Direct questions to Mr. Robert Wind at (719) 567-3565 (robert.wind@schriever.af.mil).

<DESC>MSHA is seeking vendors that can provide an interactive mine ventilation model to be utilized as a hands-on, visual training aid for miners with all levels and experience.  The model shall have the ability to be configured with stoppings, seals, air locks, doors, overcasts and undercasts to create many different air flow patterns.   The model shall contain interchangeable portions and sections that will enable the instructors or the students to create a number of scenarios showing the results and effects of the ventilation system in a mine.  The model shall allow for and describe both supply and return air systems through the mine.  The fan units will have the ability to work tandem or independently from each other and shall incorporate the ability to allow for the various fans to have adjustable speed control.  
 
The dimension of the model will be roughly 34? wide by 60? long (about the size of a normal desktop).  The height of the model will be 3? from top to bottom with a removable top.
 
 
 
Specifications
Ventilation Model
 
PART 1 - GENERAL
1.01 SUMMARY OF WORK
Provide a custom mine ventilation model that will be built as a hands-on, visual training aid for miners with all levels and experience. The contractor will use a concept for design similar to that employed and utilized as in the custom models created for display at the Sago Mine public hearings, but on an expanded level. This interactive training tool will have the ability to be configured with stoppings, seals, air locks, doors, overcasts, and undercasts by the students and the instructor alike to create many different air flow patterns.  This model will be able to determinate what will be called ?cause and effect results? of the actions taken inside a mine that concern portions or all aspects of a mine ventilation system.  Since air flow is usually not seen, this will give the students the unique opportunity to see the immediate results of their action or inactions in a mine mock-up setting.  The model will contain custom interchangeable portions and sections that will enable the instructors or the students to create an almost endless variety of scenarios showing the results and effects of the ventilation system in a mine.  Systems designed into this exclusive training mechanism will allow for the model to have both supply and return air systems through the mine.  The fan units will have the ability to work tandem or independently from each other. Additionally, the system design will incorporate the ability to allow for the various fans to have adjustable speed control.  The students will have an opportunity to view a system-wide ventilation failure because of possibly error on the student?s actions.  All of this gives the beginner or the seasoned veteran the change and capability to see just what can happen in a mine in relationship to the ventilation system without the danger of actually being underground in a mine.
 
PART 2 - PRODUCTS
The dimension of the model will be roughly 34? wide by 60? long (about the size of a normal desktop).  These measurements are rough estimations since all the inner pieces will be custom made to interlock and an inch or two in either direction may be added or subtracted.  This will make all the different pieces be conventional and will uniformly fit at the same time, enabling them to be interchangeable and providing flexibility to the training aid.  The height of the model will be 3? from top to bottom with a removable top.
 
Responses and proposals with a firm fixed price are due by 3:00 p.m. February 20, 2007. 
This is an combined Solicitation/Synopsis and the only notice you will receive, only e-mail(electronic) or faxed responses will be accepted.  Please e-mail to hampton.katheryn@dol.gov or fax to 304-256-3332.

A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited

Intended use: all hallways in the Main Building, 200 Third Street.

This product is unique in design. It can be laid in any direction: everything facing the same way or every other tile facing a different direction. There is no need to match. This characteristic is important to us as the Bureau replaces tiles throughout the hallways. 

The yarn colors of this product coordinate with the existing crash rails throughout the hallways. The Bureau has several different colors of crash rails. While none of these colors are unique by themselves, it was very difficult to find a pattern and color pallet to look good with all of the colors.

This product is 90% Solution dyed and therefore will stand well against stains and color fastness.

NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.  Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than the close of business February 16, 2007 EST.  A request for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered an affirmative response.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis\solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the the format in FAR subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5 and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is HSFEMS-07-Q-0011 and is issued as a request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-09.  The North American Industry Classification System (NACIS) is 611420 (Computer Training).  The SBA size standard in millions of dollars is 6.5M.  The FEMA Biloxi TRO intends to purchase training in three different software programs as summarized below in the Performance Work Statement (PWS)
Information Technology Performance Work Statement  (PWS)
I.  BACKGROUND: 
          The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) requires IT services in maintaining and enhancing the existing and newly converted Oracle, SQL and Microsoft Applications.  In addition, FEMA requires support for those systems that have not yet been migrated into these environments, but are still in use and still need to be maintained and occasionally modified to support new management directives.  It is important that FEMA has IT staff available for problems, or should changes be required for any of these systems. These systems provide support for critical business processes within FEMA. 
To accomplish disaster activities, FEMA utilizes IT hardware (e.g., personal computers and Windows 2003 Servers) and software (e.g., Oracle, SQL, Microsoft Active Directory etc.) to perform the work.  Training is required to effectively support these new systems.
II.	PURPOSES AND SCOPE: 
The FEMA Enterprise Database Application platform is Oracle 9i/10g.  This includes Oracle Spatial for the Geospatial applications within the agency.  All field Deployable Enterprise Geospatial Suites (DEGS) are installed with Oracle Spatial 10g and ESRI ArcSDE as the middle-ware spatial data engine for Geographic Information Systems (GIS) support to Joint Field Office (JFO) operations.
One of the critical requirements to having a successful response and recovery operations in the JFO is the IT/GIS technical/administrative support.  This platform is very new to the GIS operational management and the IT support to GIS.  There is no in-house training in place to support this application system.
For this cause, we must provide the necessary training to properly equip our IT/GIS staff to successful complete their jobs.  There are also database applications that have been, and are being developed in support of recovery operations in MS Access and SQL formats. However, the Enterprise Architecture (EA) requirements call for Oracle 10g developed applications, so these databases are being redefined around Oracle.  NEMIS is an Oracle 9i suite of database modules that is being migrated to Oracle 10g with Web-based user interfaces.
SQL Server 2005 is needed because it is designed to help provide the highest level of security for enterprise data through features such as database encryption, more secure default settings, password policy enforcement, granular permissions control, and an enhanced security models.
Windows Server 2003 is the new standard operating system used by FEMA to handle a diverse set of server roles, which include: File and print services, Web server and Web application services, Mail services, Terminal server, Remote access and virtual private network (VPN) server, Directory services, Domain Name System (DNS), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, and Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS). 
Active Directory is the new FEMA Windows platform and Active Directory service provides the means to manage the identities and relationships that make up network environments. Windows Server 2003 uses Active Directory to manage migration and deployment.

As evidenced by information provided with the quote it must be apparent that the items meet all of the mandatory functional and size specifications as described in the specification document on the SPAWAR E-CC. Offerors should provide catalog cuts, drawings or any necessary documentation to include narratives covering their approach for meeting one of the functional or size specifications if not obvious without the narrative.  A narrative description of the quoter's technical approach to provide end-user frequency agility while meeting FCC spectrum requirements is specifically required.  This documentation will be used to determine compliance with mandatory specifications.  This factor is on a pass or fail basis.  Quotes that do not provide enough information to determine compliance with all of the mandatory requirements or do not meet all of the mandatory requirements will not receive further consideration. For those quotes who receive a "pass" on Factor I, the following criteria will be evaluated.  The criteria are in descending order of importance.  The intent is to award to the quoter meeting Factor I and providing the best value to the Government.  Best value will be determined by consideration of the below factors and price.  Technical factors and past performance when combined are significantly more important than price. Factor II - Ease of frequency selection:  Describe the typical steps that an end- user will have to perform to make transmit frequency changes, including any front-panel adjustments and any hardware changes required. Factor III â€“ Recent Organizational experience/past performance with Commercial Radio Band Transmitters.  Quoters should provide evidence of commercial Radio Band Transmitter experience by providing a narrative describing the number of years in this industry as well as the description of a Commercial Radio Band transmitter previously manufactured by the vendor that is most similar in function and form factor to the requested product (include photos or other descriptions).  Emphasis is placed on the transmitter's capability to allow end-users to readily change transmit frequency while maintaining FCC spectrum requirements across the band. Customer points of contact for this product are also required.  The quoters should also provide their Commercial Radio Band product line (including photos or other descriptions), citation of prior Government contracts for Commercial Radio Band transmitter products (including photos or other descriptions as well as customer points of contact to include name and phone number), Factor IV â€“ A 9 August 2007 delivery date is desired for the 10KW transmitter. Quoters should provide the best delivery date for the 10KW transmitter.  While there isn't a desired delivery date for the 2.5 KW transmitter, quoters must provide a delivery date.  For purposes of this factor, the earliest delivery date for the 10 KW transmitter will be evaluated and given the most weight.

QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES AS A RESULT OF THIS RFQ


1) The solicitation is currently due on Saturday, February 17, at 5 pm.  Is that correct?

Answer:  The solicitation has been extended to Friday, February 23, 2007 at 5:pm

2) We are required in Section C (opening) to supply "qualified personnel..." Later, under evaluation factor 2: Qualifications and Availability... We will be evaluated on our "demonstrated, documented, and relevant expertise, education, availability, and experience." Is your priority with regard to the instructors that they be professional instructors with federal experience, or that they be personnel who have hands-on FDA legal experience?"

Answer:  The award is targeted to someone who has had hands-on FDA legal experience but who has not been involved in litigation against the FDA.

3) The types of classes are a bit confusing. In one section, you say that the class duration may be five days, four days, or between 8-16 hours.  In another section, you describe two class titles:  Food Drug Law I and II.  Are we to develop both sets of classes so that they can be presented in the alternative durations, as requested?

Answer:  FDA offers courses of varying duration.  The Food Drug Law I and II are 5 day courses as described in the solicitation.  In other instances, FDA may need expertise for shorter periods of time depending on the content presented.   The Food Drug Law I and II should be presented as defined.  Since other content has not been described in the solicitation, this need is presented to inform the bidder that FDA has needs other than the two 5 day courses.

4) When you say that there are a minimum of three or a maximum of ten courses,  is this annually? This appears to be a five-year contractor, ending in September, 2012.  

Answer:  Over the duration of the contract of 5 years, FDA may need a minimum of 3 courses and a maximum of 30.  Depending on the training needs of any particular year, FDA will meet the minimum of offering a course of varying duration, 5 days, 4 days, or specified length of time.  Over the 5 year period, FDA will not go over the 30 courses.

5) And is the number of class types indicated a reference to FDL I and FDL II each, or to all classes combined? 

Answer: The number of courses will vary depending on content to be offered.  In one year, FDA may offer one five (5) day course, one four (4) day course or a course when the need may be for 8 - 16 hours.

6) For the price quote, can we confirm that you are looking for only an hourly rate for the two positions listed in section 2: Qualifications and Availability?  Since our approach will likely involve utilizing a third functional title: Instructional Design, for the staff person that will research and develop presentation materials, will we be penalized if we submit this category in addition to the two categories requested? 

Answer: FDA is seeking a qualified person to teach the courses described.  If the firm needs additional personnel, FDA is leaving it to the company to be responsible for covering the costs of any additional personnel.

The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect t hrough Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-15 and DCN 20070122.  This requirement is a 100% Small Business Set Aside with a NAICS Code of 339999 and a corresponding size standard of 500 employees.   FAR Clause 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal, is applicable.

The selection resulting from this request for quotations will be made on the basi s of the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote from a responsible quoter with acceptable or neutral past performance. Technical Acceptability is constituted by:  the items offered by the vendor are the identical items and manufacturers part numbers included in the solicitation, or the full description and specifications of the equal items the vendor is offering are equivalent to or exceed the specifications included in the solicitation, and the quoted equal items are equivalent in form, fit, and function to the items stated in the solicitation.  In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable and whether the vendor has  acceptable or neutral past performance.  If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to issue a purchase order to that vendor and no other quo te will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced quote is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not ha ve acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acc eptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Once the Contracting Officer has decided to whom an order will be issued, a unilateral order will be issued using a SF 1449.

Local clause 52.111-4131 states:    Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.  Current access information may be obtai ned by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort.  The Logistics Center Gate is open 0530  2130, Monday through Friday (closed weekends and federal holidays).  The D Street Gate Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point (CVIP) is open 0530 - 1330 Mon day through Friday (closed weekends and holidays.  In the event both the Logistics Center Gate and the D Street Gate are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate 2130  0530, 7 days a week. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  ( b)  If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except when Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta is in effect.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or  Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor  vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (Nort h Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specificall y marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor i s otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.  (End of clause). Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perf orm work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee require s access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Installation V isitor Center located near the Main (Liberty) Gate.  Contractors operating a commercial vehicle may obtain a 1-day pass at either the Logistics Center Gate or the D Street Gate when those gates are operational.  When the Logistics Center Gate and the D Str eet Gate are closed, commercial vehicles will use the Madigan Gate.  The visitors pass may be issued for a maximum of up to 30 days at a time based on sponsorship.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the cont ractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a crimin al history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a  fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the con tract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify bo th the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not  excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.   d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, s tolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identificat ion badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access t o any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.   f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.  (End of clause)  Local clause 52.111-4133 states:    Comme rcial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and the D Street Gate when those gates are operational.

A visitor pass must be obtained.  The Contractor should anti cipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  (End of clause).

<DESC>1.Amendment 0001 is hereby incorporated into Request for Quote (RFQ) number W912JF-07-T-0004 and shall become a part of any resultant contract. 2. The following is a response to contractor submitted questions: Question: The pictures we see show no corrosion protection (i.e. primer or paint).  Is this the final product we see in the pictures and does the solicitation require any corrosion treatment on the metal?  Answer: No paint or other corrosion protection required. Question: There is no drawing or any pictures showing a particular placement for the handles requested on Line Item 0001.  Is there any information to clarify this item and information to give us a size, material and placement?  The solicitation documents only give us which side of the plates to install the handles on. Answer: Attached to inside of plate to allow for moving and emplacement. Question: On Line Items 0002 and 0003, are the brackets welded to the plates?  At what dimension from the edge and bottom?  Is the 32 inch edge of the bracket welded to the plate? Answer: Up to contractor as long as plates can be fit together and connected securely. Question: On Line Item 0001, after laying out the dimensions given for the new larger front plate (as compared to the smaller unit in the pictures) the new dimensions do not give the same shape plate as the pictures.  Using 73 inch for the base of the fron t plate, 33 inch for the height of the front plate and 48 inch for the angled edge of the front plate yields an almost closed pyramid once the side plates are attached.  Are we misinterpreting the dimensions?  We would assume that the new larger Line Item 0001 is just a larger version of the smaller one in the pictures.  If so, we cannot get the listed dimensions to yield that result. Answer: Correct it will resemble the one in the picture. As far as specific measurements that will have to be done by the contractor, as long at it is large enough to fit the target mechanism and allow them to operate correctly. 3. The closing date for submission of offers will remain as February 22, 2007 at 10:00 AM CST.
