<DESC>The Government is performing market research related to contractor provided food preparation services.  In accordance with FAR Part 10 Market Research, we are requesting industry feedback on the following questions/concerns regarding commercial food preparation services.  Please note that this is not a request for proposal and is simply a request for information only.  Any costs incurred by contractors in the preparation/submission of responses to this notice will not be reimbursed.  The Government requests non-restrictive information in response to the questions below that can be considered during any potential future acquisition planning for commercially provided food preparation services.<BR> <BR>1.	Are there qualified commercial vendors who possess the current capability to provide food preparation services (cooks) on a military installation in Stuttgart, Germany?  If so, do you possess a brochure or web site that details information on your current commercial capabilities/past performance etc?  Feel free to submit electronic information that explains your companys capabilities as one aspect of market research is to assess whether a commercial capability exists to provide food preparation services in a military dining facility.<BR>2.	In the United States, the Department of Labor provides minimum wages for cooks performing in various areas of the US.  DOL minimum wage rates do not apply in overseas areas but are a valuable resource used in the preparation of Government Cost Estimates.  As contractors performing in Germany could be US or Local National (LN), is there a German Government site that provides normal expected wages earned by cooks performing food preparation in a dining facility?  If not, would companies be able to provide information on a typical wage range for cooks in Germany?  Again, please do not provide a price proposal; we are simply trying to obtain information on possible costs associated with contracted services.  <BR>3.	We have a ROUGH DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) for Dining Facility services.  Vendors are welcome to request a copy from the following: Daniel.Mengesha@eur.army.mil and are encouraged to provide constructive comments on its contents.  For example, if a paragraph states requirements that are not in-line with commercial practices, we welcome feedback stating that fact.  Another example of feedback that we are looking for, is unclear/ambiguous statements in the PWS that require elaboration/correction.  Companies are provided the opportunity to provide industry inputs and contribute to the refining of a better, more commercially aligned PWS.  <BR><BR>Thank you in advance for your time and information.  Please note that if a contract requirement materializes, it will be advertised in www.fbo.gov.  Again, there is no funding currently set aside for food preparation services and the Government is simply seeking industry feedback in support of market research to obtain information pertaining to current commercial practices and capabilities. <BR>

<DESC>The purpose of this Announcement is to advertise that we intend to add NSN 2610-01-564-6172 onto commercial Contract SPM7L107D7002.

This NSN follows under that scope. There will be no separate solicitation issued for this action. Specifications, plans, or drawings are not available.

This hardware will allow for our current capacity needs as well as for future expansion. From the onset we will be able to provide a 2GB network backbone for the servers as well as provide for a backbone upgrade to 10GB in the future without having to replace the switches. Each server will have a 1GB connection to the network. The IOS (Operating System) installed on these switches provide IPv6 switching functionality that is a Federal Agency wide requirement. The below quoted text is a section from the State Department IPv6 Transition Plan prepared by IRM/OPS/ENM/NED. 
OMB Memorandum 05-22 directs agencies to begin transitioning their network backbones to IPv6 by ensuring their network backbones are capable of processing IPv6 network addresses and passing IPv6 traffic (e.g. operating a dual stack network core, operating in a pure IPv6 mode) by June 30, 2008.  Furthermore, agency networks are required to interface with the upgraded network backbone, while maintaining continuity of operations and security before, during, and after an agency transitions to IPv6 in an operational environment. The backbone includes the WAN up to the LAN point of demarcation.  The LAN demarcation point is the device (e.g. router, switch) that services the workstations.
The document referenced above can be found here http://enm.irm.state.gov/IPv6/Trans_Plan.doc  
Purchasing the iSCSI SAN in conjunction with the CIS-WS-C3560E-48TD-E will eliminate the need to purchase additional Fibre Channel Switches that can only be used to connect the servers to the SAN (Storage Attached Network) and not for normal network switching.

PRESCRIBED BURNING THE WALLOWA-WHITMAN NATIONAL FOREST

The Forest Service is acquiring services to assist with prescribed burning to reduce the threat of catastrophic wild fire by reducing fuel loading within select natural and activity created fuels units. Work shall include prescribed burning including unit preparation and holding.  This includes furnishing all labor, supervision, transportation, operating supplies, and incidentals to perform all work necessary to conduct fire line construction and maintenance, prescribed burning, and holding.  The Contractor shall be responsible on a unit basis for all unit preparation, lighting and holding of the burning including a 48 hour period after completion of the total unit ignition. All work performed under the contract must follow guidelines, prescriptions, and objectives stated in the unit specific burn plans.  Project areas are natural and managed stands of timber of all age size, and species, shrub fields or grass areas.  Fuels will consist of natural fuels and live fuels.  Fuel loadings will range from less than 1 ton per acre to as high as 20 tons per acre.  

The work will be performed on land administered by the Wallowa Whitman National Forest. The work may take place on any of the three fire Zones of Wallowa, Burnt Powder or Grande Ronde Fire within the Wallowa Whitman National Forest.
 
The prescribed burning season on the Wallowa Whitman National Forest for under story burning is normally, between March and the early part of June for spring burning, and from the latter part of September through October for fall burning.  Major control problems can occur during a period of weather frontal passage and strong wind conditions.  Close attention to weather forecasts and securing and patrolling of previously burned units is common practice to eliminate any escaped fires.

For technical questions about this project please contact the Contracting Officers Representative, Jeff Jenkins at 541-426-5594 at the Wallowa-Mountains Office in Enterprise, OR.

an intent to procure scientific support services for the National Marine
Fisheries Service, Fish Ecology Division (FED). FED is research directed at
improving survival of Pacific salmon as they migrate to and from the ocean. The
FED requires hands-on scientific support services to meet the following objectives: 1)
assess the effects of transportation on juvenile salmonids; 2) determine the
migration timing and relative survival of salmon through reservoir and dam
passage routes; 3) determine fish guidance and orifice passage efficiencies at
selected Columbia and Snake River dams; 4) develop and evaluate alternative
fish collection and/or bypass strategies; 5) conduct juvenile and adult
radio-telemetry, acoustic and PIT-tag studies; 6) conduct estuary and river
plume studies to determine life cycle strategies; and 7) conduct oceanographic,
benthic and plankton sampling studies. FED seeks to improve the downstream
survival of migrating juvenile salmon through development and testing of
mitigation strategies and techniques such as: juvenile salmon transportation
around dams; submersible screens to divert smolts from turbine passage; and
research to better characterize in river survival of smolts and identify high
mortality areas. Other research focuses on improving passage conditions for
migrating adult salmon and lamprey. These studies are conducted largely during
the spring and summer periods when juvenile salmon migrate. Typical disciplines
and professional qualifications that will be required to support the&nbsp; work are:
fishery biologists, biology technicians, statistician, electronic technicians,
mechanics, truck drivers, vessel operators (45 feet or less), and deckhands. </span></p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source contract to Aret Associates, 333 N. Wilmot Rd., Suite 450, for a Phase III Small Business Innovative Research effort to transition operator visual aid technologies into the AQS-20 post-mission analysis (PMA) workstation.  This procurement includes an option for additional contractor support to modify the Automated Real-time Computer Aided Identification (ARCAID) Engineering Test Bed Application (ETBA) to include the operator cueing and operator visual aid capabilities.  This will be a follow on to SBIR contract number N00178-05-C-3019, which corresponds to SBIR Topic Number N03-038.  This procurement is sole source because Aret Associates is the sole developer of the ARCAID system and all internal software.  Given the complexity of the ARCAID system and the level of system knowledge required to modify the ARCAID interface description language platform, it is reasonable to assert that Aret Associates is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the required support.  Use of another company to modify the software may introduce new, or change existing parameters that may induce unacceptable error into the AN/AQS-20A system.  Therefore it is imperative that this effort is awarded to Aret Associates immediately.
The Request for Proposal (RFP) number is N61331-08-R-0046.  The NAICS code is 541330 with a small business size standard of $4,500,000.  The contract shall be firm fixed priced (FFP) with the base year period of performance being from the issuance of award until one year after date of award.  The option year period of performance, if exercised, will be for one year.  The expected award date is 25 November 2008.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001.  Delivery terms for this requirement are FOB Destination.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT, NOT AN RFQ.  NAICS:  541620  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD) intends to award a sole source fixed-price Purchase Order using FederalAcquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to the Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships, Inc. of Lexington, MA.  The purpose of this acquisition is to 1.  Convene and facilitate a steering committee with regional representation, 2. Develop materials for the Forum?s governance and operational structure, and 3. Prepare a final steering committee Forum plan in support of the Northeast Evaluation, Measurement and Verification (EM&V) Forum for Demand-Side Resources.

The forum is a critical element in advancing EPA?s goal of achieving cost-effective energy efficiency as set under its National Action Plan on Energy Efficiency.  NEEP is uniquely qualified to provide this expertise because it is the only organization working to advance best practices and approaches to EM&V on a multi-state basis and the only organization with staff expertise in EM&V methods and state-specific approaches.  This positions NEEP as the single entity capable of leveraging both resources and lessons learned from individual jurisdictions and providing them for the benefit of multiple states and the region at large.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The USGS Water Science Center, Carson City, NV. requires , upon availability of funds, twenty-five (25) each, refurbished,  Panasonic Toughbook CF-19 laptops with 3 GBytes of Ram. The refurbished Panasonic CF-19 laptops are designated by the USGS as scientific field laptops.  Environmental conditions degrade deployed household laptops at a rate fast enough to have a negative impact on mission performance.  The refurbished Toughbooks have a life cycle capability of five years which provides durability and cost savings.  Additionally, the Panasonic CF-19 is built with virtualization technology at the CPU layer (VT and Hyperthreading) which enables a longer life-cycle management capability, extending existing hardware and aged sensor hardware/software obligations into future workable states.  Each laptop must have sealed keyboards and casings designed to protect against water or other liquids, be reinforced with stronger casings to withstand being dropped, designed to protect internal components against shock and vibration, sealing and durable casing able to withstand exposure to the elements - rain, fog, snow, dust, extreme heat or cold, protection against proximity to radio or power transmission equipment to allow normal operations on the laptop.  The RFQ will be made available to interested parties through email by contacting the Contracting Officer at sevans@usgs.gov, providing mailing address, contact information, and email address not later than 30 July 2008.  All responsible sources may submit a quote.  Quotations are due by the close of business 6 August 2008.   Technical data mustl be submitted with the quote..

The proposal has major strengths and/or minor strengths. 
Weaknesses, if any, are minor and are more than offset by strengths.
Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low.
C:  A C proposal is characterized as follows:
The proposal indicates an adequate understanding of the requirement.
There are few, if any, exceptional features to benefit the requirement.
The risk of unsuccessful performance is low.
Weaknesses are generally offset by strengths.

The proposal has weaknesses that are not offset by strengths.
The risk of unsuccessful contract performance is moderate.
F:  An F proposal is characterized as follows:
The proposal indicates a lack of understanding of the requirement.

The risk of unsuccessful performance is high.
Past Performance.  The narrative description of each grade for evaluation of past performance factors and subfactors follows:
Neutral - The offeror lacks a record of relevant or available past performance history.  There is no expectation of either successful or unsuccessful performance based on the offerors past performance record.
A  The offerors performance of previously awarded relevant contract(s) met contractual requirements and exceeded many to the Governments benefit.  The assessed prior performance was accomplished with very few or very minor problems for which corrective actions taken by, or proposed to be taken by, the offeror were, or are expected to be, highly effective.  Performance of completed contracts either was consistently of the highest quality or exhibited a trend of becoming so.  The offerors past performance record leads to an extremely strong expectation of successful performance.  
B - The offerors performance of previously awarded relevant contract(s) met contractual requirements and exceeded some to the Governments benefit.  The assessed prior performance was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by, or proposed to be taken by, the offeror were, or are expected to be, effective.  Performance over completed contracts either was consistently of high quality or exhibited a trend of becoming so.  The offerors past performance record leads to a strong expectation of successful performance.  
C - The offerors performance of previously awarded relevant contract(s) met contractual requirements.  The assessed prior performance was accomplished with some problems for which corrective actions taken by, or proposed to be taken by, the contractor were, or are expected to be, for the most part effective.  Performance over completed contracts was consistently of adequate or better quality or exhibited a trend of becoming so.  The offerors past performance record leads to an expectation of successful performance.  
D - The offerors performance of previously awarded relevant contracts did not meet some contractual requirements.  The assessed prior performance reflected some serious problems for which the contractor either failed to identify or implement corrective actions in a timely manner, or for which the corrective actions implemented or proposed to be implemented were, or are expected to be, only partially effective.  Performance over completed contracts was consistently of mediocre quality or exhibited a trend of becoming so.  The offerors past performance record leads to an expectation that successful performance might be difficult to achieve or that it can occur only with increased levels of Government management and oversight.  
F - The offerors performance of previously awarded relevant contract(s) did not meet most contractual requirements and recovery did not occur with the period of performance.  The assessed prior performance reflected serious problem(s) for which the offeror either failed to identify or implement corrective actions or for which corrective actions, implemented, or proposed to be implemented, were, or are expected to be, mostly ineffective.  Performance over completed contracts was consistently of poor quality or exhibited a trend of becoming so.  The offerors past performance record leads to a strong expectation that successful performance will not be achieved or that it can occur only with greatly increased levels of Government management and oversight.

Proposal Submission Place:
Dr. Huo Taiying, Vice Director of International Cooperation Department
Shandong Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau
12 Zhi Jin Shi Street, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China

Shandong Flue Gas Denitrification (deNOx) project.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to assess the technical, economic and financial feasibility of implementing nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions control systems at coal-fired power plants throughout the province.

Shandong Province is home to over 50,000 megawatts of coal-fired power generation capacity and ranks second among all provinces in terms of coal consumption to power its plants.  While these plants have begun to implement desulfurization systems in order to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, most have not begun preparations to address NOx removal.  The Ministry of Environmental Protection of China and the Grantee have recently focused on reducing NOx emissions. The Study would focus on requirements for retrofitting one particular plant, which would be chosen after consultation with the Grantee for its applicability to serve as a model for other facilities.

Task 1: Initial Meeting / Selection of Study Plant / Project Work Plan and Schedule
Task 2: Power Plant Technical Review
Task 3: Evaluation of Alternatives
Task 4: Conceptual Design and Cost Estimate
Task 5: Economic Analysis
Task 6: Implementation and Financing Plan
Task 7: Environmental and Regulatory Review 
Task 8: Development Impact Assessment 
Task 9: Final Report and Seminar

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $600,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:

https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5:00pm, September 10, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

No public bid opening procedures are applicable to this solicitation. A firm fixed price contract is anticipated to be awarded using Best Value evaluation criteria. Anticipated award date is September 20, 2008. The performance period is expected to be 365 calendar days. North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this project is 236220.  The Small Business Size Standard is $31 Million. After solicitation issuance, contractors may view and/or download this solicitation and all amendments at the FedBizOps website. The Primary Point of Contract for this project is Ms. Lorna Craig, Contract Specialist, Lorna.Craig@va.gov.  Telephone questions will not be answered. The Government reserves the right to use only the Internet as notification of any amendments to this solicitation. It is the offerors responsibility to view the FedBizOps website daily for amendments to the solicitation.   This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures. The Government intends to use the trade-off process in selecting the prime contractor. The trade-off process is a method of evaluating both the technical factors specified in the solicitation and the price.  The object is to select the proposal that offers best value. The RFP will consist of two packages to be submitted at the same time; a technical proposal and a price proposal. The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm this will include prior performance at SORCC, Risk Analysis provided by Dun and Bradstreet, and responses from prior contracts (2) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel,  (3) Management Plan  (4) Delivery Schedule  (5) Socio-Economic considerations. Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality. Price proposal packages of offerors will then be evaluated. Technical is more important than price. Large business proposing prices in excess of $1 million shall include a subcontracting plan. Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional information, as the Government may make the final determination regarding a proposals acceptability based solely on the initial proposal submitted. The Government may proceed with the award of the contract without discussion. However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award and may discuss proposals with the offerors. If discussions are necessary, the Government will establish a competitive range.   Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation, and provides the combination of technical qualifications and price that is the most advantageous to the Government.

<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ANNOUNCEMENT; A MARKET SURVEY FOR INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF A SOLICITATION, AS ONE DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXIST.</p>
<p>NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS SYNOPSIS IS TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF POTENTIAL VENDORS.</p>
<p>1. Small business interests shall note the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and Small Business Size Standard for the requirement identified in this announcement. The anticipated NAICS code is 443120, and the size standard is $8M.</p>
<p>2. The Air Force Junior Reserved Officer Training Corps (AFJROTC) is considering purchasing 369 sets of an interactive student response system</p>
<p>3. The required characteristics for the response system items are listed below:</p>
<p>a. Must provide instantaneous feedback to instructors during summative assessments (tests) by tracking vital real-time information of students&rsquo; progression</p>
<p>b. Must allow instructors to effectively manage class time while simultaneously monitoring the progression of their students through the use of a wireless device that is part of the overall system</p>
<p>c. A graphical user interface must be provided that includes a plurality of sections, each section displaying a respective remote unit identifier for a remote unit</p>
<p>d. Must have asynchronous test administration that allows an examination to be administered through a communication system that users of a remote unit can give responses to different questions during the examination and move from question to question independently</p>
<p>e. The system must allow the instructor to view question data by categories in data slices</p>
<p>f. The system must collect and sort data so that class rosters, grading, grade/attendance reports and records, test analysis, lesson plan generation, test construction and other helpful administrative tools are available to the AFJROTC instructor</p>
<p>g. The instructor&rsquo;s device must be light weight, wireless and allow instructors to move about the classroom with the device in hand, providing input to the class via its screen stylus, laser pointer and interface with data stored on the host computer</p>
<p>h. It must also allow manually, hand-written inputs/assessment items to be transmitted to the projection screen and be tracked by the system regarding student response and accuracy, as well as use of stored exams, games, PowerPoint presentation slide files, etc. stored on the host classroom computer</p>
<p>i. The student response pads must come with a lifetime warranty and contain alphabetical keys to allow for the answering of multiple choice questions and navigation through student-managed assessments</p>
<p>j. The receiver for the response pads must connect to the host classroom computer via a USB port so it can be easily moved from classroom to classroom</p>
<p>4. JROTC is required to benchmark its curriculum to an accepted set of national standards for educational content. The government preference is to correlate curriculum content to National Educational Standards using the McREL Standards. Published state educational standards must also be incorporated into this classroom performance system database so that lesson planning can be done with the system to compare content and instruction to the host unit&rsquo;s state standards. These benchmark correlations will be included in files loaded on the system so instructors can match content, test items, presentations, etc. to the national and state standards.</p>
<p>5. The Government contemplates award of a single, firm-fixed price contract for this potential requirement.</p>
<p>6. Please submit the following information with your response to this Sources Sought Synopsis: a. Business Size: HUBZone 8(a), Other 8(a), HUBZone Small Business, Serviced Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Small Business, or Large Business b. State whether items can be obtained under an existing Government wide agency contract (i.e. GSA, VA, etc.) If so, please include contract number and contract expiration date. c. A clear indication as to whether or not your company can provide items meeting the specifications listed above, including all items in paragraphs 3 and 4.</p>
<p>7. All interested sources must respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis by 1600 hrs (4:00pm), Central Time, on 28 Jul 08. Mail responses to: 42d Contracting Squadron/LGCA-1, ATTENTION: Capt Christopher Marquis, 50 LeMay Plaza South, Building 804, Maxwell AFB, AL 36112 or email responses to: <a href="mailto:christopher.marquis@maxwell.af.mil">christopher.marquis@maxwell.af.mil</a></p>
<p>8. PLEASE NOTE: This is only a request for information conducted for the purposes of market research. It is not a request for proposals. The purpose of this synopsis is to help generate and refine requirements and identify whether enough sources exist to conduct a competitive acquisition.</p>

The recorder requested ( Yokogawa DX-1000 series ) is an exact replacement for units already installed in the Reactor Control Room. It is very undesirable to modify the "look and feel" of the recorder controls by mixing in any other brand or model of paperless data recorder.


Based on NISTs recent market research, NIST has only identified the one source that can provide the required request Yokogawa in Media, PA.

The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed- price purchase order.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotations; however, companies that believe they can fulfill the requirement may provide a written response to this notice and provide clear and unambiguous evidence to substantiate that capability. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competition.

<DESC>This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time. The purpose of this synopsis is to identify small business organizations with requisite qualifications to provide the services stated herein. Based on capability statements received in response to this Sources Sought Announcement this acquisition may be solicited as a 100% small business set-aside. All small business organizations (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) are encouraged to respond to this notice. This requirement is assigned a code of 621991 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the size standard for such requirements is $9 million. 

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)/NIH, seeks capability statements from interested and qualified potential sources to continue to provide a resource designed to receive, store, catalog, preserve, and distribute brain and tissue specimens to research investigators. The NICHD Brain and Tissue Bank was established to advance the research of developmental disabilities. 
Human autopsy and surgical tissues are retrieved from all over the United States and also from various International sites, including Canada. Over 300 disorders are represented. They include: diagnosed Downs Syndrome, other chromosomal defects, mitochondrial encephalopathies, phenylketonuria and other aminoacidopathies, maternal phenylketonuria, Rett syndrome, leukodystrophies, lysosomal disorders, unexplained forms of mental retardation, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), dyslexia, autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Specific tissues collected include the following: brain, spinal cord, cerebrospinal fluid, blood and serum, peripheral nerves, liver, kidney, pancreas, lungs, spleen, adrenal, skeletal muscles, heart, skin, thyroid, lymph nodes and gonads.

The bank serves the critical purpose of collecting, preserving, and distributing human tissues to qualified scientific investigators who are dedicated to the improved understanding, care and treatment of developmental disabilities.  NICHD anticipates that the tissue repository will periodically distribute portions of stored samples to recipients at the direction of the Government.  In addition, the Institute anticipates that other, outside groups may wish to collaborate with the Brain and Tissue Bank on separate ancillary projects related to their NICHD-funded activities.  NICHD is seeking information on the capabilities and limitations of organizations interested in providing the services described below.

6.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	Two years (extension optional) 
7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/Central Asian Republics, Dushanbe, Tajikistan 
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:

A)	Background

The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asian Republics (USAID/CAR) is a regional USAID Mission with responsibility for the development and management of the U.S. Governments assistance program for the five Central Asian Republics.  This program is directed at supporting a program of policy reform, humanitarian assistance, economic growth, democratic and social transition in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

Tajikistan poses one of the most difficult development challenges in the region.  This small isolated country was already the poorest of the republics when part of the Soviet Union, but civil war and economic collapse since independence have now reduced over 65% of the population to poverty.  While the country realized a peace dividend following the signing of peace accords in 1997, progress has otherwise been slow and reforms have stagnated.  Moreover, a difficult winter this past year left the country with severe energy shortages and strained the remaining coping strategies of the population.  Sharing a long border with Afghanistan, Tajikistan is on the front line of pressing U.S. concerns in the region: narcotics trafficking and terrorism, Islamic extremism, democratic transition, economic reform, and management of region's vast water resources.  USAID assistance to the country was initially focused on urgent humanitarian needs and supporting the peace process.  Under the new assistance strategy for Central Asia, USAID is increasingly supporting the countrys longer-term development needs, while still meeting humanitarian needs.     
USAID/CAR Tajikistan Country Office is responsible for oversight and coordination of an approximately $17 million annual assistance portfolio implemented through approximately 25 institutional contractors and international private voluntary organizations (PVOs), as well as coordinating on behalf of the U.S. Ambassador a U.S. Department of Agriculture food aid program involving three U.S. PVOs.   
     
B)  Basic Function 

Under the overall direction of the USAID/CAR Regional Mission in Almaty, Kazakhstan and the direct supervision of the Supervisory Program Officer, Tajikistan Country Office (TCO) Director, the incumbent actively participates in the conceptualization, design and overall management of USAID/CARs policy strategy/portfolio for the Missions strategic and cross-cutting objectives in Tajikistan.  The incumbent serves as the Deputy Director in USAID/CAR/Tajikistan Country Office.  In that position s/he is responsible for assisting in oversight and coordination of an approximately $17 million annual assistance portfolio implemented through six institutional contractors and 20 international private voluntary organizations (PVOs).  As a TCO Deputy Director the incumbent participates in supervision of six Foreign National Personal Services Contractor (FNPSC) employees.    
	
C)  Scope of Work

The Tajikistan Country Office Deputy Director is the alter ego of the Office Director and assumes the responsibilities and authority of the TCO Director in his/her absence.  This requires that the incumbent is fully familiar with all programs and activities, the issues and objectives involved, and the implementation partners and local counterparts.  As needed, the Country Office Director may delegate specific responsibilities or assignments to the Deputy, on either a short-term or long-term basis.  The Deputy is required to travel frequently within Tajikistan to monitor USAID activities and to travel, as well, to the USAID/CAR Regional Mission office in Almaty, Kazakhstan to consult with Mission management and technical support office staff.

Areas of responsibility for the position of Country Office Deputy Director include:

4)	Through field observation, analysis, and consultation with host government, international donor organizations and other local entities, identify needs for USAID assistance in areas consistent with the Asia Bureau and Freedom Support Act assistance program.  Advise the Tajikistan Country Office and USAID/CARs Regional Office of these needs, and as required, develop concept papers outlining the potential USAID response.  Incumbent keeps the Country Officer apprised of issues, problems, successes and solutions in the management of the country office and of USAIDs program in Tajikistan.

5)	Take the lead for the Country Office in the overall conceptualization and implementation of assigned activities within TCO portfolio and supervise local staff responsible for such activities.

6)	Assist the TCO Director to maintain effective liaison and communication between the USAID/CARs Regional Office in Almaty, the U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe, USAID grantees and contractors, other donors, the Government of Tajikistan, and AID/Washington.

7)	Supervise the Public Outreach efforts of the Country Office:  assisting in the development of newsletters and press releases on assistance programs and ensuring that all outreach and media materials are of a high quality, coordinating with Public Outreach and Communications Specialist in Almaty and establishing a close working relationship with the Public Affairs section in the U.S. Embassy.

8)	Serve in the absence of the Country Office Director as a member of the U.S. Embassy/Dushanbe Country Team, the USAID representative to the Donor Coordination Council and its working groups and the USAID representative to the Joint Country Support Strategy core group.

USAID/CAR expects to award a personal services contract for an off-shore US Citizen for two-year period commencing as early as practically possible subject to security and medical clearances and funds availability.  The duty post for this contract is Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  

10.  Benefits include post differential, housing, and other benefits per USAID regulations.  Basic household furnishings, will be available in quarters to be provided by USAID. 

11.  Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe, is located in the extreme west of the country, about a one-hour drive from the border with Uzbekistan. Dushanbe was formed in 1922, when three small settlements of 5,000 people were united.  It became the capital when Tajikistan became an autonomous republic in 1924. The city lies in a sheltered river valley at 2,300 feet above sea level, below the Hissar Mountains. The Varzob and Kofarnihon Rivers flow through Dushanbe. Because of its sheltered location, Dushanbe is often spared the more extreme weather conditions prevalent elsewhere in the region though this is not true at all times.  Winters are similar to those in Washington, DC, with cool, damp weather and occasional snow.  However, last year was extreme exception when temperature dropped down to minus 22F.  Spring is generally mild and rainy, while Tajik summers are hot and dry, with temperatures in some areas well over 100 F.  Autumn weather is generally pleasant and dry.  In all seasons, temperatures can vary considerably during the course of the day. 
 
Now a city of 700,000, Dushanbe in its center retains the atmosphere of its original planners in the 1920s  wide, tree-lined streets with mostly low-rise apartment houses and office buildings painted white or pastel colors. Although traffic has begun to pick up with increased availability of gasoline, it is still comparatively light.  Because of the trees, walking or bicycle riding is pleasant much of the year.

<DESC>Repair CE Headquarters Heating System 

Location of work: Eielson AFB, Alaska

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY for Repair CE Headquarters Heating System on Eielson AFB, Alaska. OFFERS OR PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. THIS IS NOT A PRESOLICITATION OR SOLICITATION. The contractor shall provide all personnel, labor, equipment, supervision and tools necessary to: Install a complete, operational glycol heating system in building 2258 that will meet the heating demands of the building and adjust the glycol supply temperature based on outside air temperature to maintain a comfortable working environment with easily accessible thermostat controls for the building occupants.  The system must be capable of providing an indoor air temperature of 74F when the outdoor air temperature is -60 F (unless otherwise specified) and allow effective control to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures when the outside air temperature reaches 0F to 45F.  The heating system must extend throughout all four floors in the main portion of the building and integrate completely with the equipment previously installed for the glycol system.  The work will also provide and install a new metered high pressure steam supply line and associated condensate return line between the existing basement steam mechanical room and the new heat exchanger mechanical room.  The system will include appropriate drip legs, end of line traps, and a pressure-powered condensate station. The project was designed in a phased approach to allow phased implementation.  Ideally all the phases will be completed at once, but the design is broken out as follows:

Phase 1: install steam pressure reducing, steam flow control, and steam-powered condensate return stations in the mechanical room WORK TO BE COMPLETED IN 2008.

Phase 2: connect high-pressure steam service to the pressure reduction station installed in Phase 1. Install a new unit heater in the Drawing Vault (room adjacent to the mechanical room). Install the glycol header piping, and install controls to create a functioning system. To provide high-pressure steam service to the mechanical room, a tee connection will be installed upstream of the existing pressure reduction station and plumbed to the 5-inch low pressure steam line. This line will be converted to high pressure steam service during this phase (Notehigh pressure steam service is required to operate the new steam-powered condensate return station). This phase will require limited asbestos abatement to tie-in the 5-inch steam line to the 3  -inch steam line emanating from the utilidor.

Phase 3: install a new glycol supply/return loop piping system in the second floor ceiling, install new fin tube heating elements on the second and third floors, plumb the new fin tube heating elements to the glycol loop piping, and plumb the glycol loop to the glycol supply and return header located in the mechanical room. Lateral low pressure steam piping serving the second and third floors will be cut and capped during this phase, allowing low-pressure steam heat in the basement and first floor until phase 4 implementation. This phase will require limited asbestos abatement where the low pressure steam lateral lines are cut and capped.

Phase 4: remove the existing 3-inch steam distribution header located in the basement ceiling, install a new glycol supply/return loop piping system in the basement ceiling, install new fin tube heating elements in the basement and first floors, and plumb the new fin tube heating elements to the glycol loop piping. The existing steam pressure reduction station will be demolished during this phase. In addition, the existing condensate return line will be replaced from the mechanical room to the utilidor connection. This phase will require asbestos abatement to remove the existing steam distribution header and condensate return line.  

Work will be conducted during non-working hours (i.e., nights and weekends) to the extent practical to avoid disruption of building occupants and to allow efficient work execution.

Contractor shall comply with commercial and industry standards, and all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and procedures.  The magnitude of this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  (based upon FAR 36.204). The intent of this Sources Sought is to research qualified 8(a) firms with a primary NAICS code of 238220 for this upcoming acquisition.

<DESC>The US Army Office of the Project Manager Close Combat Systems (OPMCCS) iscurrently seeking qualified sources to complete a requirement to produce a blunt trauma hand grenade, a 12 Ga. launch cartridge, and a launch cup.  
The hand grenade must be a non-lethal fragmenting explosive device that produces an intense stinging effect without penetrating the bare skin within a radius of three meters (threshold), five meters (objective) from the point of detonation.  The detonation delay of the grenade (time between release of safety lever and detonation) must be 2.6 +/- 0.5 seconds.  The packaged and unpackaged grenade must be transportable in wheeled/tracked vehicles over a variety of terrain road, trail, cross-country, in helicopters, cargo aircraft, and ships. The packaged life of the grenade must be five years of protected uncontrolled storage and ten years of protected and controlled storage. The grenade must be capable of being stored in temperatures ranging from -50 degrees F to 160 degrees F. The grenade must be operational in temperatures ranging from 145 degrees F and 0 degrees F. The unpackaged grenade must show no evidence of damage or failure; must be safe for transportation, storage, and handling; and must be able to function normally after being submerged to a depth of one (1) meter for two (2) hours. The grenade must be size compatible with the carrying compartments of the grenade pouch found in the Non-lethal Capability Set (NLCS) (GSA # GSAATISASDD60D) (threshold) and individual load bearing vet/equipment (LBV/E) (objective). The grenade must be capable of being functioned when wearing standard issued cold weather gloves. The user of the grenade must be capable of restoring the grenade to its normal safe carrying configuration after removing the safety device. The grenade must have a sound output below the non-lethal limits of DoD 3000.3. It must have an economically compatible re-loadable device for training in multiple environments.  The reloadable device shall replicate the hand grenades fuze timing/delays sequence. It must be noted if there are any perchlorates used in the grenades.
The launch cartridge is to be designed for use in the Mossberg 500A2 (NSN 1005-01-371-5639) shotgun chambered for 3 inch cartridges and the Remington 870 Modular Combat Shotgun. The launch cartridge shall produce sufficient energy to launch both the blunt trauma hand grenade and the re-loadable training grenade to a minimum range of 60 meters (threshold) and 90 meters (objective) when fired from the elevation corresponding with maximum range. 
The launch cup is to be able to contain the hand grenade and its re-loadable trainer and be attached to the end of the Mossberg 500A2 shotgun and Remington 870 Modular Combat Shotgun. The launch cup must be able to be securely and manually attached to the end of the Mossberg 500A2 shotgun and Remington 870 Modular Combat Shotgun. The total weight of the assembled launch cup (including all parts, fasteners, adhesives, etc.) must be 15 ounces or less (threshold) and 12 ounces or less (objective). The launch cup must be able to withstand a longitudinal pull (tension) force of 1,440 pounds minimum without permanent damage to any portion of the shotgun or launch cup. The launch cup must be able to withstand accidental detonation (i.e. grenade spoon outside of cup) of the blunt trauma hand grenade within the cup without creating cup fragments. The launch cup must be able to retain both the hand grenade and its reloadable training grenade within the launch cup when the shotgun is freely dropped. The launch cup must be able to sustain five successive drops of 30 inches, to include one each in five different orientations onto a concrete surface and still attach to the shotgun and launch both the hand grenade and the reloadable training grenade.
Any energetics used in these items must not contain potassium perchlorate.
The quantities of the blunt trauma grenades will range from 2,000 to 400,000, per year. The quantities for the re-loadable training grenade will range from 2,000 to 150,000 per year. 
The quantities of the launch cartridge will range from 2,000 to 300,000 per year.
The quantities of the launch cup will range from 3 to 5,000 per year.
Interested companies which believe they can meet the above requirements may also provide the US Army test data from independent testing for their product. The requirements in the required verification tests are operating requirements, projectiles, fuze, interface and interoperability requirements, grenade dimensions, fuze safety lever, environmental requirements, and support and ownership requirements.
Some examples for the environmental requirements testing are operating temperatures, electrostatic discharge, temperature and humidity, salt fog, water immersion, Jolt, Jumble, and extreme storage temperatures. Also, there are vibration tests, and drop tests as well as many other environmental tests. 
Interested companies which believe they can meet the above requirements shall provide the US Army a brief summary of their company's capabilities.  Responses should identify your current Business Structure: a. Name of Company  include a contact person's name, company address, telephone number, email address. b.

The procurement involves CARE certified personnel and parts being procured from the prime equipment manufacturer or its actual supplier.  Organizations having the expertise and required capabilities to provide the items and service are invited to submit complete information discussion such capabilities as follows:  (i.e. salient physical functional and serviceability characteristics) (1) show that they satisfactorily manufactured the parts for the Government or the prime equipment manufacturer; or (2) submit complete and current engineering data comparing the offered parts to the OEM to demonstrate the acceptability of the parts.  It is the Governments belief that only MSA and/or its authorized dealers and distributors can furnish the required parts and services and ensure the proper fit, form and function of all its components.  Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing capabilities in duplicate within fifteen (15) days of this announcement.

<DESC><p>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) will host a Technology Summit with Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) on 12-13 August 2008 at the Holiday Inn, 2800 Presidential Drive, Fairborn, OH 45325.
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) discovers, develops, and integrates affordable warfighting technologies for the United States air, cyber and space forces. AFRL leads the development of capability options that meet the needs of the Air Force, providing rapid solutions in response to urgent warfighter requirements, and conducting long-term research driven by a bold technology vision.</p>
<p>The purpose of this summit is to discuss what AFRL is calling "University Strategic Partnerships" with MSIs to develop long-term relationships in support of continued technical innovation. We view MSIs as an underutilized resource that is essential to meeting our future Research and Development (R&amp;D) requirements. In that vein, we want to ensure that the academic pipeline to the MSI community is in the forefront of new opportunities afforded by AFRLs execution of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Act. In order to facilitate these partnerships, AFRL is hosting an overview on 13 August 2008 of our Core Technical Competencies in each of our ten technical directorates: propulsion, sensors, munitions, space, directed energy, materials and manufacturing, human performance, air vehicles, information technologies and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.</p>
<p>All meetings and activities will be unclassified. Audience is limited to U.S. Citizens and green card holders only. Registration for the summit will start on 21 July 2008 and cost $150 - to cover breaks, a networking reception and lunch. Please register by 6 August 2008. This event is being sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory. Universal Technology Corporation is providing administrative support for the summit and registration. To learn more about AFRL Summit with Minority Serving Institutions and to register to attend, please visit the website at www.fbomsisummit.utcdayton.com, by phone (937) 426-2808 or by FAX (937) 426-8755.

<DESC><p>2008 Air Force/Industry Air Armament Technology Interchange Workshop for SBIR:<br />Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program's Transition Support (Commercialization Pilot Program (CPP)) One-on-One Sessions (24-25 September 2008)<br />This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the government in any way. Response to this request is voluntary and will not impact any future acquisitions. Please respond to the appropriate point of contact, within 15 days of the publication of this announcement with your intent to attend the workshops on 24-25 September 08. Please note that there are specific major contractor attendance criteria for the SBIR transition support CPP activity. Moreover, attendance by small businesses is by invitation only. <br />The goal of this Air Force SBIR initiative involves accelerating the transition of SBIR developed technologies to the warfighter. One approach we are implementing involves matching small businesses with on-going air armament-related SBIR Phase II projects to industry prime/supply chain contractors for one-on-one discussions. Interested prime/supply chain contractors must contact the AF POC to obtain a list of air armament related on-going Phase II projects from which they can select for one-on-one meetings. Based on industry prime/supply chain contractor selections, the AF will invite the associated small businesses to attend the SBIR Phase II project one-on-one meetings. <br />There will be a two-hour plenary overview, for qualifying contractors (see qualifying criteria below), where AFRL will present information about the AF CPP program and provide rules-of-engagement regarding the SBIR one-on-one sessions. Following that overview, the AF will hold SBIR one-on-one sessions. Twenty-five minutes will be allotted to each qualifying company interested in participating. The venue planned will be the Hilton Sandestin Resort, 4000 Sandestin Boulevard South, Destin, FL 32550, 850-267-9500; fax: 850-267-4602.<br />There is a $125/person registration fee associated with this event. The fee covers breakfast, lunch and snacks. Other details of the workshop and the criteria for industry participation are explained below:<br />One-on-one schedules will be sent at least 7 days prior to the date of the Workshops, 24-25 September 2008.<br />Restrictions: U.S. Defense companies only. In order to attend, you must be either a DoD employee or DoD contractor with a valid DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement.<br />Limitations: Due to resource constraints, and our expectations for responses to this announcement, we anticipate having to select a more limited group of companies to participate in these sessions. Our selection process will be explained below. A copy of this FedBizOpps announcement and any additional information can be found at http://www.wpafb.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=12017.
<p>Criteria for Attendance: For Prime contractors, we will use the following criteria for participants in the overview session (Overview and one-on-ones) to be held on 24-25 September 2008. <br />1. Meet the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFAR) 31.205-18(a) (iii) definition of a major contractor as identified in the following website -- http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/fardfars/dfars/dfars231.htm#P71_2101) or meet the Defense Contracting Audit Agency (DCAA) criteria of major contractor (which essentially means any contractor that had $90 million or more in annual auditable costs for the prior fiscal year). <br />And/or <br />2. DoD Prime contractor with a valid DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, Jul 2003. <br />Please note that invited small businesses must have a valid DD Form 2345 at the time of the workshop.</p>

The current period of performance will be extended to cover the period from 1 December 2008 to 30 November 2009. The modification will be issued to Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, 111 Lockheed Martin Way, Bldg 157, Sunnyvale, CA 94089. Classification code 22, identified at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, applies.
<p>The current Milstar/DSCS III satellite orbital operations support efforts include satellite engineering in support of satellite health, safety, system and mission operations; satellite subsystem analysis and evaluation for both normal and anomaly resolution based on detailed design knowledge; and data retention and telemetry analysis including support of unique software required to accomplish the analysis.

<SOLNBR>GPO-4493-2008

<DESC>Publication & Information Sales, P&IS manages inventory, performs order fulfillment, maintains an e-commerce Web site, operates a Contact Center, processes payments, submits invoices, and supports financial management with existing systems and processes.  P&IS system applications support two operations  Main GPO and Pueblo.  Main GPO primarily focuses on the GPO Sales Program, but also fulfills consigned subscriptions for Federal agencies.  Main GPO includes Headquarters, Laurel Warehouse, Bookstore, and Contact Center.  The Pueblo operation, located in Pueblo, CO, primarily focuses on consignment/reimbursable sales from Federal agencies and also stores inventory and fulfills orders for the GPO Sales Program.  

Currently, P&IS is looking to implement a Retail Order Fulfillment System (ROFS) using Oracle applications. The proposed ROFS consists of functionality to support the GPOs retail management of publications (books, maps, serials, videos, CD-ROMs, and subscriptions) for sale through the Superintendent of Documents as well as the GPOs order fulfillment services for other Federal agencies.  In addition, the ROFS will support the business operations of its staff. The proposed system encompasses all of the equipment, software, hardware, services, and documentation necessary for operations.

P&IS, akin to other GPO business units, is committed to implementing Oracle applications utilizing an incremental approach with the desire to eventually cease all existing functionality of Legacy systems and interfaces to those Legacy systems. Use of Oracle as an Enterprise Architecture is intended to provide streamlining and improvement of existing business processes. All implementations will be conducted using the Federal Enterprise Application Suite in the On Demand hosted environment in Austin, TX.

		
The objective of this contract is to obtain services for a single year, multi-release integration effort. The purpose of this effort is to integrate Oracle applications within Oracle On Demand. The applications to be integrated include the iStore (primary) and iPayment  OTS applications; additional modules from the emerging ERP may also be required to meet all specified requirements. The implementation contractor (IC) shall perform in compliance with the most current versions of the P&IS Concept of Operations (ConOps), P&IS Requirements Document (RD), and any other documentation provided as government furnished material (GFM).

The P&IS ROFS shall be developed and implemented jointly by GPO and the IC using GPOs Information Technology System Development Life Cycle Policy (SDLC) as a framework, but conforming to the Oracle On Demand implementation process. GPOs SDLC outlines the strategy for facilitating successful execution of IT projects at the GPO through a disciplined system engineering process. Systems development in the GPO environment is a specific effort to automate GPO activity (business processes) by using hardware, software, people, and procedures. It is incumbent upon the IC candidates to understand and present their approach to conforming with the On Demand implementation processes.

GPO plans to utilize a four (4) increment approach to delivering P&IS ROFS functionality. The 
initial increment consists of core functionality with limited or no customization or modifications to the base modules while the second,  third and fourth increment may include customization or other modification to the base modules. For this implementation, interfacing with previously-configured Oracle applications may be required. These applications, from the emerging ERP activity ongoing at GPO, include: Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Fixed Assets, Order Management and Inventory Management. The increments are as follows:
	Increment One:  All core functionality to display, advertise, and purchase single-copy sale publications to include payment through Pay.gov. 
	Increment Two: All core functionality to display, advertise, and purchase serial sale publications to include payment through Pay.gov.  Serial sale publications include regular and irregular subscriptions as well as standing orders.
	Increment Three: All functionality and interfaces required to communicate with book dealers and consignment partners.  This also includes implementing a Web interface and back-end fulfillment system to be utilized by the Pueblo, CO operation for GSA FCIC sales, and establishing an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) for agency partners and internal (GPO) customers.
	Increment Four:  Any additional enhancements not delivered in Increments 1-3.
Using this approach, each release will follow the SDLC driven series of Phases and Gates described in Section 2.5: Phases & Gates and Release Schedule Approach.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control&nbsp;and Prevention intend to issues a sole source contract or purchase order to the Medical University of South Carolina to perform an analysis of data collected for the South Carolina Health Outcome Project on Epilepsy and prepare reports for publication.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1): FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contact will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for informational purposes. This procurement is not set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>The purpose of this request is to perform an in-depth multivariate analysis of data from the South Carolina Health Outcome Project on Epilepsy in order to elucidate role of comorbidities as determinants of epilepsy outcomes.</p>
<p>b. The vendor will provide one or more reports of the analysis, including descriptive tables and figures ready for manuscript submission. This multivariate analysis will address determinants of epilepsy outcomes: (i) principal determinants-conditions that are comorbid at the time of epilepsy onset (neurologic, neuropsychologic, and general medical conditions); and (ii) associated determinants-epilepsy type and severity. The analysis will assess the relationships of these determinants with epilepsy outcomes such as seizure severity and frequency, secondary conditions, disability, and quality of life. Additional modifying variables (e.g., socioeconomic status (SES) and access to and utilization of medical care) will be considered. Data analysis will include the use of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to quantify the risk ratios the comorbidities of interest adjusting for other covariates in the model. Findings will be appropriately compared among demographic categories such as age, sex, and race.</p>
<p>2. Projects, Programs or Activities Supported</p>
<p>Epilepsy Program, Arthritis, Epilepsy and Quality of Life Branch; Division of Adult and Community Health; National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>3. Objectives Served</p>
<p>The CDC Epilepsy Program conducts and supports numerous activities focused on the early recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of epilepsy; epidemiology and surveillance of epilepsy; and assessments of quality of life to improve the public health science and to improve health outcomes among the more than 2 million U.S. adults affected by epilepsy. Identifying comorbidities of epilepsy and their distribution in diverse populations, improving access and quality of care, and improving outcomes in people with epilepsy were identified as a priority areas at the 2003 Second National Conference on Public Health and Epilepsy.</p>
<p>Comorbid neurologic, neuropsychologic, and general medical conditions that occur with epilepsy strongly influence the severity and frequency of seizures and other outcomes such as disability and quality of life. While many studies have been able to identify the types of comorbidities that are associated with epilepsy, the extent to which these comorbidities determine the outcome of epilepsy is unclear. The SC Health outcome Project on Epilepsy has access to clinical data on a cohort of epilepsy patients that can be used to assess the outcome of epilepsy as a function of pre-existing comorbdity. The plan to assess this relationship relies on compiled clinical data from epilepsy verification forms that are completed by the physicians, linked with healthcare encounter data and data compiled from participant interviews. The data collected by the South Carolina Health Outcome Project on Epilepsy constitute a unique population-based dataset by virtue of: (1) representing a state with large minority population (largely African American), and (2) providing a wealth of detailed information collected regarding epilepsy comorbidities, severity, and outcome as well as related modifying variables and risk factors. Thus, it affords an exceptional opportunity to understand-and identify effective public health interventions for-modifiable causes of adverse outcomes among people with epilepsy. Products will include a multivariate analysis focused on the role of epilepsy comorbidities in predicting outcomes of interest (including seizure severity, disability, and quality of life), taking account of basic demographic categories, type and severity of epilepsy, SES, and healthcare access and utilization.</p>
<p>4. Client Identification</p>
<p>These data will enable the Epilepsy Program of the Arthritis, Epilepsy, and Quality of Life Branch to provide, for the first time, detailed population-based descriptions of epilepsy outcomes and their principal determinants, including in racial and ethnic minorities. These descriptions will enable policy makers to develop effective primary and secondary public health prevention strategies on behalf of people with epilepsy. This project will be exempt from review by the CDC IRB because CDC staff will have no interaction with study subjects or with identifiable data and CDC scientists will be limited to a consultant role.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK:</p>
<p>a) BACKGROUND. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) owns/operates four DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft in various locations throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada. It has been determined that one of these DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft will be based out of the Monterey Bay area of California to be operated in support of critical marine mammal surveys, law enforcement and marine sanctuary related research. Due to the maritime environment of the central west coast, it has been determined that the aircraft will be based in a hangar while not operational. Currently the Twin Otter aircraft is expected to be hangared during November 2008 thru May 2009. The hangar will protect the aircraft from the environment as well as protect the flight crew and maintenance personnel while performing routine maintenance and pre and post-flight activities.</p>
<p>SCOPE . DHC-6 Twin Otter N56RF S/N 788 is scheduled to arrive in Monterey, CA in mid November to stage for additional tasking along the west coast.

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, have determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to issue an order to Entertainment Associates, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and is for the international television programming broadcast rights.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.
  
This announcement constitutes the only notice, a written solicitation will not be issued.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all proposals received by the closing date specified in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Solicitation/synopsis reference number 316482056478 is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) and incorporates the following with the word quoter substituted for offeror.  

Provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-22 effective 23 NOV 2007. 

(1)  FAR 52.212-1 (Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items) (JAN 2005):
(a) Re para (a):  NAICS 512120; small business size standard is $27 million.
(b) Note that para (k) requires quoter to be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at time order is issued and throughout performance.
(2) FAR 52.212-2 (Evaluation  Commercial Items) (JAN 1999) with the following insertion in para (a) lowest priced technically acceptable quote with acceptable past performance.  Technical evaluation will be whether quoted items satisfy all requirements in CLIN 0001  descriptions below.

This contract action for commercial items of supply incorporates DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  The most common method of electronic submission of payment requests is by Wide Area Workflow (WAWF.)  Options within WAWF include a, stand-alone invoice and a combo that includes both the payment request and the receiving document required to validate the object of the invoice has been received in an acceptable condition.  The experience of this office in the administration of electronic invoices has shown that the use of  the combo invoice, when available,  will result in much quicker more accurate payment.  The matching by the WAWF system of invoices and receiving reports individually submitted by the vendor and the receiving activity routinely cause problems because they do not appear together and must be individually matched and then verified.  The use of the combo does not present this problem and avoids the attendant delays associated with matching. Self registration for the use of WAWF can be accomplished at https://wawf.eb.mil/index.html . Training on the use of WAWF for the submission of invoices is available on line at http://www.wawftraining.com.

(4) Quotations must include completed copy of provision at FAR 52.212-3 (Offeror Representations and Certifications  Commercial Items) (MAR 2005) with Alt 1 (APR 2002) or indication that reps and certs are in ORCA.

<SOLNBR>08M000133
<RESPDATE>080708
<CONTACT>Raleigh Tanner, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-260-8856, Fax 202-690-6630, Email raleigh.tanner@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC>SAMHSA/CMNS/OD through the Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Stragegic Acquisition Sourcing, Division Acquisition Management intends to sole source to the NYS Psychiatric Institute to perform the Professional Services, Simplified Acquisition. The proposed contractor is uniquely qualified  to the international scope of previous work and is the only contractor that has a current agreement with the participating member countries and teh sole mechanism in which to conduct this collaborative study.

BACKGROUND:

The International Initiative for Mental Health Leadership was organized several years ago to facilitate the transfer of knowledge about mental health among leaders in English speaking countries (UK, US, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand).  It has held several conferences and sponsored exchanges of leaders between its member countries.  One year ago, it was decided that the Clinical Leads (generally senior psychiatric leaders in each country) should meet to consider what work they might do that would facilitate the exchange of ideas and information.  They met at CMHS in Washington DC in September 2007, joined by psychiatric leadership from the Netherlands.  At this meeting, a number of projects were considered. The idea of a comparative survey of national (and sub-national) clinical performance and outcome measures was selected because of its practical value in informing each member state about approaches being used elsewhere, possibly allowing comparative studies of services in the future.  It also appeared to be doable as an initial effort.  None of the clinical leads was aware of this information being collected and classified anywhere else, so it was felt that this work was a critical first step in comparative studies.

7. OBJECTIVE

1.   Aims of Project
i.    Overall, to raise awareness amongst clinicians and policymakers regarding the quality of care of the mental health systems they are working in across a number of countries (Australia, New Zealand, United States, Canada, Scotland, Netherlands- and, possibly, England and Ireland)
ii.    To develop a matrix of clinical and system performance measures that clinicians and  administrators may consider in addressing quality issues in the provision of mental health services
iii.    Develop a matrix of population mental health indicators that may be considered in addressing the outcomes of mental health: promotion, prevention and intervention activities 
iv.   Ultimately, to be able to compare system performance across countries

The analysis will be based on literature review, interviews with country lead Medical Directors and health care providers. Using an evidence base, the report will provide a standardized framework for the comparison of the quality measures across the identified countries. Regular updates on its results will be made available to interested parties through pre-existing collaborative efforts among the countries of interest, such as the International Initiative for Mental Health Leadership (IIMHL meetings and web-resources, the 2006 ENMESH meeting, as well as other conferences and journals).

<p><span style="color: #000000;">A single award is anticipated when funds become available on or before September 30, 2008. USUHS reserves the right to award without discussions. All questions must be directed by email to <a href="mailto:kshelton@usuhs.mil">kshelton@usuhs.mil</a>. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The USU Security Office and the USU emergency response community are seeking a single enterprise-wide electronic Emergency Notification System (ENS).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are seeking an electronic notification system to ensure the health and safety of the USU community (students, staff and faculty) working and learning at all USUHS facilites. An electronic system will provide a very timely notification process with multiple means of contacting the community. A single enterprise solution could provide a consistent readily accessible medium for use, satisfy the needs of multiple stakeholders, and provide a single solution for training and maintenance purposes reducing the overall maintenance costs (time, training costs) of the solution</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We now use manual means of notifying the USU Community of emergencies, but there is considerable variance in the effectiveness and efficiency of our current method.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The manual method is not satisfactory because it takes too long to notify and alert everyone, does not provide multiple redundant means of notification and involves too many steps in our process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">LEGISLATIVE COMPLIANCE:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Federal Preparedness Circular (FPC) 65, Federal Executive Branch Continuity of Operations (COOP), advises all agencies to be prepared in the event of a COOP catastrophe and declaration. A COOP declaration requires immediate and timely notification of the event to our community and that we provide direction to them. This initiative has a direct and material affect on USUHS ability to meet the requirements of FPC 65.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire the software and or services of a vendor that provides an electronic ENS accessible from the Internet or phone which can alert computers, cell devices, telephones and send notices via email that is cost-effective and provides total life-cycle support.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The system must be able to acquire user information from multiple sources including self-subscription (following authentication), Novell and Active Directory, file upload of account information and groups established through the vendors site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The migration should be smooth for our management and associates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SCOPE OF WORK:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ENS application will provide simple methods to quickly broadcast reliable information to pre-defined groups of people in emergency events.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vendor will provide support application from their location (this will be a remote requirement); however, the vendor is expected to assist with initial system set-up and initial user/administrative based training. Depending on the complexity of the vendors systems this will mean onsite visits during initial system deployment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system supports administrator defined, Novell and Active Directory defined users and groups, as well as administrator maintained opt-in groups. To initiate a notification, an authorized broadcaster initiates the broadcast from an ENS website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The authorized broadcaster selects predefined group lists with telephone numbers and other contact information such as cell device numbers and email addresses associated with them. The broadcaster sends alerts to one or multiple mediums to notify users (on computers, cell devices, telephones, email, web message or all of these simultaneously). The application attempts to contact the members of the lists using all means selected by the broadcaster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The status of the broadcast can be generated in a summary report or various reports by each medium (computer, cell, telephone) that provide the results of each message sent out by the ENS. Reports should be exportable in spreadsheet or .PDF format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ENS should be capable of supporting a population of 2,500 for multiple devices for a minimum of six notifications per year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ONSITE MEETINGS AS REQUIRED:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>During the implementation phase of this contract, the contractor will attend onsite meetings with the USU staff as required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contractor personnel should hold security clearances at the secret level or above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-08-R-625B70 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-25.  This is a small business set-aside procurement.  The NAICS is 336611.  
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Anticipated award date is no later than 1 August 08. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 31 July 2008.  PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION.  Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Tracey Burgess at 252-335-6790.  Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the nomenclature; part number; unit price and extended price, FOB point; payment terms and any discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate I.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) technical acceptability which is pass/fail (step 1); (2) technical quality of the product (step 2); and (3) price.</p>
<p>The Government will perform a two-step evaluation. In step one, the initial evaluation will ensure that the sample is in compliance with the stated requirements (e.g., compliance with the Buy American Act, presences of the embroidery or imprint, correct color).

We require a digital photo of the nameplates for both amperages of breakers to gain the necessary data for quotation by GE.<br /><br />Answer: We do not have digital photo of the data plate for the 2000A frame breaker available. Again, two breakers are en-route to Travis for vendor/manufacturer getting the contract to evaluate.</p>
<p><br />6. Also, is there anything against putting in multiple quotes, being that we work with so many companies?</p>
<p>Answer: You can put in multiple quotes if the proposed product matches our specifications.</p>

*Is there an anticipated completion date for the associated earthwork and subgrade preparation?
B) The anticipated completion date for the preparation would have been August 1st.  However, there is a delay to this preparation and this may delay the start of the pavement by up to several months.



*What is the design thickness of the proposed asphalt layer?
C) The planned thickness will be 3" so as to allow our aircraft tow tractors to drive on.



*Does the proposed design include a thickened edge?  If so, what is the cross section - dimensions?
D) There should be no need for a thickened edge



*What is the required tonnage of asphalt needed on a per hour basis?
E) Standard industry practice.



*Will the government provide assistance [security clearance] in accessing the Base for the delivery trucks?
F) The materials truck will need to check in at the gate to enter the base.  The Air Force will provide them with the authorizations to enter the base but they will still need to go through the security check at the gate.  This will include a driver's license, registration, and proof of insurance.  This should not be an area that involves CBP.  The CE will contract with the local company and provide the directions for the company.






*Does the Government have a specific haul route within the Air Force Base?
G) Same situation as paragraph F.  The Air Force will give them directions for getting to our ramp.



*Are there any special flight line requirements pertaining to signage, flagging, or strobe lights on delivery trucks?
H) There will be no specific signage requirements for the trucks.  The Air Branch will need to move our aircraft prior to beginning the construction.

We need sufficient materials for 60 miles of fence with appropriately spaced gates, posts, etc. conforming to terrain.   

Fence Style:

Standard 4-wire fence construction with metal stays.  Smooth wire will be the bottom wire.  All line wire will be dead ended at gates, corners and line brace posts.  All metal posts will be placed so that the spade is completely below the ground.  If in hard rock, the hole will be drilled to allow the steel post to be placed into the ground.  

Braces: Braces will be constructed every  mile at each gate and at each change in the fence alignment (corner) according to Forest Service standards.  Rock cribs or rock jacks may be substituted for steel braces if appropriate and agreed upon in advance.  Three-five post brace corners and/or diagonal end braces will be installed in all locations where a corner is formed.  Post pipe shall be buried 39 in the ground (except 24 in rock).  Line braces shall be constructed at a minimum distance of  mile, as well as at the crest of hills and the base of all drainages.  In draws where the fence wire has a tendency to pull the steel posts out of the ground, a rock or steel post anchor shall be placed at these points.  

Creek crossings:  at any major creek crossings, a separate fence will be built across each creek crossing to prevent the main fence from being destroyed in the event of high water or flooding.

Gates: all gates encountered along the fence are to be considered part of the fence.  All gates will be 16.5 (rod) wide.  Gates are to be built at a ll previous locations and will be built with 4 strands of barbed wire, two wooden posts and 48 metal stays.  Smooth wire will be used on the gate post except for the mechanical latch.   

Terrain:  the elevation runs from approximately 4000 to 7500.  The terrain rolls with draws, steep hillsides, some rock outcrops, talus slopes, as well as sagebrush, aspen, mahogany and grassland along the unburned portions.  Clearing will be done by the contractor or permittee with hand tools or a chainsaw.  Clearing is only necessary to ensure the fence is straight between braces.

(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.

Additional FAR and DFARS clauses required by the regulations will be included.
Local DMC clauses, 52.0100-4028 (Contract Contact Information) (DMC) (JUN 2005) and 52.0100-4094 (Marking Instructions for All Items to Include Drop Ship and Direct Shipment) (JUN 2004), will be included. 

To be shipped to: 
			Defense Media Center/DCIC
			23755 Z Street Bldg 2730
			Riverside CA 92518

			
Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, have determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

<DESC>Answer to Questions received on Combined Synopsis/Solicitation W15QKN-08-R-0461
1.	Does the Army intend that the frequency range of 2.0  4.0 GHz be         covered completely by this system; a continuum of frequencies so        to speak?
Ans:  No, but it would take more tubes to cover that band.
2.	How much peak and average RF power does the magnetron system need to         provide?
Ans:  Please see attachment to this file charts.zip 
3.	What pulse widths and duty factors for the system?
Ans:  Please see attachment to this file charts.zip
4.	Does the Army have any preferred limit on the working voltage for the         magnetrons?
Ans: The only preferred limit is that the voltage provided will operate the      magnetron.
5.	Will there be any reflected energy from test objects to contend with?
Ans:  Yes, since we are radiating metallic munitions. 
6.	What is the significance of line 4 of the minimum system performance         requirements in mentioning the milotron tube?
Ans:  Each contractor has its own system performance. 
7.	Does the output power specified in line 5 apply to the milotron tube         or the magnetrons, or both?
Ans:  Yes, any tube.
See attachment for question 2 and 3.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.

<DESC>A001: Amendment No.1: 

Questions: 

1.       The SOW implies that the DM Contractor is to Travel to the KRG only; please confirm that this is correct and no travel to Baghdad is needed.

Answer:
1.  Correct, travel to Baghdad is not necessary. 

Question:
2.       Although the KRG is relatively autonomous, it is tied to the central government in Baghdad (in one way or another).  Has TDA taken this into consideration in the design of this DM?

 Answer:
2.  Yes, USTDA has taken this into consideration. 

Question:
3.       Given our experience in the KRG, it is of vital importance to utilize local (KRG) sub-contractors and/or individuals in any similar assignment.  This is due to a number of reasons, most important of which is the language barrier as many KRG government officials do not even speak Arabic; let alone English.  The question is whether TDA is flexible on the extent to which the DM Contractor can utilize local expertise as part of this DM given the countrys special circumstance?

Answer:
3.      Annex II in the RFP states Award is limited to U.S. firms or U.S. individuals.  Contractor and U.S. subcontractor employees used shall be either U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States.  Contractor use of subcontractors is limited to less than fifty percent of the proposed price.  International transportation and insurance must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States.  Local lodging, food, and transportation in the host country are not subject to this restriction. 

Question:
4.       Is there an estimated timeframe for this; with Ramadan approaching, it might be best to have the field visit conducted in October; is TDA open to this time table?

 Answer:
4. USTDA prefers that travel for this DM be completed before Ramadan.   

Question:
5.       Would the Medevac and other insurance requirements be waived considering that Medevac does not issue insurance to Iraq and Afghanistan?

Answer:

5.     As far as we know, medical evacuation insurance is available in Iraq.  We have found coverage policies through a number of carriers.  They would not cover emergencies related to the war and would not evacuate with civilian vehicles if the situation did not allow for civilian vehicles to operate.  The DM is traveling to Erbil, which is fairly removed from the warzone.

<DESC>Question # 1<BR>Subject: RFP No: W91QUZ-08-R-0033. Reference: RFP Section L, Paragraph(s) L1. Proposal Submission, Page(s) 57, the RPF states The due date for communications and questions concerning the RFP is 15 August, 2008. It further states the Proposal Due Date and Time is 1600 hours (Eastern Time) on 22 August 2008. This timeline does not appear to provide the government adequate time to review, evaluate and respond to vendor submitted questions that could result in format or requirement changes and allow vendors adequate time to revise proposals.  Would the government consider revising the questions due date to August 1, 2008?<BR><BR>Response # 1<BR>15 August is when the Government will stop accepting RFP questions.  Questions are answered within a couple days of submission via modifications of the Pre-Solicitation.  The question due date will not be changed at this time. <BR><BR>Question # 2<BR>Reference: RFP Section L, Paragraph(s) L.2.2.3 Part 3  Past Performance, 5) Past Performance Assessment Questionnaire, Page(s) 62, the RPF states The offeror shall complete Part II, A and B of the Past Performance Assessment Questionnaire and e-mail the questionnaire to both the Contracting Officer for this procurement, and to the Government or company POC responsible for the past/current contract.  Can you please clarify the term the Contracting Officer for this procurement?  Is the government seeking two past performance questionnaires for each past/current contract, one from the Contracting Officer and one from the Federal manager (indentified as a POC)?  Or are Offerors to provide William Giles a copy of the partially completed questionnaire?<BR><BR>Response # 1<BR>The Contracting Officer for this procurement is William L. Giles (william.L.giles@us.army.mil).  Offerors shall provide William L. Giles with a copy of the partially completed Past Performance Questionnaire that the offeor submits to the past/current contract POC to complete.  The Contracting Officer for this procurement then will receive a partially completed Past Performance Questionnaire from the Offeror, and a completed Past Performance Questionnaire from the Offerors POC.   <BR><BR>Question # 1<BR>Reference: RFP Section L, Paragraph(s) L.2.2.3 Part 3  Past Performance, Page(s) 61, the RPF states Offerors shall submit a description of all Government contracts (prime contracts and major subcontracts) performed during the past three (3) years that are relevant to the efforts required by this solicitation. A 5 page limit does not provide sufficient page count for submitting a description of all government contracts similar to this procurement. Would the government consider the most relevant past performance?<BR><BR>Response # 1<BR>Please refer to Amendment A0001, Section L.2.2.3 of the RFP posted on the ASFI and FedBizOps on 07/23/08.<BR><BR>Question # 1<BR>Reference: RFP Section L, Paragraph(s) L.2.2.3 Part 3  Past Performance, Page(s) 62, the RPF states (3) Section 3  Subcontracts.  Offerors shall provide the above required information for any proposed subcontractor who will perform a portion of the effort.  Offerors shall also identify the work to be assigned for performance within the offerors corporate entity and among each of the proposed subcontractors. A 5 page limit does not provide sufficient page count for submitting descriptions of the prime contractor and any proposed subcontractor government contracts similar to this procurement (especially with the potential for multiple proposed subcontractors). Would the government consider the most relevant past performance from the prime and any proposed subcontractors (realizing that Offerors may not submit past performance for all proposed subcontractors due to page limitations)?<BR><BR>Response # 1<BR>Please refer to Amendment A0001, Section L.2.2.3 of the RFP posted on the ASFI and FedBizOps on 07/23/08.<BR><BR>

These regulations are available electronically at the Air Force (AF) FAR Site, http://farsite.hill.af.mil and will be used to obtain the best value for the Government for this acquisition. In using the best value approach, the Government will award to an offeror who gives the greatest confidence that they will best satisfy our requirements in an affordable manner. The draft Performance-Based Work Statement (PWS) and draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted incrementally on the internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. This synopsis constitutes one form of early industry involvement and the Government requests industry recommendations, opinions, and feedback. Interested vendors should provide information detailing company's capabilities of performing maintenance and repair of bollard and barrier systems type services. This synopsis is for planning purposes and market research only, and does not constitute a solicitation for bids/proposals. Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way or solicit offers from all responsible sources. Prospected vendor must provide proof of registration through the Central Contract Registration (CCR) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). If claiming small business status, verification of such status must be identified in the company's CCR and ORCA registration. The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement.</p>
<p>5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timeliness for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Douglas P. Constant, AFFTC/PK, 5 S Wolfe Avenue, Edwards AFB CA 93524-1185, phone number (661) 277-2006, facsimile number (661) 277-3784. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of  this modification is to delete the original synopsis in its entirety and replace with the following:

Airborne Network Technology Review Days

The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate of Rome, NY is participating in the 4thAnnual Airborne Network Technology Review Days to be conducted at the Radisson Hotel and Conference Center in Utica, New York on 5-7 August 2008, sponsored by the Erie Canal Chapter (NY) of AFCEA. The objective of the Review Days is to provide a forum for industry and academia to discuss with government representatives the technologies required for formulation of the deployable airborne network(s).  These Review Days will highlight approaches and current plans by the DoD to deploy airborne networks, with special emphasis this year on "Science...Delivering Tactical-Networking to the Warfighter".  Participants will have the opportunity to engage government leaders, researchers and scientists on approaches to solving the obstacles of networking airborne assets, review technology demonstrations, and discuss various experiments and practices. AFRL, Rome NY; along with NRL, Washington DC, and CERDEC, Ft Monmouth NJ, are assisting with and participating in this years AFCEA conference.
 
This years Review Days feature: a) Keynote addresses from the Commander, Air University, LtGen Allen Peck; the Director, Warfare Integration (N6F), RADM Sandy Daniels; and the Commander 8th AF and JFCC-GSI, LtGen Robert Elder; b) overviews and technology briefs from the Military Services and DARPA on their perspectives for implementing an airborne network, c) technology presentations from government and non-government researchers, plus d) two Technology Panel sessions focused on the concept and design process [M&S, Emulation, Rapid-Prototyping, and Test & Experimentation] leading to the development and fielding of a warfighter network.

In conjunction with the Review Days, AFCEA is also hosting the Airborne Network Technology Expo 2008 during the social hour on Wednesday evening, 6 August.  The purpose of Expo 2008 is to provide industry an opportunity to present their perspectives on advancing airborne network technology and to facilitate discussions among academia, industry and government (military and civilian).  Due to space restrictions, Expo 2008 is limited to standard Poster Boards and/or PowerPoint/PC Demo presentations.  You may select one or any combination of the two methods.  Each method of presentation MUST relate to advancing airborne network technology.  Expo 2008 is being held at the Radisson Conference Center and space is limited so only two per company site will be allowed.  Also because of the limited space, selection will be on a first received basis.  

Additional Review Days details, registration and Expo information are available at: http://www.afceaeriecanal.org/ant/.

Unfortunately, we request that organizational participation at the Review Days be limited to a maximum of two (2) individuals per organizational location as the total attendance will be limited to 300 persons.  Attendees must be US Citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens. Proof of status is required for registration. Clearances are not required and all discussions will be unclassified. Note: this is NOT a "bidder's conference" and this announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind. The Government will NOT assume liability for costs incurred by an offeror for presentations, marketing efforts or data offered for examination; therefore the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government. 

Registration is available now through http://www.afceaeriecanal.org/ant/.

The Registration Fees are as follows: Early Bird (received by COB 26 July) - $425; 27 July to 2 August - $525; at the door - $625. The Review Days registration fee includes conference costs, continental breakfasts, lunches, free parking and refreshments for each day, handout materials, a banquet on Tuesday, 5 August and a social hour at the Expo 2008 with heavy hors doeuvres on Wednesday, 6 August 2008.

NOTICE: Since attendance at the conference is limited to 300 attendees, only the first 300 paid registrations will be accepted.

<DESC>This requirement is a non-commercial contract. Award will be made in the form of a Stand-alone, to one responsible offeror. A firm fixed-Price (FFP) type contract is anticipated for this effort with a Period of Performance of less than one year.  However, the Government encourages interested offeror to provide feedback on a suggested Contract Type other than Firm Fixed Price that would increase efficiency and/or maximize performance. The anticipated basic contract will specify the requirements to be delivered in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW).  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.  NAWCTSD has received tasking to research the feasibility of a contract to replace the visual projector system of the Full Mission Bridge Simulator at the Surface Warfare Officer School (SWOS), Newport, RI.  This trainer, the Conning Officer Virtual Environment Full Mission Bridge (COVE FMB), provides a simulated ship's bridge with a 360 degree horizontal field of view of the marine environment using 12 Barco Sim 4 projectors in a 5:4 aspect at 1280x1024 raster. The purpose of this sources sought posting is to replace the Sim 4 projectors with new state of the art, 3 chip digital light processor (DLP) or liquid crystal on silicone (LCOS) projectors.  Also, as part of this upgrade, it requires the design and installation of a support structure to hold the projectors located above the pilot house mock-up that must be based from the concrete floor and not the raised deck.  A metal or other high strength non-shifting material is required to be used to build this support structure.  The intent of the support structure requirement is to increase the rigidity of the projector mounting and decrease the vibration induced from the mock up bridge structure, to prevent miss alignment of the projectors.  This trainer is located indoors in a climate controlled space (please see attachment).  

The performance of the display upgrade is expected to change for the better in comparison to the existing display system, to include resolution, contrast, brightness, color matching, edge blending, and uniformity across all display channels. Automated tools are to be included for the maintenance and alignment of the display system. As part of the installation, instruction shall be provided to the on site maintenance personnel at SWOS in set-up and maintenance of the new projector system.  A warranty is also desired for the performance of the projectors and components of this upgrade, to include, but not limited to mechanical defects.  Multi-year warranties or maintenance plans are preferred.   All warranties must be transferable to the Government.

The overall tasking will include selection, procurement, installation, testing, design, documentation, and integration of a complete display system to include integration with the COVE FMB training system software (Computer Science Corporations Vship).  

Responses to this notice shall include narrative identifying the scope of past and present (within the last 3 years), relevant experience on similar contracts (include dollar value, complexity and point of contact), a description of core capabilities relating to the performance of the subject effort.  Additionally, interested parties should submit a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) identifying a suggested Contract Line Items scheme, which estimates pricing for each recommended deliverable. All interested parties shall specify the current business size of their company.


Information should be sent via e-mail david.yarde@navy.mil. Alternative submittal methods by mail to: NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division, ATTN: Code 25331 (D. Yarde), 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826-3275. Responses are requested by 8 August 2008. The submission of this information is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any services, or for the Government to pay for the information received. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME. Questions concerning this requirement should be directed to Contract Specialist, David Yarde, via email at david.yarde@navy.mil or by telephone at 407.380.4086.

<DESC>Due to some popular questions, this modification is being issued to address several vendor's concerns.
1. There is a typographical error in the specifications.  The end user requires a 7 foot clear height in carriage and a maximum VRC height of 9 feet at upper level, above the mezzanine.
2. End user is looking for 24 Volt AC, not 24 Volt DC.
3. PNS will accept the lift when it is ready, however, installation must be performed upon completion of the mezzanine, at a date provided after contract award.
4. The lift must be delivered to the jobsite by the vendor, where it will be received and unloaded by PNS (Portsmouth Naval Shipyard).
5. Pit will be made by PNS per Wildeck VRC Specs provided by vendor.
6.  A new concrete floor is being installed with rebar.
7. Vendor will need to contract for an electric fork lift.
8. PNS will provide all necessary electrical work required for proper installation, including main feed lines, fuse disconnects, etc.
