<DESC><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION</strong>
<p>The United States Naval Test Pilot School (UNSTPS) is seeking information from available sources to support the Variable Stability Helicopter program. Support must include a near-off the-shelf solution to a limited authority Variable Stability System (VSS) to be installed in USNTPS Army UH-60L helicopters.&nbsp; The VSS is being sought for training purposes only (vice flight research) such that only the limited authority (10%) Stability Augmentation System (SAS) actuators for the pitch, roll, and yaw axes are required to be under VSS control.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall have designed and installed a VSS in an <strong>H-60 variant</strong> helicopter for use in a teaching environment and have experience in airworthiness approval in military airworthiness processes for VSS aircraft.&nbsp; The VSS would be operated by a single safety pilot occupying the left seat of the UH-60L and have controls and displays easily used and interpreted by an Engineering Test Pilot. &nbsp;Classroom and flight demonstration and instruction will be provided by Government Academic and Flight Instructors.</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) to determine the ability of industry to provide the required capability in a UH-60L platform with a minimum of non-recurring engineering costs and schedule lead-time based on a proven H-60 variant VSS system.</p>
<p><br /><strong>DESIRED CAPABILITIES</strong></p>
<p>The VSS shall allow the in flight demonstration of the effects of varying stability and control parameters about the pitch, roll, and yaw axes of the aircraft.&nbsp; The variation in flying qualities shall be accomplished by sensing control and flight variables and using those signals to modify the input made to the upper controls using the production aircraft, limited authority, Stability Augmentation System (SAS) series actuators provided for the pitch, roll, and directional channels.&nbsp; Controls and displays shall be designed such that a single safety pilot can operate the VSS in an educational environment while safely operating the host UH-60L. &nbsp;It is required that the system be designed such that one or all axes (Pitch, Roll, Yaw) may be selectively under VSS control.&nbsp; Axes not under VSS control shall use the production SAS control laws. Demonstrations will be flown with the Flight Path Stabilization (FPS) off.</p>
<p>The features that can be varied shall include:</p>
<p>&bull; Rate feedback (Damping, 3 axes, pitch, roll, yaw)<br />&bull; Attitude feedback (pitch, roll, yaw)<br />&bull; Translational rate feedback (lat, long and vertical)<br />&bull; Forward path gain (Sensitivity, 3 axes)<br />&bull; Rate and control coupling to 3 axes and from all 4 inceptors<br />&bull; Time delay, 3 axes<br />&bull; Forward path lead and lag (1st order, 3 axes)</p>
<p><br />CAPABILITIES STATEMENT</p>
<p>Interested businesses are requested to submit a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 20 pages in length, single-spaced, 12-point font minimum) demonstrating their ability to provide the above capability to the Government.&nbsp; This document shall contain, as a minimum:</p>
<p><br />1. Company profile to include number of employees, annual revenue history, office location(s), DUNS number, and CAGE Code.</p>
<p><br />2. Prior or current experience in providing an H-60 variant VSS solution that meets the requirement of paragraph 4.0 of the attached draft SOW, including contract number, organization supported, and point of contact and contact information. Describe how your solution addressed the general requirements outlined at paragraph 4.0 and briefly describe how it satisfied the particular requirements described in paragraphs 4.1 - 4.5.</p>
<p>3. Describe how the following specific capabilities are addressed in the H-60 variant VSS solution described in question 2:</p>
<p>3.1 Describe your solution for successfully and safely taking control of the production H-60 limited authority Stability Augmentation Systems (SAS) Actuators while host aircraft automatic flight control systems remained operating normally and ready to regain production control.</p>
<p>3.2 Describe how your solution was used in an airborne H-60 teaching environment and operated by a single safety pilot.</p>
<p>3.3 Describe your ruggedized computer system and how your solution managed features, gains and pre-stored configurations.</p>
<p>3.4 Describe how you supported the military airworthiness effort to gain approval for installation and operation of the H-60 VSS.</p>
<p>4. Documentation that supports the deliverables of the paragraph 5.0 of the attached draft SOW.</p>
<p><br /><strong>RESPONSES</strong></p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a Capabilities Statement. Capabilities Statements in Microsoft Word for Office 2000 compatible format are due no later than 24 November, 2014, 15:00 EST. Responses shall be submitted via e-mail only to:</p>
