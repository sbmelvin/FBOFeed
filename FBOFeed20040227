<DESC>Contracting Office Address Minerals Management Service GovWorks (Franchise) 381 Elden Street, MS 2510 Herndon VA 20170 Description The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service intends to make a firm-fixed price award to any contractor whose proposal/bid conforms to all aspects of the solicitation to be issued.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal/bid represents the best value to the Government.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue one or more Purchase Orders in accordance with FAR 13, Commercial Items.    This full and open competition action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of The Department of Health and Human Services, Office on Women's Health.    1. BACKGROUND: Approximately 3 to 4% of the 250,000 homeless veterans across this county are women. Homeless women veterans present different needs with reference to privacy, gender related care, treatment for physical and sexual trauma, housing support, and care for dependent children. Due to these compounding issues very few programs are available to serve and appropriately meet the needs of this particular homeless population.      2. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this contract is to assess and identify the issues/problems of homelessness among women veterans, and to develop activities (in areas including clinical care, outreach/education, research, leadership and training), which will enable existing and new services to better meet the gender specific needs of homeless women veterans.   3. SPECIFIC TASKS: In this effort, the Contractor shall:       a.  assess and identify the issues/problems of homelessness among women veterans in the communities they serve (the needs assessment should address both pre-military, military, and post military factors that put women at risk for homelessness.);  b. develop activities which will enable existing and new services to better meet the gender specific needs of homeless women veterans and assess their impact on the women served; and  c. develop non-veterans age and race matched control groups in an effort to identify distinctive needs of female veterans.  4.    DELIVERABLES AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:  Deliverable shall include 1.  quarterly progress reports which shall include the contractor's assessment of specific impact of such problems encountered to date;   2.  a final technical report which shall include a summary of the assessment made on the health problems of homeless veteran women in the particular catchment area;  and 3.  a research article suitable for publication in a women's health journal.  5.    SPECIAL QUALIFICATIONS REQUIREMENTS:  The Contractor selected to perform this work must demonstrate a thorough knowledge of veterans and women's issues.  Current membership in National Centers of Excellence in Women's Health (CoEs) or the National Community Centers of Excellence in Women's Health (CCOEs) and a history of working woman veteran issues in concert with these agencies is highly desired.  The CoEs are unique academic health centers utilizing the expertise of a cadre of tenured talented world renowned faculty providing in-depth knowledge in the field of women's health.  The CCOEs are unique community entities.  Both Programs develop models of care for the nation integrating clinical care, research, leadership, education and outreach that are women-friendly, woman focused and woman specific.  Both programs have worked in collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs' specialized and comprehensive Woman's Health Centers.  6.    PLACE AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The contractor shall provide all facilities, labor, material supervision and equipment necessary to provide the service as specified.  The contractor shall gather information within their particular catchment areas.  The period of performance under this contract shall not exceed 18 months from the date of award.  7.   GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY: None.  8.    SECURITY CLEARANCE: No security clearance is required.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes; a separate solicitation will be issued.    However, all information received within fifteen (15) days of this notice will be considered by the Government.     POC:    Department of the Interior; Attention: Andrew Carrington, 381Elden Street - MS 2500; Herndon, VA 20170. Questions must be emailed to the attention of Andrew Carrington at Andrew.Carrington@mms.gov.    Contracting Officer: Mr. Dan McCarthy  Please submit questions in writing, via post or email.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the United States Air Force (USAF) Electronic Systems Center (ESC) Tactical Data Links, Gateways, and Network Management (TGN) System Program Office (SPO) to determine potential commercial sources capable of designing, developing, integrating, and implementing a program for the training, fielding, integration and support of tactical data link weapon systems.  The Link-16 TDL system is a key component of the data link systems that extends the range of the pilot's eyes and ears while airborne.  The Link-16 TDL system is currently being integrated into numerous US Air Force airborne and ground platforms and will provide improvements in the quality and timeliness of information to support more rapid battlespace decision analysis, increased situational awareness, and shorter decision cycle to advance information superiority and precision engagement.  For example, tactical datalinks give a warfighter on one platform access to sensor data generated by other platforms, and actions on one platform are depicted in near real time on the displays of other platforms.  The Tactical Data Links - Fielding, Integration and Support (T-FIS) contractor's prime responsibility is to support the development of training programs which complement the integrating of the Link 16 tactical data link weapon system into airborne weapon systems for a variety of USAF platforms.  The T-FIS contractor will travel to locations throughout the United States as well as numerous air bases in Europe and Asia to: train pilots and aircrew members on the newly integrated Link 16 capability; operate, monitor and support training exercises utilizing Link 16 hardware; and coordinate and develop plans and schedules that ensure initial training is accomplished/completed at the receiving units prior to the arrival of the new Link 16 capability. The purpose of this announcement is to help the ESC TGN SPO mitigate program cost, schedule and performance risks by identifying potential highly competitive firms for the T-FIS contract.  This announcement, together with the subsequent Government analysis of company submittals, will also help interested potential offerors make a more informed decision regarding their probability of success and determine whether or not they should proceed with a full proposal effort.  Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought Synopsis request.  The Government requests interested offerors submit a statement of their qualifications with respect to the key features discussed above and the criteria below.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to negotiate a sole source contract for Human Systems Integration Analysis Study with Human Systems Incorporated, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.  Human Systems Inc. knowledge base and technical experience in this area lends a huge advantage in its ability to provide a means to influence the design of infantry products into an integrated ensemble.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

The Marine Expeditionary Rifle Squad Program is tasked with integrating and modernizing the Marine Infantry Rifle Squad. Currently there are multiple Program Managers that conduct R&D, procure equipment, and provide Life Cycle and safety support for infantry equipment used by the squad. Since most of these items are procured with specific requirements for a specific item, integration requirements for the Marine Infantryman’s entire ensemble of equipment are often not considered. Influencing the human factors integration of equipment coupled with the diverse and arduous tasks the equipment must endure is a complicated effort that requires unique skills and experience to influence effectively. By conducting this integration effort, the equipment loads become more ergonomic with noticeable increases in capabilities by providing systems engineering and human factors approach into the system architecture.

Tasks: 

The following tasks will be conducted from Contract Date to September 2004. 

1) Conduct a Human Systems Integration analysis of the current Marine Rifle Squad equipment suite. Provide recommendations on items of Human Factors Integration and recommendations for improving the ergonomics and human factors of the ensemble. Provide a report on recommendations.

2) Review Government Furnished Information on Modeling and Simulation analysis of the Marine Equipment Ensemble and Assault Load Carriage analysis. 

3) Provide Human Systems Integration technical expertise, advice, and experience to assist the Marine Corps Combat Development Command Load Study IPT in their analysis effort to define the optimal load requirements carried by a Marine.

4) Utilizing a furnished suite of equipment, modify and fabricate approved recommended changes to the hardware into a prototype integrated suite of equipment. A list of furnished equipment will be provided.

5) Attend meetings and reviews with the Program Office as required. The Program Office will facilitate access to utilize U.S. Marine Corps Subject Matter Experts and User’s in obtaining information and issues associated with the current ensemble of equipment.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL-SSC) intends to negotiate a contract on the basis of Other Than Full and Open Competition IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1).  NRL will negotiate with L-3 Communications/GSI, 1801 McCormick Drive, Largo, MD 20774 for the development of software for generating an observational catalog for the Solar-B EIS.  The tasks will be divided into two sequential phases for development of the catalog forms: Phase I: a planned catalog which contains metadata describing EIS raster observations at the time of their scheduling. The contractor shall develop the planned catalog using a relational database modeled on the SOHO/CDS database system. The database shall be generated, populated, and maintained by a suite of well-documented and well–tested IDL routines in the Solar Soft library; Phase II: an asrun catalog which contains metadata describing EIS raster observations after their execution. The contractor shall develop the “asrun” catalog having the same relational database structure and metadata fields as the planned catalog. The main difference shall be that the metadata fields shall record raster observation parameters (e.g., start time, exposure, pointing) as they actually occurred.  Both catalogs shall be accessible with the IDL program EIS_CAT.  Phase II will be initiated only after satisfactory completion of Phase I.  Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm  See Numbered Note(s)22 AND 26

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute intends to purchase customized animal surgery packs and other disposable surgical supplies to support a centralized surgical facility at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Division of Veterinary Resources, Surgery Service Section.  Due to limited storage space in the Surgery Service, a readily available source of surgical supplies is critical to the objective of performing a wide variety of complex aseptic surgical and radiographic procedures.  The Surgery Service is the main centralized experimental surgical facility on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland, and supplies are needed for approximately 2,000 to 3,500 surgical and radiographic cases annually.  The Surgery Service has carefully developed the specifications which precisely define the exact product to accommodate their use on a wide variety of research animals of varying sizes.  The purpose of the specifications is to insure that their program continues to receive adequate quantities of various disposable surgical supplies with the level of durability, uniformity, consistency, and function that are needed and expected to conduct their program.  The selected specific items have been modified to customize the present animal surgery pack and other disposable surgical supplies.  The items in the pack are also limited to those items that are routinely used in order to cut down on unnecessary waste and cost of disposal.  The receipt of inferior products cannot be tolerated.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 423450, Size Standard 100 Employees will be used for this requirement.  This is a One Hundred Percent (100%) Small Business Set-Aside.  Interested parties should request a copy of the Request for Proposal (RFP) Number NHLBI-OR-P-04-036, from the address below.  Attention:  Melissa K. Lombardo, U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Division of Extramural Affairs, Contracts Operations Branch, Procurement Section, Rockledge II Centre, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Room 6145, Bethesda, MD  20892-7902.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a Multi-Anvil Pressure Module capable of generating the high pressures needed to study planetary materials under pressures equivalent to the deep interiors of planets, asteroids and the Moon.	NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Rockland Research Corporation.  The Rockland Research Walker multi-anvil module is able to generate pressures between 30 and 300 kilobars, equivalent to the pressure range defined by the center of the Moon to the core-mantle boundary of Mars.  The pressure module system consists of 6 tool steel wedges (anvils) within a forged alloy steel stress ring.  The anvils define a cubic cavity into which a stack of eight tungsten carbide cubes fit.  Each of the tungsten carbide cubes has a truncated face.  These eight faces define an octahedral cavity that is filled with a ceramic pressure medium.  Compression of this solid ceramic pressure medium generates pressure.  In addition, the pressure medium can be machined and shaped to allow use of small graphite or rhenium furnaces to heat samples while under compression.  This cannot be and is not matched by any other equipment.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 5, 2004.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Project is located in the Bull Run Watershed, Mt. Hood National Forest.  Access to project area is via Hwy. 26, east of Sandy, Oregon, Lolo Pass Road, north of Zigzag Ranger Station, and Forest road 10.  This work consists of decommissioning 11.6 miles of road in the Bull Run Watershed. Decommissioning involves excavation of culverts, stream channel restoration, decompaction of road surfaces, cross-ditching, outsloping, seeding & mulching exposed soils, and disposing of excavated culverts.  Road decommissioning is to be accomplished by hydraulic track-mounted excavator, crawler-tractor (dozer),  and dump truck.  Equipment will be paid by the hour.  Work is to be directed by the Contracting Officer’s Represenative (COR).  Culvert removal will involve excavation of approximately 5 large (40” diameter or larger) culverts which carry live streams.  Volume of excavation is estimated at 500 – 2000 cubic yards per culvert.  Stream diversion will be required to protect water quality. Approximately ten stream-carrying culverts smaller than 40” will be excavated. Volume of excavation may range from 20 - 500 cubic yards per culvert.   Stream diversion will be required to protect water quality.  All ditch-relief culverts will be removed – approximately 8 per mile for the entire 11.6 miles of road.  Crossdrains will be constructed as directed by COR.  Excavated soil is to be placed on the road surface and contoured (outlsoped) as directed by COR.  Immediately following earthwork, exposed soil is to be seeded with weed-free annual rye grass seed (Lolium multiflorum) and mulched with weed-free annual rye grass straw or wheat straw.  Seed shall be applied at the rate of 50 lb./acre.  Adjacent to live streams, government-furnished native grass seed shall be used.  Areas requiring gov’t.-furnished native seed will be designated by COR. Mulch shall be applied so as to provide cover over 100% of exposed soil and to a depth of approximately two inches.  Contractor shall provide manufacturer certification of species and purity for both seed and mulch.  Seed & mulch is not required on decompacted road surface.  Where necessary, roads may be minimally cleared of brush, downed trees, etc. to facilitate access to work sites.  Road clearing work is incidental to mobilization.  Trees and brush (slash) from excavated slopes will be placed on exposed soil as mulch, and spaced so as to allow for foot travel on roads and to facilitate revegetation (one layer deep). This operation will be paid under equipment time.  Live streams will be diverted from excavated areas to prevent soil from entering waterway.  A site specific water quality control plan must be submitted and approved for each stream diversion prior to start of excavation.  Such plans must include a sketch of stream channel showing how water is to be diverted and a description of equipment to be used.  Required equipment may include piping, sandbags, plastic sheeting, pumps, hoses and filters.  Pumps used for stream diversion must be capable of handling the full flow of diverted stream.  More than one pump may be necessary, as pumping may be needed at both inlet & outlet of excavated channel.  COR will monitor water quality before and during operations.  Work associated with stream diversion and water quality will be paid under Pay Items 1.5 and 1.6.  Diversion of streams flowing through culverts 40” in diameter or larger will be paid under pay item 1.5.  Diversion of streams flowing through culverts smaller than 40” will be paid under pay item 1.6.  Boulder “weirs” are to be constructed in designated stream channels as directed by COR.  
Excavated culverts become property of contractor and will be disposed of off National Forest land.  Loading & hauling of excavated culverts is incidental to mobilization.  Equipment time will not be used for sole purpose of salvaging culverts in an undamaged condition.  Asphalt road surfaces are to be decompacted with excavator or dozer equipped with ripper teeth.  Decompaction shall be to a depth of approximately one foot and cover approximately 75% of road surface. Asphalt surfaces on which soil is placed will also be decompacted.  Channel banks and excavated side-slopes will be “walked in” with tracked equipment or compacted by excavator bucket to reduce erosion.  A 75’ x 25’ x 20’ pile of excavated culverts is to be removed from road 1015030 and disposed of off National Forest land.  Culvert pile is located approx. 1.0 mile from road 10.  Road 1015030 can be used only during dry weather. Payment for this work will be incidental to mobilization.  A 12’ x 14’ x 65’ multi-plate steel culvert is to be excavated and removed from road 1015105, mp 0.7.    All work at this site including dewatering, excavation, seed & mulch, etc. will be paid under item 1.4.  A detailed plan of operation which includes water quality control must be submitted and approved by COR prior to start of work at this site.  As part of contract bid, an overall plan of operations must be submitted which includes: description of each piece of equipment to be used, schedule of work and estimated number of work days for each section of road, and  a general plan for stream diversion and water quality control.  Cost of moving equipment beteween work sites shall be incidental to mobilization.  Track-mounted equipment shall not be “walked” on asphalt surface roads, except those to be decommissioned.  Estimated price range is between $100,000 and $250,000.  Estimated start date is July 1, 2004 with 60 calendar days. Solicitations will be accepted until 4:00 p.m., April 13th, 2004.

To date 1200 lung cancer cases have enrolled and the available cases have provided as many as 10 tissue specimens (each) from over 250 surgically treated individuals.  This study is unique in that at the time of surgical operation fresh frozen tumor tissue was collected.  This is a continuation of an on-going study and Ms. Mann has successfully completed work with precisely this type of tissue (order 263-MQ-315103), she trained under the direction of Dr. Jin Jen (a leader in the investigation of the molecular genetics of lung cancer, who has produced pioneering work using this approach in lung cancer). She has experience in production level laboratory research, equipment manipulation and computer based data management systems and essential additional training in immunohistochemistry staining, human tissue processing and in related molecular biology projects.  Due to the unique nature of these one-of-a-kind specimens and the technically demanding nature of this study only Ms. Mann can satisfy programs requirement.  This procurement is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, showing they have completed similar work involving isolation of total RNA and preparation of target probes on fresh frozen lung cancer it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI staff to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 2:00 p.m. EST, on March 5, 2004.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services shall apply to any order issued from this Notice.

<DESC>This requirement is for the fabrication and building of a custom Fourier transform infrared spectrometer for use in a high-vacuum, (10^-9 Torr) cryogenic (15K) environment.  The BXR II is an infrared (2 – 30 micrometers wavelength) radiometer that is currently being designed at NIST.  The instrument is a high vacuum, cryogenic (15 K) device that incorporates a precise power measurement mode of operation and a high spectral resolution mode of operation.  At this time a large fraction of the BXR II design has been finalized.  In the current design, the BXR II samples a 7 cm diameter beam of infrared radiation and telescopes it down to approximately 1.5 cm. A field limiting aperture limits the divergence in the 1.5 cm beam to 5 mrad maximum, however it will typically be less than 1 mrad. In the precision power mode of operation the beam is directed towards a set of filters used for filter based radiometry. In the high spectral resolution mode of operation the beam is first directed through a proposed Cryogenic Fourier Transform (Cryo-FT) interferometer before passing through the filter based radiometer portion. At this time the Cryo-FT has only been designed in very rough terms and has been assigned a volume in the BXR II for its future existence.  A rough drawing of the current design configuration of the BXR II exists as an MS Word document, with the file name “BXR II Design Mod7.doc.” and will be provided as an attachment to the solicitation upon release.  The desired outcome of the contract for the Cryogenic-FT Design and Build is to build a Cryo-FT that is fully compatible with the BXR II and meets specific optical and compatibility requirements.  The delivered system shall be a complete and functional system. This shall consist of at least a vacuum-cryogenic Michelson interferometer that is to be placed into the BXR II, control hardware for the interferometer and software for remote control, data acquisition, spectra display and diagnostic work.***Delivery shalll be FOB DESTINATION and shall be completed not later than 20 months from the date of award.***This requirement is being procured using full & open competition.***The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), specifications, RFP amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFP number SB1341-04-R-0010.***The RFP is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about March 15, 2004, and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.
***Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the RFP in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.***No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained.

<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) requires a contractor for comprehensive development of a new system and/or management of the system currently maintained and operated as the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) System.  FBO serves as the single Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE) for federal agencies and contractors for federal procurement opportunities.  The acquisition will be a 100% small business set aside, and the contract will be “performance based”.  

FBO is mandated by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 5), and supports a key Federal E-Government objective on improving access to open market contracting opportunities through technology.    Through one portal, commercial vendors seeking Federal markets for their products and services can search, monitor and retrieve opportunities from the entire Federal contracting community.    Government buyers are able to publicize their business opportunities by posting information directly to FedBizOpps.  FedBizOpps can be found at www.fedbizopps.gov or www.fbo.gov       

The Government will release a Request for Proposal (RFP) using a Statement of Objectives (SOO), which will allow all offerors the flexibility to develop cost-effective solutions and have the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives meeting the stated objectives in the SOO.    The SOO shall be used by the offerors to develop their proposed Performance Work Statement, their Contractor Master Plan which includes their technical approach, performance standards, and a quality assurance surveillance plan, based upon commercial business practices, and any other documents required by the RFP.    

The RFP is expected to be released on or about 3/26/04.  Requests for the solicitation may be mailed to the GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION, ROBERT ABOOD, 10304 Eaton Place, Fairfax, VA 22030, OR sent via e-mail to robert.abood@gsa.gov.  

To view current documentation pertaining to this acquisition see FBO Solicitation Number "Reference-Number-022504" for instructions.  Attached to that synopsis is a link to the current version of the Statement of Objectives (SOO) and related documents.    These documents are located within FedTeDS.    For FedTeDS registration information go to    www.fedteds.gov and click on the ”Registering with FedTeDS” link and follow the instructions.    Response to your registration request requires 48 hours.  Note:  The current FBO SOO and related documents are located in FedTeDS, however interested vendors who have registered with FedTeDS must link to FedTeDS through the FBO synopsis number “Reference-Number-022504”.    

NOTE:  Documents in FedTeDS are current as of 2/25/04.  These documents currently in FedTeDS may be revised, updated or deleted, and additional documents may be added.  The next FedTeDS documentation update will coincide with the release of the solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The contractor's proposal (or any part thereof) may be incorporated into the resultant co ntract by reference.  BASIS FOR AWARD:  One of the following three actions will be taken after the evaluation of a submitted concept paper: the offeror will be awarded a firm fixed price contract for the work proposed, the offeror will be asked to clarify or modify the proposal and resubmit, or the offeror will be notified that the CCRP has no interest in undertaking the proposed effort at this time.

Priority consideration will be given to offerors that can demonstrate that the product of the proposed research would be utilized by another DoD organization and/or propose collaborative research efforts that are supported by othe r DoD organizations.  Concept papers will be evaluated based upon:  (1) the contribution of the proposed work to advancing the goals and objectives of the CCRP, (2) the qualifications of the project team, (3) the proposed technical approach and project pla n, and (4) the offeror's past performance.  Although cost is not specifically weighted as such, it will also be considered in the evaluation process in terms of cost realism, and as proposals become more equal in technical merit.

The provisions of DFAR 227.7102-2, Rights in Technical Data, will apply to any resulting contract issued under this BAA.

Anticipated generations are 3.7 million pounds (1.7 million KG) over an 18- month period.

Adequate competition is defined as the receipt of at least two (2) competitive proposals in a tier from companies that are qualified, technically acceptable, cost reasonable and responsible business concerns.

In the event that adequate competition and fair market price requirements cannot be met under the First Tier Competition, and there is only one technically qualified firm offering a fair market price, then competition at this Tier will stop.  The one qualified firm from the First Tier will compete in the Second Tier Competition. Second Tier Competition is defined as competition among eligible small business concerns providing 51% or more of the direct labor dollars proposed for the required contract effort.  If adequate competition and fair market price requirements are met under the Second Tier, competition at the Third Tier will not occur and award will be made at the Second Tier.  In the event that adequate competition and fair market price requirements cannot be met under the Second Tier Competition, and there is only one technically qualified firm offering a fair market price, then competition at this Tier will stop.  The one qualified firm from the Second Tier will compete in the Third Tier Competition.

<CONTACT>Amy Ellis,937.255.2898
<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 002 (27 Feb 04)- One-On-One Questions The following questions are to be addressed during one-on-one meetings with the  Government and potential prime contractors: 1.  What are the main technical/capability differences between your current  production or anticipated design(s) and the aircraft needed to meet PRV ORD  thresholds. At a subsystem level, characterize the technical effort it would  take you to modify your current or anticipated design(s) to (a) a design with  the same capability as the current CSAR aircraft (HH-60G) and (b) a design that  meet all of the thresholds in the PRV ORD. 2.  Using your current production or anticipated design(s) as a technical  starting point, what would be the minimum timeframe, including long lead  procurement, and minimum number of test assets that would be required to  design, integrate, test, ensure adequate production capacity, and produce four  LRIP aircraft in both of the configurations listed above? PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 001 (6 Feb 04)- Industry Day Announcement  The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  SOF-CSAR SPO) will host an Industry Day on 4 March 2004 at the Holiday Inn in  Fairborn, Ohio to inform industry of a new program to develop and procure 132  Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This procurement activity is scheduled to  begin sometime later this year, and will be a very aggressive, quick moving  development program.  This Industry Day will be a one day event where the  program office will brief industry on what the program entails to ensure that  industry has an understanding of the requirements and intent of the PRV  program.    The agenda is being developed at this time.  It will include government  briefings on the program, possible acquisition strategies, operator  requirements and a question and answer session in the morning.  The afternoon  will be reserved for prime contractors to meet one-on-one with government  representatives to ask questions of a proprietary nature and describe their  unique abilities to meet the requirements stated in the operational  requirements document.    Individuals wishing to attend this Industry Day must register online via the  MarketSpace link at the bottom of this page.  This Industry Day is restricted  to United States citizens.  All attendees must present a government issued  photo identification, as well as a birth certificate or U.S. passport for registration on the day of the event.  The Industry Day will be oriented  toward rotary wing prime contractors; contractors who have the ability to  design and manufacture medium lift vertical take-off/landing medium lift class  vehicles.  Suppliers to these prime contractors will also be eligible to  attend.  Contractors who are interested in obtaining a copy of the draft Operational  Requirements Document (ORD) and a draft of the Statement of Objectives (SOO)  may request them by sending an e-mail message to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil. All  requests must include the company name as well as the Commercial and Government  Entity (CAGE) code.  REGISTER FOR PRV INDUSTRY DAY: All individuals planning on attending the PRV Industry Day must register online  through MarketSpace via the link at the bottom of the announcement. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  NO SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.

This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the Air Force to identify interested potential sources capable of providing proven, yet contemporary, approaches to accomplishing B-52 radome testing requirements.  It is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Any resulting procurement action will be the subject of a separate, future announcement.  The following information is provided for discussion purposes and any potential strategy for this acquisition may change prior to any solicitation release.

The Government has the requirement to functionally test the B-52 radomes listed below:

NSN: 1560012568390FG, P/N: 35-30179-604, Nose Radome
NSN: 1560012733145FG, P/N: 35-30355-514, R/H Side Radome
NSN: 1560012733146FG, P/N: 35-30355-509, L/H Side Radome

The current government test facility, located at Building 3507, Tinker AFB, Oklahoma, is antiquated and requires extensive refurbishment or replacement.  The Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center anticipates conducting a B-52 Radome Testing Industry Day to investigate future options for accomplishing this critical testing requirement.  The Air Force is seeking aerospace industry inputs from responsible sources, with demonstrated radome test capabilities, to evaluate the current facility, the B-52 radome test requirements and offer approaches for accomplishing the testing of B-52 radomes to include the refurbishment or replacement of equipment in the existing on-base facility, or the use of off-base commercial facilities.  

Industry Day is scheduled for 9 March 2004 in Building 3001, LH Conference Room, Post 2AH192B, to review the B-52 radome testing requirements and to tour the current Far Field Radar Test Range (FFRTR) facility.  The Government will not reimburse attendees for any costs associated with participation and is under no obligation to award any contract associated with this event. Seating is limited, therefore advance written requests for admittance are required not later than COB 5 March 2004 and each contractor is limited to four (4) representatives.  All attendees must be cleared at DoD SECRET level, in order to participate.  All written responses and visitor clearances should be addressed to Della Wyatt, OC-ALC/PSKCB, (405)739-5797, email at della.wyatt@tinker.af.mil or faxed to (405)739-4452.  Technical information regarding B-52 test requirements will be forwarded upon request.

Upon completion of the Industry Day, interested parties will be given an opportunity to submit questions until COB 15 March 2004.   Answers will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.eps.gov.   Interested parties should provide a brief written response and description of potential approach(s) for accomplishing testing of B-52 Radomes for review by the Government by COB 31 March 2004.  Responses should also include the offerors’ radome testing qualifications, with respect to the key features discussed above, as well as examples of projects where goals similar to those listed above were achieved.

Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to the Sources Sought request.  The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code has not yet been determined and the small business set-aside, if any, has not been determined.

<DESC>The New York District intends to solicit and award a dredging project on the Patchogue River in Patchogue, Long Island, Suffolk County, New York.  The project itself will be solicited competitively under a future solicitation.  Therefore, this notifi cation serves three purposes:  (1) To determine if there are any firms who can not only perform the described task in Ã¢Â€ÂœSUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTÃ¢Â€Â, but who would be interested in contracting for this particular task.  (2) If any firms have suggestion s for Ã¢Â€Âœbeneficial uses of the dredged materialÃ¢Â€Â (optional).  (3) To determine the socio-economic characteristics of the firms that are interested in this task (i.e. large business, small business, small disadvantaged, HubZone, etc.). SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENT:  The objective is to dredge approximately 120,000 cubic yards of sandy silt material from the Patchogue River at Patchogue, Long Island, New York and place the material at a State approved disposal facility. The required timeframe i s between October 2004 and March 2005.  The river has an authorized depth of 8 feet, and extends approximately 2.5 miles inland from the Great South Bay.  The dredging depth would be approximately Ã¢Â€Â“3 feet MLW to approximately Ã¢Â€Â“8 feet MLW.  We wil l likely prescribe dredging to no deeper than Ã¢Â€Â“8 feet MLW.  The material to be dredged is not eligible for placement at the Historic Area Remediation Site (HARS) in the Atlantic Ocean, nor can it be used as beach nourishment due to the grain size dist ribution of the material. There is no known disposal area adjacent to the river that can be used for placement of the material.  Responders must be able to secure all of the required services and provide, in a timely manner, all of the environmental permits necessary for dredging, dewatering, treatment (if required), transportation and placement of the material at a currently availa ble, State approved disposal facility/site for the estimated volume of dredged material, plus amendments as appropriate; and be able to perform the work within a to-be-specified number of days within the timeframe. Beneficial uses of the dredged material a re highly encouraged. The estimate value of this acquisition is between $2-5 Million.   The size standards to determine business size for this project are:  237990- Dredging, General Contractors ($17,000,000).  SIC Code is 1629 (General Construction Contractors). Any vendor wishing to provide services that are consistent with the above descriptions and requirements must provide a copy of its brochure, a statement as to their socio-economic classification, and any suggestions on beneficial use of the dredged materia l (optional) within 14 days after the publication of this notice to:  Alan P. Link, Lead Contract Specialist, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers-New York District, Contracting Division, 26 Federal Plaza-Room 1843, New York NY 10278-0090.  This is a market surve y and notification of intent only.  This is not a request to respond to a solicitation.  This project will be solicited at a future date. Points of contact:  Alan P. Link, Lead Contract Specialist, Telephone (212) 264-6707; FAX (212) 264-3013; Joseph Olha,  Project Manager, Telephone (212) 264-5621.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE INSPECTION TESTER FOR EXPLOSIVES
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE INSPECTION TESTER FOR EXPLOSIVES


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's Inspection Tester for Explosives technology.

Scientists at LLNL have invented an inspection tester for explosives that can be used as a primary screening tool by non-technical personnel to determine whether a surface contains explosives.  The inspection tester can be used virtually anywhere, car and shipping portal checkpoints, airports, first responders, Federal, State, and local Municipal agencies.

It is known that surfaces in contact with explosives (for example, during storage, handling, or device fabrication) will readily become contaminated with explosive particulates as a result of their inherent stickiness.

Cross contamination in which a secondary surface is contaminated by contact with a contaminated primary surface can also readily occur.  Explosive residue will likely persist in large amounts on the explosive packaging and environments, as well as on the individuals involved in building the explosive device, which can provide an avenue for detection of the presence of explosives.

LLNL’s explosives inspection tester uses a simple and rapid method of operation. The sample pad is exposed to a suspect substance by the sample pad being swiped across a surface or the sample pad being exposed to the suspect substance by adding it to the sample pad.  A large number of common military and industrial explosives can be easily detected.

LLNL’s explosives inspection tester has detection limits depending on the type of explosives present.  The chemistry reaction scheme, the types of chemicals, the concentrations, the quantity, and the heat, have been optimized to provide the best results.  The inspection tester is extremely fast, sensitive, very easy to implement.  It is inexpensive and disposable.
 

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's inspection tester for explosives technology should provide a written statement of interest that includes:

1.	Company name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	Description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 67-04.

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest.

This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is small business set-aside procurement.    The NAICS is 721110.
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions.  Therefore, offeror’s initial offer should contain its best terms.

As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.
