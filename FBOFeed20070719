<DESC>NOTIFICATION OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER.  The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Office of Policy, Planning and Budget (OPPB)

The Office of Policy, Planning and Budget (OPPB) is located within SAMHSA?s Office of the Administrator.  The mission of the OPPB is to develop policy recommendations and issues for the Administrator and senior leadership; to manage the coordination of the Agency=s national program policies; to provide Agency leadership and expertise on issues such as alcohol, HIV/AIDS, minority health, and women=s services; to manage the planning and budget formulation processes, the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), grant funding announcement development, extramural policy development functions, the Healthy People 2010 initiative and to provide support for the SAMHSA National Advisory Council, and the Advisory Committee for Women?s Services.

SAMHSA, like all government agencies, is obligated to evaluate its programs to assure that they are achieving the purposes for which they are intended, operating in accordance with legislation and other guidance, and being implemented in an efficient manner.  The Office of Management and Budget expects programs to conduct regular, independent, high quality evaluations, and considers evaluations in scoring programs on the Program Assessment Rating Tool.

SAMHSA has not had a consistent policy on evaluations, and currently responsibility for planning and overseeing evaluations is decentralized throughout the agency.  Recently, the Center for Mental Health Services has drafted an evaluation policy for its programs.  In addition, the agency has identified program evaluation as one of the technical competencies required for public health advisors and analysts.  Staff have identified this as an area in which they would like further instruction.

The evaluation guide is not meant to be a textbook on evaluation.  Rather, it is to be a SAMHSA-specific resource for project officers in deciding what types of evaluations are appropriate for various types of SAMHSA programs; when to initiate steps toward evaluating a program; what the various external constraints are.  It is expected that the product will be developed based on consultation with SAMHSA staff, review of materials supplied by the project officer as well as those available in print and on the Internet, and the Contractor?s expertise. 

Interested parties possessing these required capabilities should submit a cover letter, along with their capability statement, demonstrating the ability to perform all aspects of this requirement.  Responses must include:  the contractor?s name and business address; the name, phone number and e-mail address of a point of contact; the contractor?s Tax Identification Number and DUNS number (so the Government can verify that the firm is registered in the CCR); a list of previous contracts for similar type requirements; and any company literature or brochures that may be relevant.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements or proposals received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Small business concerns (including small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, etc.) are encouraged to review this notice.  E-mail capability statement to bjmiller@psc.gov, referencing the Pre-solicitation Number 07M000127 in the subject.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any requests for solicitation packages will be disregarded.

<DESC>NOTIFICATION OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER.  The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Office of Policy, Planning and Budget (OPPB)

The purpose of this purchase order is to provide assistance and support for the OPPB on various agency-wide extramural policy, planning, and program activities.  This arrangement will enhance the ability of OPPB to address, coordinate, and implement these activities in a timely and effective manner.

Significant changes have been made in the HHS grants policies that govern the operations and management of these programs and to the HHS and SAMHSA grant development and announcement processes.  In response to these extramural program changes, SAMHSA has accelerated the process of updating existing policy documents and developing new guidance.  To ensure consistent implementation, SAMHSA staff must be trained on the policies and related procedures.  In completing this purchase order, the Contractor shall: 

A. Develop SAMHSA Extramural Policy Statements (SEPS):  The documents that convey SAMHSA?s policies and procedures for extramural program and application review activities are referred to as SEPS; the SEPS replaced the agency?s Instruction and Information documents (I&I).  Generally SEPS are internal documents that are posted on the SAMHSA intranet.  Occasionally, the documents include information that must be shared with the public in written form.  In those instances, SEPS are posted on the SAMHSA web site and sometimes published in the Federal Register. The Contractor shall research and develop a SEPS on a topic such as the feasibility of allowing Federal funds designated for infrastructure programs to be used for the provision of services for incarcerated populations.

B. Develop Standard Operating Procedures for Committee Management Work:  SAMHSA and its three Centers administer six advisory Councils/Committees which operate within the legal framework of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA).  The council and committees perform a policy and program advisory role for the Agency and the three Centers.  While each Center is responsible for managing its Councils/Committees, OPPB is responsible for overseeing the management of the six groups.  There are reporting requirements and other responsibilities performed by staff across the agency.  Although staff from OPPB and each of the Centers carry out these activities, OPPB staff are responsible for coordinating and providing guidance on implementation of these cross-cutting projects.  Consistency is critical to successfully carrying out these responsibilities.  OPPB must provide clear standards and procedures with respect to the development, processing, and submission of the documents.  Face-to-face training with SAMHSA staff, in a classroom format, has proven to be an effective way to accomplish this goal.  The Contractor shall develop two SOPs on topics such as chartering/re-chartering National Advisory Councils/Committees and Ethics as related to Council members.

C. Provide Training on Standard Operating Procedures.  Consistent interpretation and implementation of the agency?s operating procedures are essential to fully and successfully implementing the agency?s activities.  The Contractor shall develop a training module from the materials developed under item B above (Develop SOPs) and work with the Project Officer (PO) on preparing and conducting a training session for the SAMHSA staff that are responsible for implementing the procedures. 

Interested parties possessing these required capabilities should submit a cover letter, along with their capability statement, demonstrating the ability to perform all aspects of this requirement.  Responses must include:  the contractor?s name and business address; the name, phone number and e-mail address of a point of contact; the contractor?s Tax Identification Number and DUNS number (so the Government can verify that the firm is registered in the CCR); a list of previous contracts for similar type requirements; and any company literature or brochures that may be relevant.

For purposes of standardizing the infrastructure components of the HR system it is necessary for this equipment to be the Dell brand name. Human Resources strive to maintain a single point of accountability, with common network and systems management tools compatible with current equipment. The existing IT infrastructure has been developed utilizing an architecture based on a Dell sourced platform. To promote an overall lower Total Cost of Ownership, this procurement should be considered incremental to the existing infrastructure. Utilizing Dell for these additional enterprise products and services will provide continuity and single point of contact responsibility for the overall infrastructure.  Having Dell as the single vendor for the entire enterprise mix of servers and storage products, including software, provides a clear escalation path and resolution of all issues to maintain critical systemsThis action is taken in accordance with the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as identified by FAR 6.302-1.<BR><BR>For purposes of standardizing the infrastructure components of the HR system it is necessary for this equipment to be the Dell brand name. 	Dell provides common images and components with its servers platforms  helping to simplify management and cut costs. Dell has spent the last decade building commonality into the server family with the specific goal of simplifying management and maintenance, while reducing cost and complexity.  	ImageWatch  Dell provides a road map of upcoming software changes, allowing HR to better plan updates.  	Block updates  By delivering scheduled changes, Dell can help minimize the number of updates HR makes each year.  	Image commonality  By reducing the number of overall images in the Dell PowerEdge server line, Dell has reduced the time required for image maintenance.  	Component commonality  The Dell PowerEdge Server Family share common components (memory, hard drives, management cards and more), which help improve efficiency during build and servicing.  	Management commonality  Dell PowerEdge Servers are managed through a common interface to help maximize efficiency and streamline management. Dell OpenManage is provided with ALL Dell systems at no extra cost. OpenManage provides one management interface for hardware, software, and operating systems.  	Dell tracks configurations of every product down to the component level, which allows Dell to quickly and easily analyze product performance and take corrective action when needed.  	Dell provides investment protection when migrating to future Blade Server architectures (ie, going from PowerEdge 1855 to PowerEdge 1955).  	Dell advocates use of industry-standard resource management software where competitors are proprietary (customer lock-in) and expensive.  	Human Resources strive to maintain a single point of accountability, with common network and systems management tools compatible with current equipment. The existing IT infrastructure has been developed utilizing an architecture based on a Dell sourced platform. To promote an overall lower Total Cost of Ownership, this procurement should be considered incremental to the existing infrastructure.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice

GSA Great Lakes Region 5 anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the procurement of a telecommunications local Service contract for the entire city of Cincinnati and its metropolitan areas.


Existing Program and Anticipated Replacement

The Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) Information Technology Services (ITS) Network Services Division (NSD) of the General Services Administration (GSA) currently provides local telecommunications services in the Greater Cincinnati Area under a Metropolitan Area Acquisitions (MAA) contract.  

The current MAA contracts offer a broad portfolio of commercial services and products at very competitive prices- including voice, data, video and technical services.  With the contract continuity of service set to expire in 2008, FAS is replacing the local contract with a program known as Cincinnati Local Service (CLS) contract.

Acquisition Strategy

The Government has defined two service groups: voice services and data services, with related technical support and ancillary service enabling devices.  The Government?s approach to the acquisition of these services is as follows:

Voice Services (VS) ? Offeros may propose voice services to be eligible for a CLS award.  Voice services are specified in a functional manner in order to allow Offerors the flexibility to meet voice requirement with either traditional or emerging technologies.  Offerors will have the additional flexibility to determine the extent of service coverage within the CLS service area, Offerors are also encouraged to propose a complementary set of technical support services that enhance their voice service offerings.

Data Service (DS) ? Offerors may propose data services to be eligible for a CLS award.  The Government has specified a required set of data services described herein.  An Offeror shall meet all requirements associated with that service.  Offeros are allowed to the flexibility to meet the data service requirements with emerging technologies.  Offerors are also encouraged to propose a complementary set of technical support services and CPE that enhance their data service offerings. 


Summary of CLS services are as described below ? Offerors will be encouraged to propose additional commercially available services and equipment that enable, enhance, or otherwise extend their service offerings and value to the Government.

CLS services include local access; i.e., the dedicated or switched connection from the Offerors office to the customer?s Service Delivery Point (SDP) and includes transmission.  CLS services include local access and transport, the connections between the Offerors locations serving the originating and terminating SDPs within the CLS service area, and the IXC access, the connection between the CLS network and the IXC?s Point of Presence (POP).  The Offeror shall support IXC access by providing customer organizations the ability to choose the Government-specified Government Designated Interexchange Carrier (GDIXC)/Pre-subscribed Interexchange Carrier (PIC) for long distance services.

<DESC>Electronic procedure will be used for this solicitation.  See Note(s) 22 and 26.                                       CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS 	Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Ogden Air Logistics Center, 984 CBSG/OBS, 6041 Gum Lane, Bldg 1226, Hill AFB, UT, 84056-5824 DESCRIPTION 	Secondary Power Logistics Solution:  The Secondary Power Commodity Council (SPCC), 84th Combat Sustainment Wing, Hill AFB, Utah, intends to award a sole source, non-commercial, firm fixed price with economic price adjustment contract to Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation (HSC) for a services acquisition called Secondary Power Logistics Solution (SPLS) focused on Secondary Power Systems for, but not limited to, the following weapon systems: F-16 and KC-135.  SPLS, a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) concept, incorporates a public-private partnership between the contractor and Depot Maintenance at Hill AFB Utah and NADEP Cherry Point North Carolina.  The cornerstone of PBL is the purchase of weapon system secondary power system sustainment as an affordable, integrated package based on output measures such as material availability and reliability rather than input measures, such as parts, technical services, and repairs.  SPLS is the best strategy for the Air Force to reduce costs and optimize support to the Warfighter.  The maximum contract period for this effort will not exceed 10 years.  The anticipated award date is on or about 04 June 2008.   Justification for Sole Source Acquisition:  The statutory authority applicable to permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) and (iii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation is the current Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), and the only responsible source who owns the necessary design, configuration, manufacturing, production, and process data capable to perform the required significant reliability improvements to the secondary power systems.  Also, the degree of reliability improvements being sought are of a nature that will likely require HSC to be deeply involved in configuration management issues and systems engineering design, i.e. some of the reliability improvements sought will result in significant system design changes, which will require access to original design data and OEM intellectual property.   This effort may also require the contractor to supply newly manufactured major components to meet SPLS requirements.  Subcontracting Opportunities:  All businesses interested in subcontracting opportunities must contact Hamilton Sundstrand Incorporated at 858-627-6981. Solicitation & Technical Data Availability:  Because SPLS is a sole source acquisition, a solicitation will not be available; instead a request for proposal will be issued directly to HSC.  Negotiations shall be conducted using the Integrated Process Team (IPT)/One Pass Pricing process.  HSC is not required to furnish a technical data package to the Supply Chain Management Program Office, and therefore a data package is not available to interested sources to aid in accomplishment of SPLS integration on the above-designated platforms.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. Ombudsman:  AFFARS 53532.201-9101 Ombudsman is applicable.   OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005) (a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). (c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Ms. Julie Primbs at (801) 777-0768, OO-ALC/PKP, 6038 Aspen Avenue, Bldg 1289, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5824. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. (d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  (e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.  (End of clause) POINT OF CONTACT Technical:  Program Manager, Mr. Rick Norman at (801) 586-5525, e-mail rick.norman@hill.af.mil.   Contracting matters:  Procurement Manager, Capt Sheela Casper, (801) 586-7289 e-mail sheela.casper@hill.af.mil or Contracting Officer, Mr. Culley B. Charlesworth at (801) 777-1343, e-mail culley.charlesworth@hill.af.mil.

Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, information received by the response date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government.

Sole Source Justification

AFRL/IFEC has existing DRT systems in use for research and development under in house efforts such as Network Centric Exploitation and Tracking (NCET) and Simulated Communications (SIMCOMM). The new system must interact with the existing equipment due to proprietary software programming and interface logic between the software and hardware. If another system were to be procured for use with the existing DRT software and hardware, the Government would incur an inordinate amount of effort and cost to design and configure software and software to hardware interfaces. Due to the proprietary software and interface mechanisms, to use another brand system would require extensive research, testing, and development to achieve compatibility. The proposed source, Digital Receiving Technology, is the only known source that can manufacture and distribute a wireless receiving system which meets this Government requirement.

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AS CONSTRUCTOR (CMc) SERVICES: The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) services for the construction of the New U.S. Courthouse in Toledo, Ohio. The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the planning, design, and construction phases. The CMc selected for this project shall work along with GSA and GSA's selected A/E firm. The services required of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities, which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs).  The CMc will be responsible for providing the management, quality control, and administrative tasks needed to perform the services in an expeditious and economical manner consistent with the best interests of the Government. The CMc will be at risk and responsible for involvement in the project development and administration of the construction. The CMc shall assist the Government to achieve its goals with respect to the project's schedule, budget, scope and quality. The base contract work will be awarded as a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract and a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) for the construction option.

PROJECT SUMMARY: This project proposes the construction of a new courthouse in Toledo, Ohio. The new 222,751 GSF structure will hold the US District Court, US Marshals, US Attorneys, US Congressional Office, Federal Protective Service, and the General Services Administration. The courthouse will contain 6 US District courtrooms, as well as 57 interior secured parking spaces.  

The site for the new building was acquired through a land exchange agreement with the City of Toledo. The project site is located at intersection of Michigan Street and Cherry Street in Toledo, Ohio 43624. Anchoring the northeast end of Toledo's civic mall the site is approximately 7.453 acres. The site is designated as historic and thus its development must comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The site is bounded on the north by Michigan and Cherry Streets, Spielbusch Avenue to the west, and the City of Toledo properties to the east. Orange Street transects the southern portion of the site.
The estimated price range of this project is between $80 and $100 million dollars.

Once under contract, the CMc will be expected to provide pre-construction services immediately. Pre-construction services will last throughout the entire design phase, currently estimated at 730 calendar days. Design packages developed in conjunction with the CMc will be utilized in the construction option of this project.

PROCEDURES FOR AWARD: Selection of the CMc firm will be competitively chosen in accordance with the federal acquisition regulations and source selection procedures using the Best Value trade-off process. For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. A solicitation will be issued requesting offerors to submit in writing both a technical and a price proposal by the offer due date and time. Responsive offers will be evaluated on technical capability, past performance, and price. The award will be made to the offeror that represents the best value to the Government.

SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION: In accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, this procurement is unrestricted and is therefore open to both large and small business concerns. The small business size standard for NAICS Code 236220 is $31.0 million. Although this procurement is not set aside for small businesses, small firms including women-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, and service disabled veteran-owned business are strongly encouraged to participate in this project. In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract. Each large firm will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA). An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract. Small businesses are not subject to this requirement. However, all firms seeking consideration for this contract will need to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for local business participation.     

JOINT VENTURES: Joint ventures or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality CMc team effort.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: The solicitation package will only be available electronically. It will be available on or about August 10, 2007.

This will be a requirements type contract with one (01) base year and four (04) option years.  The Philadelphia Gear Pumps are utilized on the 378? WHEC Cutters.  This requirement will also include:  (1) the overhaul/repair of model numbers 46123R253,46123R251RH and 46123R252LC.  This will be other than full and open competition using the Philadelphia Gear Company only.

<SUBJECT>B -- Effect of 10 Days of Bed Rest Followed by 60 Days of Rehab on Muscle and Adipose tissue in the Thigh of a Group of Older People

<CONTACT>Patricia Meise, Purchasing Agent, Phone 410-558-8043, Fax 410-558-8319, Email meisep@grc.nia.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with the University of Arkansas for continuation of research to ascertain the effect of 10 days of bed rest followed by 60 days of rehab on muscle and adipose tissue in the thigh of a group of older people and how changes in these tissues correlate with changes in peripheral and central insulin resistance.  It is well known that bed rest is associated with loss of muscle in younger persons and with persons put on bed rest for experimental purposes.  Dr. William Evans and his group at the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences have demonstrated that there is almost double the loss of muscle tissue in older persons compared with younger persons on 10 days of bed rest.  In these protocols, he is obtaining muscle tissue from biopsy and has shown an increase in muscle breakdown greater in older compared to younger persons.  He is using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry to quantify muscle in these protocols.  Use of computerized tomography in these experiments would allow extension of this work to examine the specific effect of bed rest on atrophy of particular muscle groups on change in intermuscular adipose, and on change in muscle attenuation, an indicator of the infiltration of adipose into muscle below the level of resolution needed to define aggregate adipose tissue.  These effects can be correlated to the physiologic measurements already planned for this bed rest experiment, including measures of hepatic glucose uptake and hepatic insulin resistance as well as peripheral insulin resistance and protein synthesis.  In addition, because each participant is being given a 60-day rehabilitation period, we can assess whether the structural changes secondary to bed rest are completely reversed.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1(b) (1).  The cited authority is applicable because the University of Arkansas is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.  Dr. William Evans, Univ of Arkansas, is a world-renowned expert on body composition and metabolism in older people.  He has an NIH-funded Program Project to explore acute changes in body composition in older persons through a series of bed rest studies that he initiated over a year ago.  These are critical studies because they are tightly controller in terms of the physiologic challenge to metabolic homeostasis and are the gold-standard for acute change in body composition.  However, because of the risks associated with this, they are rarely carried out in older persons.  Dr. Evans work is strictly supervised by his IRB and he has provision for rehabilitation after the bed rest.  Unfortunately, there is no imaging component to his project and this creates the opportunity to add investigation of unique and critical data to ongoing studies that could not be replicated.  Thus, sole source is justified because of the scope of the work, the unique opportunity to add measurements to this work and the scientific opportunity this creates, and because of Dr. Evans? unparalleled expertise in this area of research.   The period of performance is 12 months.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 541990 and the size standard is $6.5 million.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.

<SUBJECT>A--FY2008 Non-Lethal Weapons Science and Technology Broad Agency Announcement for Applied Research and Technology Development Efforts
<SOLNBR>M6785407R7075
<RESPDATE>083107
<ARCHDATE>02292008
<CONTACT>Peggy Smith 703.432.0894
<DESC>The Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD) is soliciting proposals for research, development, integration, and demonstration of next-generation non-lethal weapons (NLW).  The objective of this BAA is to stimulate applied research, development, and rapid-prototyping of NLW technologies in an attempt to address known NLW capability gaps. General research focus areas of interest to the JNLWD include technologies to address: 1.	Vehicle/vessel stopping 2.	Extended range and duration personnel incapacitation 3.	Clear a space without entry  4.	NLW effectiveness 5.	Enhanced systems engineering for active denial system operationalization 6.	Multi-sensory stimuli effects characterization  7.	New non-lethal payloads and applications The JNLWD also expresses specific interest in soliciting proposals for research, development, integration, and demonstration of NL payloads and capabilities that would fulfill the requirements of the unattended autonomous non-lethal Intelligent Munition System (IMS). Submissions should specifically describe technology and research objectives designed to accomplish the following: A.  Safely stop or significantly impede the movement of occupied vehicles and/or vessels with minimal collateral damage in support of check-point, convoy protection, maritime defense, and interdiction missions.  Proposed concepts for use in check-point, convoy protection, and maritime defense missions must prevent vehicles/vessels from physically approaching within 100 meters. Proposed concepts for use in interdiction missions must be employable and effective in chase-type scenarios where the targeted vehicle/vessel is fleeing from the chase platform. Additionally, concepts incorporating the following characteristics may receive extra consideration: Vehicle Stopping: 1.	Provide the desired standoff distance (100m) without the need to pre-emplace at the engagement point. 2.	Produce reversible effects allowing the targeted vehicle/vessel to quickly return to an operational condition with minimal time to repair and minimal repair cost. 3.	Low cost per use (<$500 per use). 4.	Lightweight / man portable.  Vessel Stopping: 1.	Safely stop uncooperative vessels, including high-speed planing vessels (i.e., go fast boats), without the need to pre-emplace at the engagement point. 2.	Provide the desired standoff distance (100m). 3.	Provide universal effects for outboard, inboard, inboard/outboard and jet drive propulsion. 4.	Affect vessels up to 40 feet in length. 5.	Deploy from a variety of vessel or aircraft platforms. The JNLWD also desires proposals that incorporate the utilization of vehicle and/or vessel experts capable of conducting susceptibility and forensic analyses on vehicles and/or vessels. Similarly, the JNLWD will consider proposals incorporating outdoor test facilities for prototype test and evaluation of a variety of vehicle/vessel stopping capabilities, including but not limited to RF and combustion modification.  B. Incapacitate humans for extended durations (more than 30 seconds) at operationally relevant ranges. Effects must be entirely reversible and should engage the subject at a minimum of 300-400 meters (beyond small arms range) with precision and accuracy. Non-lethal incapacitation suggests that one cannot:  1.	Accurately shoulder, aim or fire a weapon 2.	Push a button or throw a switch 3.	Easily communicate Candidate technologies could include electro-muscular disruption, various applications of directed energy, or other combined effects (multi-sensory stimuli) technologies, among others.  The JNLWD will also consider complimentary studies that address characterization of related human effects and safety issues, technology miniaturization, or enhanced precision targeting approaches suitable for delivering extended personnel incapacitation effects at range. C.  Clear a space (room, building, or facility) without the necessity for physical entry. Proposed concepts should clear all personnel, combatants and non-combatants, from a space in urban terrain, on vessels, and/or on aircraft in a minimal amount of time. Effects should be temporary and allow for personnel to move from the space under their own power. Additionally, operators should not have to enter the space to initiate the effect. Concepts with considerable standoff (>50m) are preferred, and collateral damage should be minimal. D.  Evaluate non-lethal technologies and weapons for operational utility.  Studies should address qualification and/or quantification of behavioral responses, or other appropriate measures, across the spectrum of non-lethal stimuli as a metric correlated to operational effectiveness.  Key areas may include, but are not limited to, conducting controlled field tests with non-lethal prototypes or weapons in operationally-relevant scenarios, understanding factors influencing NLW effectiveness, and assessing pre-deployment and in-field effectiveness of non-lethal weapons.  The end goal should be to determine the extent to which a non-lethal stimulus, technology, or weapon fulfills user-defined requirements. Another complimentary area of interest is the systematic study for understanding and managing individual and crowd behavior in environments where less than lethal force is an option.  Investigations should focus on behavioral responses to the use of various prototypes and fielded NLWs, to include riot control agents and kinetic, acoustic, and electromagnetic devices.  Knowledge gained should support development of techniques and tools for NLW training, tactical experimentation, and mission planning.   E. Demonstrate an advanced compact millimeter wave source (95GHz) that retains high efficiency at several kilowatts (up to 100kW) in a Gaussian beam. Specific power (including not only the weight of the source, but the weight of any required RF driver system and magnet) should look to improve over the conventional gyrotron/superconducting magnet approach (greater than 125 Watts per pound).  High efficiency of conversion of electrical energy to 95 GHz energy is also important for some of these applications (exceeding 40% at minimum).  Source start-up time should be less than one hour and allow for shoot-on-the-move capability.  Proposals should also include the demonstration of advanced compact peripheral active denial technologies such as: 1.	Innovative mm-wave antenna designs which are compact and lightweight 2.	Thermal management components 3.	Advanced materials, and/or advanced interaction circuits 4.	Advanced power conditioning systems 5.	Other innovative source concepts This includes but is not limited to studies to investigate: 1.	Gyrotron tubes that do not require superconducting magnets (e.g., harmonic generation) or utilize a high-temperature superconducting magnet (e.g. >77K). 2.	Solid-state device structures and circuits that will allow the extension of field plates to mm-wave frequencies.  3.	Innovative power combining approaches (arraying) that make use of materials exploitable for mm-wave sources.  4.	Sources which use electron beams with axis encircling orbits, sheet beams, harmonic operation, and/or multi-stage depression. F.  Conduct a systems engineering analysis of the residual system design from the Active Denial System Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration, to include all subsystems contributing to the current capability.  Provide recommendations that reflect the output of a rigorous cost/benefit approach that achieves a smaller, lighter, less expensive configuration without sacrificing current system effectiveness and performance.  The systems analysis should address all ADS subsystems, with specific attention paid to the following subsystems: 1.	Innovative mm-wave antenna designs which are compact and lightweight 2.	Thermal management components 3.	Advanced materials, and/or advanced interaction circuits 4.	Advanced power conditioning systems 5.	Other innovative source concepts G.  Explore innovative non-lethal technologies employing multi-sensory stimuli through the development and demonstration of prototype systems and accompanying characterization of non-lethal human effects.  Acoustics, coherent and/or incoherent light (including laser and broadband technologies), electromuscular incapacitation, and directed energy are examples of candidate technologies that could be combined into an innovative escalation of force NLW system of systems that could be effectively employed in complex mixed-combatant/noncombatant scenarios.   Additionally, the JNLWD desires to characterize the potential injury associated with the combined effects of multiple non-lethal stimuli applied on target, either concurrently or sequentially. Studies may involve:  1.	Developing dose-response relationships. 2.	Defining safety thresholds or adverse health effects probability curves for non-lethal weapons applications. 3.	Executing or refining injury models for multi-sensory stimuli analysis. H.  Identify and demonstrate the ability of advanced materials or new payloads to provide enhanced non-lethal counter-personnel or counter-material capabilities. Examples of advanced materials and payloads include combustion engine modifiers/inhibitors, rigid foams, anti-traction materials, super adhesives, launchable nets or entangling nets, smart nano-materials, and morphing materials. I. Fulfill requirements of the unattended autonomous non-lethal Intelligent Munition System (IMS) needs as relates to NLW and payloads. General research goals include efforts to: 1.	Non-lethally counter personnel and/or vehicles using the IMS Dispenser Module (DM) as the payload carrier.  The NL payload shall fit within the DM footprint of 24L x 24W x 14.5H.Total volume available is approx 7,390 in3.   2.	Non-lethally counter personnel and/or vehicles using the IMS DM as the control source for a NLW.  NLWs would not be part of the DM footprint but a stand alone effect that receives a fire command from the DM and must interface to the SPIDER Mission Adapter Module (MAM) connection or current Miniature Grenade Launcher DM ports. 3.	For both capabilities described above: counter-vehicle concepts should be effective on civilian-class vehicles. NLWs must be effective in all terrain and allow activation via autonomous/manual means.   J.  Survey state-of-the-art academic research (discovery and invention), and develop applied technology research plans to mitigate known non-lethal capability gaps.  PROGRAM SCOPE:  The scope of this program is intentionally broad to address the wide spectrum of desired operational end-points that the funded investigations will strategically support.  All research is intended to have the common objective of addressing the technology-gaps described above.  Strategically, this research will support the development of a family of next-generation NLWs to meet a broad set of documented NLW requirements and capability gaps.  In addition to the data and technological gaps identified above, research supported by this BAA is intended to enable technology to overcome the current limitations of existing NL systems.  These limitations generally include but are not limited to: 1.	Range, coverage (volume of fire), accuracy, and precision. 2.	Effectiveness and the ability to quantify it. 3.	Providing a universal, repeatable and robust NL effect. 4.	Target safety, particularly across a wide-spectrum of the population. 5.	Deployability, to include weight and volume. 6.	Employability, to include use in complex urban environments. 7.	Military effectiveness and utility in complex operating environments such as within crowds, within rooms and buildings, and within vehicles and vessels. EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria in descending order of importance:  1.	Quality and Technical Merit.  2.	Contributions/Relevance to Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program (JNLWP) and Department of Defense (DoD).  3.	Capabilities, Experience, and Past Performance.  4.	Plans and Capabilities to Accomplish Technology Transfer. 5.	Total Cost and Cost Realism.   (NOTE: Cost realism will be used as an evaluation criterion only in proposals which appear to the reviewers to have significantly under or over estimated the cost to complete the effort).  All awards made in response to this BAA will be subject to availability of government funds. Evaluations and selection or non-selection of proposals for funding will be made on the basis of the evaluation criteria listed and the overall balance considered most advantageous to the JNLWP.  GENERAL INFORMATION:  The JNLWD has available approximately $7 million for FY08 for applied research and advanced technology demonstration science and technology funding and a lesser amount of additional RDT&E funding. Multiple awards typically of 12-36 month duration are anticipated. Offerors should prepare proposals with a baseline period of performance of 12 months and with one or two options each with a 12-month period of performance and with anticipated contract award dates of December 2007. The 12-month baseline or Phase I of the proposal shall have as a minimum two (2) systems or NLWs demonstrations or program evaluation milestones within the first 12 month period of performance so as to provide data/evidence/support for consideration for option year funding.  This BAA will remain open for a period of approximately seven months until through 29 February 2008.  Technical proposals are not to exceed eight pages and must be accompanied by a full cost proposal valid until 31 January 2008 and one QUAD-Chart (the cost proposal and the Quad-Chart are not part of the eight page limit). Format for the Quad chart is provided in the Proposer Information Packet.  Offerors must submit their technical proposal, the Quad-Chart, and their full cost proposal to the administrative address for this BAA in electronic format commensurate with a Microsoft Office software product (e.g., Word, Excel, or PowerPoint).  It is the policy of the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD) to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. Nondisclosure notices notwithstanding, employees of JNLWD and support contractor, American Systems, may handle proposals for administrative and evaluation purposes; however, only Government evaluators will make final selection recommendations under this BAA. This announcement, in conjunction with the pamphlet BAA 08 Proposer Information Package (PIP), constitutes the Broad Agency Announcement as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). Addresses for obtaining the PIP are provided at the end of this notice. A formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement will not be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. In addition, the Government reserves the right to award multiple contracts, grants, or other instruments determined to be of benefit to the government in achieving the goals and objectives of this program.  Awards are subject to the provisions of the FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any other JNLWP and/or Marine Corps contracts through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports and identify the prime contract number. Affirmation shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission. All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in the FAR 9.501, must be disclosed. The disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.  This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit proposals, which will be evaluated. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research related to Non-Lethal Weapons developments.  ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION:  Offerors are required to obtain a pamphlet, BAA 08 Proposer Information Package (PIP) which will be made available to industry through the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program website: https://www.JNLWP.com.

RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet.       (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each suppliers past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs).      (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government.;CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCENAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999)        (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet.      (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each suppliers performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).        (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each suppliers quote having a red or yellow classification for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transpor!  tation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A suppliers FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revised performance data becomes available.      (d) RYG Classifications are summarized as follows:           (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed.           (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective suppliers price to reflect the Governments estimated additional costs.           (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective suppliers price to reflect the Governments estimated additional costs.            (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.      (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment, Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.  FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address.  The request must include the requesters name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.

The Navy helicopters supported by this program are the SH-60B, SH-60F and HH-60H, MH-60S and MH-60R.  The program also includes support of the Coast Guard (HH-60J) and all Navy Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers: Australia, Greece, Spain, Thailand and Taiwan.  Logistic support for the Navy H-60 includes, but is not limited to, material support, inventory management (including shipping, packaging, handling, and transportation), reliability sustainment, engineering support, obsolescence management and technology insertion.  Various gover!  nment approved operational and repair sites will be supported by this effort.  The level of work at DOD repair depots will be maintained in accordance with Title 10 regulations and will not be less than current levels.  Any required notifications will be made prior to award.  The solicitation requires the establishment of separate agreements/partnership for the support of DOD repair depots and to ensure compliance with Title 10 regulations.  Current government approved sources of supply for spares and the repair of repairables will be used for this effort.  Alternate sources may not be used unless written authorization is granted by the PCO.  The Prime Aircraft manufacturer is exempt from this requirement and must use existing procedures for this process.  Performance will commence on and continue for five years with a five year option to extend the contract for a total performance period of ten years.  This requirement will be negotiated with MHSCo (1QPG2) on a sole source!   basis.

This part requires engineering source approval by the       design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing   unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or      knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate      source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification  procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having        jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item         requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is      flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined      adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the          source(s) previously approved by the government for this item have been          solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that  an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an   approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information    detailed in the "https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm" Naval Inventory Control      Point Philadelphia Source Approval Information Brochure. This brochure           identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's       experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you  have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being          evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which   forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to        provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous   submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be      considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a    source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or   approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to    meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue      based on Fleet support needs. The NAVICP Commercial Item Identification Brochure is now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm". -SEE NOTES 9, 22, 26

This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. These items are used to Multi Vehicle Communication System equipments into tactical racks. The slides that were provided with equipments are coated with zinc that will produce gas during fire; therefore, aluminum slides are needed, and the slides are custom made to extend four inches extra for accessibility in maintenance. The slide assemblies have been designed specifically by Jonathan Engineered Solutions to fit in A&J rack with aluminum coating that support th!  e custom equipments of 20VDC power supply, UPS, VME, RF matrix switch, VHF amplifier, 5060 power supply, Router, UPS battery pack, and KVM.  It contains all the required custom interfaces that are used by the program.  A variation to the chassis would cause a slip in schedule and performance of MVCS and the AN/WLD1 Program.

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to award a sole-source extenstion to Ricoh Americas Corporation (Ricoh) pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of the Technical Information and Management Services Branch.  This procurement is to extend the current delivery orders under Contract NAS5-01125 from August 1, 2007 through September 30, 2007 to allow for the completion of the phase-in transition period. The NASA Shared Services Center (NSSC) awarded the follow-on contract, an agency-wide multifunctional device (MFD) services contract, to Xerox Corporation effective May 1, 2007 with a 150-day phase in period from the date of award.  This extension will allow for the continuity of services as well as the successful completion of the phase-in and phase-out period of the successor and incumbent contractor, respectively. Ricoh has provided six years of digital copier services for the Agency.  The expertise and in-depth knowledge acquired by Ricoh over the course of the past six years has been extensive and the services have been tailored to satisfy the requirements of the contract.  Ricoh provides on-site service support, including four-hour response time for service, an electronic database and reports, temporary/short-term support, supplies and accessories, including toner, repairs, training, maintenance, moves and meter readings.  The total number of copiers, which are owned by Ricoh, under all of the delivery orders throughout the agency is 2,376.  During the transition period, Ricoh is resposible for coordinating their phase-out plan with Xerox's phase-in plan, which includes such actions as the hard drive sanitization of the copiers in coordination with NASA IT Security at each of the copier site locations.  No other contractor has access to these copiers for the purposes of Information Technology sanitization to meet our needs.	The tight coordination between Ricoh, Xerox and the Government is critical in an effort to avoid an interruption in service across the Agency.  Due to the necessary phase-in period, Ricoh is considered the only contractor capable of meeting NASA/GSFC's needs given the magnitude of the effort and the short period of performance of the extension. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for one (1) additional Matrox Axio Video Capture and Editing System, which will be used to upgrade KSC's Press Site Webcast Studio (PSWS).  This upgrade consists of the procurement of products manufactured by Matrox and Rorke and the procurement of installation, integration, testing, validation, and extended system support for the additional system.   NASA/KSC intends to purchase the items from Profile East, Inc (PEI), an authorized Matrox service support dealer.  There is no single "off-the-shelf" product capable of meeting NASA/KSC's requirement; these systems utilize software and hardware components from different manufacturers, integrated to perform specialized tasks using expert skills.  It is vital that PSWS personnel retain the use of the same software package across all video capture and editing systems.  PSWS personnel have extensive experience and in-depth knowledge of Adobe Premiere Pro. This requirement requires the integration of components that are certified by Matrox to work with the Axio HD card set.  The Matrox hardware is critical to the production of video content produced for launch, landing, and other special events distributed through the NASA Portal and NASA Direct.  The upgrade will enable the system to be backward compatible with the roughly 4,000 videos previously produced with Adobe Premiere software and Matrox hardware.  It is imperative that the Government have local support, knowledgeable of the integrated equipment and compatibility/integration/upgrade issues, and who can service this system and the three previously procured systems within a timely manner to avoid unacceptable delays on the most visible of NASA's public information websites.  PEI is the only known, local authorized dealer that provides service support for both Matrox and Rorke, two vital components of this equipment.  PEI has prior experience providing integration and testing support to KSC; the company provided KSC's five existing Matrox systems.  Moreover, PEI is able to provide KSC with the timely local support when needed.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 27, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

PROJECT NOTICE

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), a Division of Midwest Research Institute, which is operated under Prime Contract DE-AC36-99GO10337 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), intends to solicit competitive proposals from prequalified sources for a Conceptual Design and Design-Build subcontract for design and construction of a biorefinery production demonstration facility called the Integrated Biorefinery Research Facility (IBRF) project. The IBRF will be located at NRELs South Table Mountain site in Golden, Colorado. The IBRF is envisioned to be the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) and DOE Golden Field Office (GO) signature building at NREL for alternative fuels research and is a high visibility project of national scope. It is intended that the IBRF construction final completion be no later than August 2009. The maximum price for the design-build effort will be negotiated prior to subcontract award and is currently estimated to be approximately $15-17 million, of which approximately $6 million is associated with equipment procurement and installation.  Full funding has been secured for this project.     

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF WORK

The IBRF is for research associated with alternative fuels and the technology transfer to private industry of biochemical and thermochemical conversion processes of plant fiber biomass into ethanol.  To accomplish this, the IBRF design/build shall include a production high bay area that is approximately 40 feet tall with 9600 square feet of floor space with a partial mezzanine and partial basement.  This high bay area will be built adjacent to an existing alternative fuels research facility and will incorporate approximately 15 large items of state of the art equipment and the process design that is associated with ethanol production from biomass. An additional two story structure is envisioned which will be required to house approximately 40 NREL research and administrative staff in approximately 9600 square feet of office space and 5 - 8 laboratories housed in an additional 9600 square foot portion of the facility.   The IBRF is required to be of sustainable high-performance design which demonstrates the integration of high performance building design and practices and utilizes the latest in technology advances.  The IBRF is required to incorporate the best in energy efficiency, environmental performance, and advanced controls using a ?whole building? integrated design approach.  Energy costs shall be at least 30% less than ASHRAE 90.1-2004 baseline equivalent building performance; real time energy use monitoring shall be incorporated into the design to demonstrate these savings.

RFP PROCESS

NREL will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP), to a maximum of three prequalified firms (see Prequalification Process below) that submit a comprehensive proposal inclusive of an architectural concept with drawings/schedule/technical proposal/price and other pertinent information as detailed in the RFP. Subject to DOE approval, NREL anticipates the following elements in the RFP process: 1) prequalification of firms and short-list to three firms, 2) a group meeting with the three firms to discuss performance requirements of the project prior to issuance of the RFP, 3) possibility of results of the group meeting to be incorporated into the RFP Statement of Work, 4) individual meetings with each of the three firms prior to proposal due date, 5) oral presentations of proposals, and 6) stipends to the two unsuccessful offerors. A single offeror will be selected for award based on a best value evaluation of proposals received in response to the RFP.  All three submittals shall be the property of NREL for possible incorporation of elements in the design and construction of the IBRF.

PREQUALIFICATION PROCESS

NREL has determined that design/build firms must be prequalified to submit a proposal for this project.  Prequalification will be determined by NRELs review of the submitted information, in accordance with the technical criteria provided below.  NREL will establish a short list of three firms determined to be most qualified to perform the project successfully. Prequalification submittals must address the following criteria:

A) Demonstrated expertise to integrate environment, safety and health into the design and construction of production facilities and processes similar to biorefineries (i.e., biotechnical and/or chemical pilot plants), with combined laboratory and office space.  Provide a minimum of five references from previous clients demonstrating the integration of safe design, construction and operation, and further demonstration of how safety and compliance issues were better than industry standards at project completion.

B) Demonstrated expertise to design and construct a process demonstration production area with associated equipment, ensuring that the design provides the flexibility to meet the needs of a changing environment such as the research requirements of a national laboratory.  Provide examples from previous clients demonstrating compliance to workforce needs.

C) Demonstrated expertise using an integrated approach for successful completion of design-build projects or projects with a similar acquisition approach. Provide a minimum of five references from previous clients demonstrating successful completion of design-build or similar endeavors.

D) Demonstrated ability to complete design-build projects within original schedule and budget.  Demonstrate how effective project management practices were incorporated into past projects to ensure effective schedule and cost controls and to manage project risk.

E) Demonstrated ability to collaborate with and incorporate ideas from diverse expert sources.  Provide examples from previous projects demonstrating collaboration and incorporation of ideas from diverse expert sources. Biotechnical or chemical facility construction and/or operation expertise shall be demonstrated, credentials of the appropriate personnel shall be supplied as part of the submittal.

F) A methodology to provide regional knowledge and expertise in such areas as local codes, water laws, and local climate.

G) Demonstrated expertise to design to energy goals.  Provide examples from previous clients demonstrating integrated energy strategies, such as the US Green Buildings Council LEED rating system.

H) Demonstrated capability to develop an architectural image that is contextually appropriate with the existing building (Alternative Fuel Users Facility) that the IBRF will be associated with, the site's natural environment, and the owner?s identity to showcase energy efficiency and renewable energy technology.  Provide examples from previous clients demonstrating capability.

Criterion A, B, C and D above are rated equal in value; and Criterion E, F, G and H are rated equal in value.  However, Criterion A, B, C and D are rated higher than E, F, G and H.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a sole source procurement IAW FAR 6.302-1 and 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1).  An approved justification and approval is on file in Contracting Division.  The Huntington District intends to negotiate a contract with Evans, Mechwart, Hambleton & Tilton  (EMH&T) to complete portions of the Mason Run Watershed (Whitehall) Special Study.  A storm water improvement study for the Mason Run Watershed was completed by EMH&T in June 2006 under the Section 594 Environmental Infrastructure program.  In this study,  EMH&T refined the hydraulic and hydrologic models for the entire watershed and also determined the locations within the watershed where the flows were contributing to flooding in the city of Whitehall.  The majority of the emphasis for this work will be a  continuance of the Hydrological and Hydraulic modeling of the Mason Run Watershed.  EMH&T will be asked to develop different flood reduction measures focusing primarily on detention within the watershed and will be required to work closely with the City o f Whitehall, Columbus, Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC) and the Columbus Airport Authority.  The planning portion of the study will be completed primarily by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; however most of the engineering analysis and a significant portion of the coordination with local interests will be completed by the contractor. For further information regarding this announcement, contact Richard D. Horton at (304) 399-5623 or Cheryl D. Brunty at (304) 399-5006.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)Protected Species Division  located in Honolulu, HI intends to acquire services to facilitate the  further development of the Pipin Photo-ID catalog of spinner dolphins in the Pacific Islands Region by coordinating the integration and processing of available photo archives. The period of performance is September 1, 2007  -  August 31, 2008.
Background
The Pacific Islands Photo-Identification Network (PIPIN) was initiated by a U.S.
Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) grant to the cetacean research program at the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) in Honolulu. The funding was directed to support a collaborative photo-identification (photo-ID) catalog that will integrate the efforts of various researchers conducting photo-ID studies on spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris), and other species, in the waters of the Pacific Islands Region (PIR).

An original goal of the PIPIN project was to develop a community-based network of researchers, ideally hosted by a local non-profit in Hawai?i. To accomplish this, and to further develop the PIPIN photo-ID catalog, funds are available to support a local non-profit to facilitate the data processing and integration tasks necessary to incorporate existing datasets into the PIPIN database.

Purpose of project
To facilitate the further development of the PIPIN photo-ID catalog of spinner dolphins in the PIR by coordinating the integration and processing of available photo archives. This will be conducted by the contracting organization through a competitive Request for Proposals (RFP) open to researchers studying spinner dolphins in Hawai?i and the disbursement of funds to awardees. The procedure for awarding funds will be guided by the current PIPIN steering committee.

Evaluation Criteria
Choice of non-profit contractor will be based on 3 criteria, (1) proven track record dealing with digital archives of cetacean photos, (2) non-profit must be located in Hawai?i to maintain strong local support for the PIPIN project and (3) evaluation of administrative costs for completing the task.

Deliverables
The contracting non-profit will provide an RFP for photo data processing and database integration projects and will complete the disbursement of funds by March 1, 2008. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located in La Jolla, CA intends to acquire Sea Turtle - Fisheries bycatch reduction in Chile . The period of performance is from date of award through February 2008. The intended acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41 USC 234 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source. The known source is Ong Pacifico Laud.

Pacifico Laud will carry out objectives outlined under the US-Chile Fisheries Cooperation Agreement, coordinated by the Sub Secretaria de Pesca de Chile.  Objectives are to 1) quantifying sea turtle bycatch in a) pelagic longline fisheries and b) artisanal coastal driftnet fisheries off Chile 2) Gear experiments to test efficacy of circle hooks and bait types in reducing sea turtle bycatch

Bycatch:
Pacifico Laud will coordinate training and place observers on as many commercial longline vessels as funding allows (minimum 50% of fleet) to collect data on sea turtle bycatch.  Observers and fishers will be trained to implement procedures to reduce mortality resulting from bycatch, including resuscitation of comatose turtles and use of line-cutters to free entangled leatherbacks.  Biological samples will be collected and sent to NMFS for genetic and other laboratory analysis.  Pacifico Laud will also evaluate sea turtle bycatch in artisanal driftnet fisheries, and conduct outreach to reduce sea turtle mortality.  Port surveys will be conducted to quantify fishing effort and bycatch through collaboration with a network of fishers who will be trained to identify sea turtle species, collect samples and document (photograph) turtles encountered.  Chilean observers and/or scientists will attach satellite transmitters to loggerhead and leatherback turtles.  NMFS will provide capacity building, flipper tags and applicators, satellite transmitters, and genetic sampling kits.

Gear Experiments:
Pacifico Laud will conduct experiments to test the effects of using circle hooks and mackerel-type bait on catch of swordfish and sea turtles.  Experiments will be based on those conducted by NMFS in the Atlantic longline fishery, which have shown that use of 18/0 circle hooks and mackerel bait are effective at reducing bycatch of sea turtles without affecting swordfish catch.  Experimental design will be coordinated with NMFS scientists.  Hooks will be provided by NMFS.  

Strandings
Pacifico Laud will collect information on sea turtle strandings and samples for genetic and other samples which will be sent to NMFS.



Products
Experimental design and data analysis will be coordinated with NMFS.   A final report will provide estimates of effort by different fisheries, and bycatch rates for different sea turtle species.  Report will also describe abundance and distribution in fishery bycatch, strandings and sightings.  Electronic copies of data will be provided to NMFS.  Samples from turtle strandings and bycatch will be sent to NMFS periodically throughout the contract period.

Train observers and place on longline vessels		monthly August 2007 ? Dec 2007

Outreach/bycatch assess in artisanal fisheries		September ? Dec 2007

Final report					

This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The government reserves the right to solicit offers based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice, or issue a contract to Ong Pacifico Laud without further notice.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service located in Honolulu, HI requires service to develop and test less dangerous weights for use on longline fishery branch lines to increase bycatch-reducing practices.
Project Background:
 Line-weighting to prevent mortality of seabirds is mandatory in the U.S. Pacific longline fishery, and is becoming one of the several options available to fishermen to meet bycatch conservation measures in internationally-managed longline fisheries.  Weighting lines increases the sinking rate of baited hooks, and reduces the window of opportunity for seabirds to interact with hooks near the surface of the water.  Weighting lines also causes them to remain generally deeper in the water, catching fewer shallow-swimming species such as sea turtles, marlins, wahoo, and other gamefish.  Research on turtle-safe fishing gear (circle hooks and alternate bait) has led to reopening of the shallow-set U.S. fishery that traditionally interacted most with seabirds. Thus gear improvements addressing one bycatch problem again have the potential to lead to increased problems with other species.  When using weighted lines, fishermen are at risk of personal injury when lines break under tension thus causing the line weight to return towards the fishermen with great velocity.  Many fishers are not likely to willingly adopt such measures given the risks involved. Yet line weighting is among the single most effective measures among the suite of options available to reduce seabird mortality in longline fishing.  The currently required method of line weighting requires attachment of at least 45 g of weight to branch lines within 1 m of the baited hook.  What is needed is the development of a means to weight baited branch lines so they sink at least as rapidly as with the present method while reducing the human-risk factor. The appropriate weighting method should both safeguard fishers from injury and also increase the likelihood of more widespread acceptance of branch line weighting in longline fisheries.

The objective of this project is to develop and demonstrate a practical, safe, and inexpensive weighting device to sink baited hooks at least as well as the current method, while simultaneously reducing the human risk factor. The final report must include specifications on this device so that it may be manufactured or procured.   Additionally, the report must include summarized data indicating results of field trials, including information addressing improved human safety using the modified weighting device. 

 General Requirements for an offer:

Previous experience in fisheries bycatch mitigation research, as proven by authorship of peer-review articles.
This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located in La Jolla , CA intends to charter a boat to conduct rockfish survey in California . The period of performance is from September 1, 2007 through December 31, 2008. The intended acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41 USC 234 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source. The known source is Outer Limit Sport Fishing. The project specific mounting poles and hull mounts for transducers are required, the R/V Outer Limits has mounting poles and hull mounts installed.

Background:

  This contract will serve two projects.  The first will implement acoustic and ROV survey techniques for rockfish on hard bottom habitat.  This project will improve species composition data for use in monitoring the recovery of bocaccio, cowcod and other depressed rockfish species.  We will use a chartered vessel (M/V Outer Limits) to augment data obtained on NOAA David Starr Jordan  ROV video observations will be used to ground truth habitat type and species composition.  

These objectives will address the ?increased monitoring of marine reserves and other areas of restricted fishing in order to gain information on current reserves that might be applicable to other species in other areas? requested by PSMFC.  They will also contribute new data to the cowcod assessment which is currently managed as a data poor species under Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Management Act.  The most recent stock assessment indicated that direct non lethal surveys are required to monitor the recovery of cowcod, Sebastes levis, in the Cowcod Conservation Area.

White abalone is listed as endangered under ESA and the National Marine Fisheries Service is responsible for monitoring wild populations.  The second  project will survey remaining populations of white abalone in California.

This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The government reserves the right to solicit offers based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice, or issue a contract to Outer Limit Sport Fishing without further notice. All interested parties must respond to this announcement within fifteen (15) calendar days of its publication.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to respond to questions received.  Another modification addressing additional questions is forthcoming.  

Q1. Does NIEHS plan to maintain the position of Managing Editor at NIEHS? 

A1.Yes

Q2. Task 8.1, Copyediting and Proofreading. Is NIEHS considering managing these tasks in-house, with NIEHS staff? Unless notified otherwise, we will assume for the purpose of our proposal that copyediting and proofreading services are required for the journal and that these services will be managed by the contractor.

A2. The provisions of the RFP are for supplementary copyediting and proofreading to support overflow from government staffs' current duties.

Q3. Task 8.3, Special Issues. As stated in the PWS, direct printing costs for these issues have been paid by the issue organizer. Should we plan to include in our Business Proposal our staff costs for managing the production of these issues? 

A3. Yes

Q4. What are NIEHS's plans regarding the Chinese edition? It is mentioned in the PWS that the EHP web site currently hosts this edition.

The existing IT infrastructure has been developed utilizing an architecture based on a Dell sourced platform. To promote an overall lower Total Cost of Ownership, this procurement should be considered incremental to the existing infrastructure. Utilizing Dell for these additional enterprise products and services will provide continuity and single point of contact responsibility for the overall infrastructure.

The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as identified by FAR 6.302-1.<BR><BR>For purposes of standardizing the infrastructure components of the HR system it is necessary for this equipment to be the Dell brand name. 	Dell provides common images and components with its servers platforms  helping to simplify management and cut costs. Dell has spent the last decade building commonality into the server family with the specific goal of simplifying management and maintenance, while reducing cost and complexity.  	ImageWatch  Dell provides a road map of upcoming software changes, allowing HR to better plan updates.  	Block updates  By delivering scheduled changes, Dell can help minimize the number of updates HR makes each year.  	Image commonality  By reducing the number of overall images in the Dell PowerEdge server line, Dell has reduced the time required for image maintenance.  	Component commonality  The Dell PowerEdge Server Family share common components (memory, hard drives, management cards and more), which help improve efficiency during build and servicing.  	Management commonality  Dell PowerEdge Servers are managed through a common interface to help maximize efficiency and streamline management. Dell OpenManage is provided with ALL Dell systems at no extra cost. OpenManage provides one management interface for hardware, software, and operating systems.  	Dell tracks configurations of every product down to the component level, which allows Dell to quickly and easily analyze product performance and take corrective action when needed.  	Dell provides investment protection when migrating to future Blade Server architectures (ie, going from PowerEdge 1855 to PowerEdge 1955).  	Dell advocates use of industry-standard resource management software where competitors are proprietary (customer lock-in) and expensive.  	Human Resources strive to maintain a single point of accountability, with common network and systems management tools compatible with current equipment.

<DESC>Background

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is a small nonpartisan agency that provides economic and budgetary analysis to the Congress to aid in policy decisions. The agency is seeking contracts with experienced writers to prepare issue briefs and other documents.  Awards to multiple individuals to prepare one or more briefs each are anticipated over a 12-month period based on a firm-fixed job rate.  The agency may, at its option, contract with one or more individuals for additional briefs based on performance under the initial contracts.  Contract services shall include but are not limited to summarizing or drawing information from one or more full-length publications and sources to produce stand-alone documents, known as "issue briefs," which are clearly written, accessible, and aimed particularly at a broad audience--including Members of Congress, Congressional staff, and members of the public. The work will require independent judgment and initiative but will include collaboration with the agency's analysts, editors, and managers.  This collaboration will take place on-site.  Therefore, while most of the work will be done off-site, the individual will be expected to meet with CBO staff in their Washington, DC, offices.  Contract prices will be negotiated on the basis of the complexity of the original publication(s) on which the brief will be based.  Travel expenses are not allowed under this agreement.

GENERAL:  This section covers the requirements for the management of ?hazardous waste,? as defined herein, seized by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), or seized by state or local law enforcement agencies and authorized by DEA for removal from domestic clandestine drug laboratories, DEA?s Forensic Laboratories, DEA?s Office of Training, and other waste-generating activities authorized by DEA.   

CONTRACT AREA:
Nevada (08-06) (09-06) 
Utah (13-06)

OBJECTIVE 
The objective of this contract is to secure the services of a hazardous waste removal/disposal Contractor who is qualified to perform the "duties of a generator" of hazardous waste on behalf of law enforcement agencies, and to properly manage the hazardous waste seized by law enforcement at clandestine drug laboratories, generated by forensic laboratories, mobile laboratories, training exercises, or by other waste-generating activities authorized by DEA. 
Waste management, including disposal and a certificate of said disposal, shall be in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local regulations. All on-site work shall be conducted with the appropriate level of personal protection equipment including OSHA Levels A through D and Confined Space Entry, as defined by 29 CFR.  DEA, and therefore the Contractor, is not responsible for the remedial cleanup and disposal of residual waste (e.g., contaminated soil, septic tanks, appliances, structure interiors, etc.), which may remain after the removal of gross contamination.  There is no funding authorization under this contract for cleanup and disposal of residual waste 

Remedial cleanup does not include the removal of contaminated property except that the Contractor may be directed by the DEA Representative to remove contaminated property that constitutes a law enforcement concern (e.g., inextricably contaminated with a controlled substance), including any equipment or containers subject to forfeiture that the DEA Representative directs the Contractor to remove because it cannot be separated safely from any dangerous, toxic, or hazardous raw materials or products. Otherwise, this contract does not authorize payment for disposal of such items removed from the authorized removal site.  The Contractor shall advise the law enforcement officer in charge at the authorized removal site if the Contractor believes any item identified for removal is not allowed under this contract.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  No paper copies of this notice will be provided.

Solicitation Number F4FBFM7156A001 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  

This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-17.  This RFQ is being conducted as a commercial item procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures (FAR Part 13).

NOTICE:  This RFQ is unrestricted.  All businesses capable meeting the minimum requirements, delivery, and regulatory requirements are encouraged to respond.
 
This RFQ has one line item, a Tribometer.  General application of the unit is to test both liquid and solid lubricants in support of Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Advanced Coatings Technology and Survivability program.  Requirements of the tribometer are as stated: 

The tribometer and its associated testing process (methods of test) involve the controlled manipulation of a ball-on-disc contact (of a particular aircraft-quality steel or other material) in such a way that rolling/sliding/skew is introduced into the contact in order to simulate gear contact with another gear, or bearing contact with its raceway.  The process has multiple capabilities to change the rolling (or entraining) and
sliding velocities independently, in infinite ratios to simulate lubricant performance under any condition. The type of testing AFRL/MLBT needs to conduct is dependant on the following parameters:

Motor speed for the ball must be controllable from 0 to 16,000 RPM, and motor speed for the corresponding disc must also be controllable from 0-8,000 RPM. Changing the ball and disc speeds allows customization of the test.  Different lubrication applications require different speeds at the contact point. 

The base temperature range of the instrument must be 25 degrees C to 350 degrees C, but must have the ability to be fitted with a cryogenic chamber which would mean operating temperatures as low as -200 degrees C.  Also, there should be a high temperature package available to increase the temperature range to 800 degrees C. 

The maximum load needed is 1000N with ball tilt angles of +/- 22.5 degrees.  The test chamber must have the ability to be humidity controlled with at least <10% relative humidity in the test environment.  Lubricants that must perform in high load environments must be tested at high loads.  Perfluorinated lubricants are notorious for testing differently in humid environments versus dry environments. Humidity control is crucial to test repeatability for perfluorinated lubricants. 

Training and software to run the tribometer should also be included.

Delivery is required within 11 months from date of contract award.  The System shall be fully functional and stand-alone; delivered to AFRL/MLBT 2941 Hobson Way Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7750.  FOB point is Destination (Wright-Patterson AFB OH).  Quoted prices must be delivered (FOB Destination) prices.  

Evaluation will be based on overall best value.  The binary evaluation factors are price, technical experience, past performance, and delivery time.  Quotations shall address the evaluation factors listed and include the minimum requirements set forth for the Tribometer.  The Government shall make a complete evaluation and appraisal of the offering with regard to understanding of the requirements.  Specifications of component parts including the manufacturer name and model number shall be stated in quote.  All information identified in the quote must be reasonably available to the Contracting Officer.  THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR LOCATING OR OBTAINING ANY INFORMATION NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE QUOTE.

Registration may be accomplished  at http://www.ccr2000.com/index.cfm, or 1-888-CCR-2423 Fax:  1-703-696-0213. SCOPE OF WORK:  This project renovates the interior and installs fire  suppression that doesnt currently exist.  It includes complete  replacement of the HVAC and electrical systems.  The fire alarm is so  outdated it cannot be repaired and requires replacement.  The requirement  for fire suppression/detection carries an FSD 3.  The renovation will  correct life safety deficiencies such as a conference room with inadequate  egress.  The project will reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient  use of space. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: No fire suppression currently exists and  fire alarms are unreliable.  Work is necessary to bring the Wing  Headquarters building into compliance with Life Safety Code, Handicapped  Access and to reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient use of space.  HVAC and electrical systems require revitalization due to age and addition  of ADP equipment.  HVAC has failed on several occasions requiring  temporary heaters and A/C to be brought in until repairs could be made.  The system has been repaired several times but is not expected to be  reliable in the future.  The mechanical system will remain in operation to  serve the first floor.  The first floor will remain occupied by the Wing  Command Section and ASC/JA during construction.  This will require the  contractor to provide temporary rigging for the demolition and material  delivery.  All first floor accesses will have to be maintained during the  construction.  There will be numerous occasions where the contractor will  need to stop performing work to accommodate special events and  distinguished visitors. NOTES: 1.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to award a sole-source contract to MTC Services Corporation, 344 F St STE 202, Chula Vista, CA 91910-2646 for the implementation and support services for the Marine Corps Architecture Tool (MCAT).  The justification for the proposed award is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  The implementation of the MCAT requires that the current MCISR-E Architecture Tool (MAT) be installed and configured to work within the MARCORSYSCOM global environment.  The current MAT program provides architecture development, configuration management, Information Assurance Vulnerability Assessment management, and analysis capabilities.  MTC Services Corporation is the only responsible source who can implement and support the MCAT.    MTC Services Corporation is uniquely qualified because they are the only developer of this software and can p!  rovide the necessary training, technical consulting, and technical support services.   NOTE:  The period of performance and acquisition value for this requirement has been modified.  The base contract will have a period of performance of May 2007 through May 2008, with an additional option year for support services.  The estimated value of the acquisition, inclusive of all options, is $105K. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within seven (7) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Evidence must be provided of your ability to perform the required services.  Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  Inquiries will only be accepted via e-mail to  sakeena.siddiqi@usmc.mil.

<CONTACT>Sharon Middleton
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), code 5600, has been tasked to provide support of support of at sea testing of FSF-1 SEAFIGHTER (X-Craft) has created a requirement for technical and engineering support services.  NSWCCD intends to negotiate a competitive procurement with vendors. This is a non-recurring engineering service for purchase of three Model PF-1U-16FA-HP4F/LP4FP-Z-M103, 16-channel Filter Amplifier systems with power supply Control and GUL. The PF-1U-16FA is a 16-channel filter/amplifier and the PF1U-8FA filter/amplifier is an 8-channel both offering a choice of either 4 or -pole low-pass filters or 8-pole band pass filters. Cutoff settings from 1 H to 204.6 kHz are supported. Throw- class filters may operate in either a 93 94 mode for maximally flat pass-band amplitude response with sharp roll-off or in a 93 pulse 94 mode for low phase distortion and optimized transient response. The 93 flat 94 mode provides pass-band characteris!  tics nearly identical to a Butterworth filter while providing a much sharper roll-off. This mo de is a good choice for applications such as spectral analysis. The 93 pulse 94 mode has time Domain response similar to the Bessel filter yet provides superior amplitude response characteristics. The 93 pulse 94 mode is ideal for time domain applications including transient (shock) measurements and time domain wave form analysis. Programmable pre- and post-filter amplifiers provide an overall gain of 2048. Gain is distributed both before and after the filter to provide protection from large out-of-band energy or transients that could cause clipping before the filter, distorting the data. The post-filter gain has resolution of better than 0.05% to enable system scaling of the outputs to match the full-scale input of the external recording device. Overload detectors alert the user to over-voltage conditions. Precise, automated digital calibration of gain and DC offset are provided. Other features of the PF-1U-FA include a test input for injection of calibration signals into the channel input and a monitor output that allows for convenient monitoring of any channel out!  put via a single BNC. The system includes an Ethernet remote interface and is supplied with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for local control. Non-Recurring Engineering for M103 Modification  M103 modification replaces the 4 poles HP filter with a single pole HP filter cutoffs between 1 HZ and 100 kHz. Interested person may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not request for competitive proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all responsible sources submitting proposals within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive pr!  ocurement.  Anticipated award date is on or around 7/24/07.  Intereste d parties may forward capabilities statements to the point of contract by no later than 07/25/07

<DESC>---This modification is to change the name of the manufacturer to ICX Radiation,  100 Midland Road, Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37830.  The government recends the name Thermo Scientific as the manufacturer. ---
 The government intends to negotiate a Firm Fixed Price type purchase order for material in accordance with FAR part 13.5 (Clinger-Cohen), for Explosive Ordinance Disposal Mobile Unit Eight (EODMU8) in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The material is required for EODMU8 to provide for the safety of the forward deployed units of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Thermo?s Identifinder is a lightweight hand held device used to identify isotopes when radiation is present or suspected.  It captures a spectrum which is immediately compared to its internal library of isotopes for instantaneous computer interpretation of the isotopes present.  The spectrum is then downloaded and transmitted to Subject Matter Experts (SME) at the Department of Energy (DOE) for further analysis.  This acquisition is in direct support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  The Government?s minimum needs have been verified by Certifying technical and requirements personnel.  This requirement is for items solely manufactured by Thermo Scientific.  The IdentiFinder, p/n IDF-EODKIT, is a patented unit and therefore is only available through Thermo Scientific.  Thermo Scientific, 27 Forge Pky, Franklin, MA 02038, is also the only know source of supply for this unit.  Substitutes in brand name would not be feasible because this is a technical unit requiring extensive training in the operation and is already in use in the field by other EOD units.  
The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519.  A complete RFQ package will be available on or about 9 JULY, 2007.  All responsible sources must submit pricing and past performance data by 3:00 p.m. on the date the offer is due.  Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www.fedizopps.gov.  This office no longer issues hardcopy solicitations.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to other than price with the offerors at anytime prior to award.  By submitting a proposal, the offeror will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal Agency.  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the proposal.  By submission of a proposal, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside of the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://ccr.gov.

The Government reserves the right to award contracts, based on the selection board's final selection list, in order of preference, to the firms considered most highly qualified to perform the work.  Each selected firm shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for task orders to be issued.  The Government will use such factors as experience, past performance, quality of deliverables, timeliness, or other factors that the Contracting Officer, in the exercise of sound business judgment, believes are relevant to the placement of orders.  With prior approval of the Contracting Officer assigned responsibility for administration of the contract, any duly authorized Contracting Officer assigned to the National Park Service can place task orders, approve payments, and authorize modifications to task orders issued under the contract. Task Orders may be placed by other Federal agencies, provided an Interagency Agreement or Memorandum of Understanding authorizing such use exists between the National Park Service and the Federal agency requesting the services.  Use of this contract by other Federal agencies must be approved in advance by the Contracting Officer assigned responsibility for administration of this contract.  The task orders issued by other Federal agencies must be in accordance with the requirements, terms, conditions, and within the scope and intent of this contract.     CONTRACT PERIOD The base contract period will be for one year with options to extend for four additional one-year periods. Work will be ordered by issuance of firm fixed price or not-to-exceed type task orders.  The maximum ordering limitation during the life of the contract, which includes the base year and all options exercised, will be $5,000,000.00. The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercised, is $25,000.00.  TYPES OF PROJECTS Types of seismic and structural engineering projects may include, but are not limited to, facilities such as visitor/interpretive centers, administrative facilities, maintenance facilities, and single and multi-family housing; historic buildings/structures which require special treatment and compliance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Structures. Other projects may involve, but are not limited to, the stabilization, preservation, restoration, and rehabilitation of historic structures; renovations and additions to existing buildings; and new facilities. SUSTAINABLE DESIGN The U. S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for planning and development.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.  In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operation of Government facilities.  PRIMARY SERVICES REQUIRED For the purpose of this contract, the seismic and structural engineering services to be provided will be primarily pre-design, design, construction documents, supplemental, and construction management. Services in these categories may include the preparation of pre-design and schematic design documents as well as construction documents for the rehabilitation of facilities and /or new construction. This may involve project scoping and programming; building/structure investigation and evaluation; material/system testing and analysis; rapid visual screening of buildings for potential hazards in accordance with FEMA 154; seismic evaluation of existing buildings in accordance with ASCE 31; seismic rehabilitation design in accordance with FEMA 356/ASCE 41; blast resistant assessment of existing facilities and design of buildings and other structures to resist blast forces and other extreme loading; design analysis and life cycle/value analysis; outline specifications; preliminary and detailed cost estimates; preparation of plans and specifications for bidding purposes; value engineering; and other associated design services related to seismic and structural engineering projects. A documented internal quality control program shall be applied to all services as referenced above. Construction services include answering requests for clarifications, review of submittals, producing documents for any construction contract modifications, inspections, material tests and any other actions required to complete the proposed facility including the warranty period.  COORDINATION The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants.  The A/E will need to have direct contact with federal, state or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes and policies.  SUBCONSULTANT SERVICES In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the Denver Service Center, the DSC occasionally needs to obtain services from subconsultants under the prime contract.  In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor.  Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, DSC will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor.  Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass-throughs" would have on the cap.  This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s).  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the Denver Service Center will continue to acquire such services.  The DSC does not intend to allow the prime consultant an administrative handling or coordination fee on subconsultant's services.   REQUIRED DISCIPLINES Seismic and structural design/engineering and documentation services; and other disciplines may be required in the performance of a specific task order such as historical and general architectural design/documentation services, cost estimating, CADD drafting and incidental services, e.g. word processing, etc. may be required in the performance of specific task order requirements.  In addition, removal of building finishes, destructive testing, foundation testing, etc., may be required to determine actual site conditions. Restoration of surfaces (plaster/drywall repair, backfill, etc.) may be required to keep facilities operational.  TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee of NPS personnel based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance: 1.	demonstrated past performance records showing specialized experience and technical competence in type of work required under this contract, particularly those that involve seismic evaluations and rehabilitation of existing and historic structures; specific past performance records on previous architect/engineering existing building and historic structure work performed for federal, state, and local government agencies, and private industry;  2.	professional  qualifications of individuals listed to perform under the contract, including individual licenses and experience in the work proposed; experience with projects located in geographic areas involving either high seismic forces, severe wind conditions, or heavy snow load environments; involvement in the development and revision of seismic and structural codes, guidelines, and standards; 3.	demonstration of the quality and effectiveness of the firm's work and quality review and assurance procedures, include examples of quality control process records demonstrating effectiveness of firm's procedures; 4.	demonstration of the firm's history of meeting performance schedules and budgets; capacity to respond to expanded or multiple task orders on short notice and within the established schedules, while maintaining a high standard of quality and controlling costs; 5.	demonstrated experience and technical competence in preparing, developing, and finalizing designs for facilities that minimize the use of, and the environmental impact on, the earth's renewable and non-renewable resources.

<DESC>Introduction<br/>
<br/>
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), has a requirement for development of clinical proteomic biomarkers, resources and reagents that will enable clinical researchers to exploit the potential of applied proteomics to advance research related to clinically important fundamental problems in infectious diseases and biodefense.<br/>
<br/>
Description<br/>
<br/>
DMID requires the Clinical Proteomics Centers for Infectious Diseases and Biodefense to discover, qualify, and verify candidate protein biomarkers to be made widely available to the scientific community for use as reagents for further development.  These candidate biomarkers are required to have the potential to be used clinically to improve detection and diagnosis, and to monitor therapeutic and vaccine responses and susceptibility to infection for diseases caused by NIAID Category A-C biodefense and emerging/re-emerging infectious disease pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm). The Centers will be required to provide established high throughput, state-of-the-art proteomics facilities as a resource to NIAID and as a service to the broad scientific community for the conduct of clinical proteomics research projects proposed in collaboration with clinical infectious disease researchers to identify candidate protein biomarkers.   DMID requires the Centers ensure a sustained source of well-characterized human clinical samples for clinical proteomics research projects to be conducted by the Center, and obtain well-characterized human clinical samples from cases and controls necessary to conduct clinical proteomics research projects.  It is anticipated that one or more cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a five-year period of performance beginning on or about 8/1/2009. It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately as follows: 10.45 FTEs.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about August 2, 2007. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.<br/>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION
The United State Air Force is seeking information from interested parties on a replacement for current space-based and ground-based space environmental monitoring capabilities with a possible start in 2010.  Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Block 5D3 carries a five sensor DMSP Space Environmental Sensors (SESS).    The Air Force has a requirement to continue to collect space environmental data in the most cost effective way possible when the DMSP mission ends. Likewise, current ground-based space environmental monitoring capabilities are approaching the end of their design life and are in need of refurbishment or replacement.  These capabilities include the Solar Observing Optical Network (SOON), Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN), and other ground based sensors.

Together, these space-based and ground-based space environmental monitoring capabilities generate data stored in the Joint Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Database (JMDB) at Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) and used by Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System (SWAFS) for analysis, specification, and forecast of the ionosphere, magnetosphere, thermosphere, solar surface, and solar wind/ Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF).  This JMDB space weather data is run through SWAFS software algorithms and models and used by AFWA?s 2nd Weather Squadron to analyze and forecast space environmental impacts on communications, radar, satellite operations, space tracking, navigation, and intelligence collection systems.  Additionally, SWAFS software products and space environmental data from the JMDB are coupled with satellite command and control (C2) and state of health (SOH) data to generate space situational awareness (SSA) products at the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC).  End-to-end continuity of space environmental monitoring, analysis, specification, and forecasting capabilities is required for environmental data fusion in support of SSA.                       

Many studies have been accomplished that point out the importance of space weather.  NSSA developed credible space architecture in 1999. The AF is interested in continuing the collection of data from a DMSP SESS mission as well as upgraded ground sensors. However, equally as important as data gathering is the importance of exploiting the data, the rapid ingestion, processing analysis and dissemination in a manner suitable to user needs.  Thus, the Air Force is interested in talking with organizations (government, labs, spacecraft, and spacecraft sensor contractors) who understand the effect of space weather on their systems and mission areas. Though this RFI addresses the space segment of the space weather end to end architecture, future RFIs may seek feedback from contractors and labs on data exploitation.

Any future acquisition program will be structured to support a block approach to development and technology insertion.  Block 1 will be low risk using proven technologies (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7+) integrated on proven bus and launch vehicles provided by contractors with a documented proven track record of mission success.  We are planning to implement incremental delivery strategy to more rapidly provide initial capability, while concurrently investing in science and technology (S&T) development to support later blocks.  This is in line with the Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent for Space?s letter dated 14 March 2007, titled ??Back to Basics? and Implementing a Block Approach for Space Acquisition?.  !!

PURPOSE

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, we are not at this time seeking proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party?s expense.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. 

Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract or agreement.  The Air Force will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.

SPACE SEGMENT BLOCK 1 INFORMATION SOUGHT

The Air Force desires a cost, schedule and risk assessment to acquire a follow-on to the DMSP SESS suite of sensors.   The follow-on may be an orbital hardware concept or some other combination of space/ground hardware and/or shared/purchased data that will deliver calibrated earth located radiances similar to the current DMSP SDRs and EDRs.  Out of the box concepts are encouraged to suggest innovative ways to produce and exploit space weather data from the ground or from orbiting platforms.  

Should an orbital hardware concept be proposed, the goal is to meet the current DMSP space environmental sensor requirements with a sensor suite as close to the heritage sensors as possible to allow the highest technology readiness levels possible.  Any system technology with a DoD TRL less than 7 (each component must have been demonstrated successfully on-orbit) shall not be included in Block 1, but may be proposed for development and inclusion in Block 2.

Responses should include cost/schedule for procuring launch, orbital assets (payloads and bus), command, control and communications (C3) and ground systems in a complete package.  C3 ground system trades may include maintaining/upgrading DMSP legacy systems or commercial options.      

The baseline concept is two DMSP-like orbital planes with one spacecraft per orbital plane delivered on orbit with a DMSP-like complement of space environmental sensors complete with appropriate ground systems.  First launch availability will be first quarter FY2015 and second will follow two to three years later.  Baseline spacecraft life should be 5 years with a probability of success greater than or equal to 70%.  Other architectures are encouraged as long as they are cost effective and do not require increased system development.  

Though the baseline concept is outlined above for reference, offerors with a proven track record are encouraged to submit innovative concepts to the DMSP SESS continuity mission that fit the block concept of low risk at startup to be followed by incremental improvements.

,.  For cost and schedule estimation, offerors should use a 2nd quarter fiscal year 2010 contract award for sensor build with bus/launch contract to follow as appropriate if the GFE sensor acquisition model is chosen.  Again, these assumptions are given for cost estimation purposes only and the government is only seeking information for market research purposes. !!


SPACE SEGMENT BLOCK 1  DESIRED TECHNICAL GOALS 
 
The baseline requirement set is the current DMSP SORD (available on request). This includes spacecraft collection and processing and transmission to proposed ground sites.  Also include in the cost estimate software to process the satellite data stream into Sensor and Engineering Data Records at Air Force Weather Agency and deposit them into an operational database.  The chart below is a rough summary of the current DMSP SESS specifications.  The complete Interface Control Documents (ICD) for the DMSP SESS suite is available on request.  If an orbital hardware concept is suggested the offeror should consider both bus and payload sensor risk/cost when determining interface standards.

Sensor	Weight (lbs.)	Power (watts)	Data rates (bits/sec)
 	 	 	 
SSUSI	56	35/46*	38000
SSULI	50	25/40*	8200
SSIES3	23	12	2000
SSJ-5	8.5	7	1100
SSM	7.5	6.5	252

	* These represent the average and maximum power!!


SPACE SEGMENT BLOCK 1 SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE 

Following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their responses as they see fit. 

Section 1 Conceptual Alternatives 

Briefly describe one or more alternative architecture concepts for SESS Continuity space segment block 1, including the reliability, flight heritage and technology readiness characteristics of the alternatives.(3-5 pages per alternative)   

Section 2 Feasibility Assessment

Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks.  (1 page per alternative)

Section 3 Cost and Schedule Estimates

Provide cost and schedule estimates for each alternative. The desired business information is an 80% confidence estimate of cost and schedule risk to produce a cost effective system.  Information not subject to proprietary considerations will be used in cost estimates.  The key is to give sufficient basis for estimation to allow fair comparison among concepts and provide a basis for program cost estimates.  These assumptions are given for cost estimation purposes only and the government is only seeking information for market research purposes. (2-3 pages)

The following assumptions may be used for cost and schedule estimation.  
1. Cost/schedule estimate will be at 80% confidence level 
2. Include program level costs to the lowest level possible - SE/PM, IA&T, STE etc.
3. Include discussion of any cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations

SPACE SEGMENT BLOCK 2 INFORMATION SOUGHT

The Air Force desires a cost, schedule and risk assessment to develop the second block of the  DMSP SESS follow-on space segment.   Block 2 may be an orbital hardware concept or some other combination of hardware and/or shared/purchased data that will deliver calibrated earth located measurements similar to that proposed for NPOESS.  

Should an orbital hardware concept be proposed, the goal is to meet the NPOESS Integrated Operational Requirements Document (IORD) SESS requirement set.  Block 2 development will be concurrent with Block 1 production.  Offerors with a proven track record are encouraged to submit innovative concepts to improve on the performance and cost of the Block 1 SESS constellation.  These concepts may me limited to new or improved sensors or full up systems. The development period goal is to bring TRL levels of more advanced and innovative technology concepts up to a level (TRL 7+) where they can be dependably flown on the Block 2 operational system.  The agencies responding to this RFI need not address all systems/sensors mentioned in the RFI, but may focus on a subset of these systems/sensors.  Other innovative concepts to characterizing the earth?s orbital space environments are also encouraged

SPACE SEGMENT BLOCK 2 DESIRED TECHNICAL GOALS 

Achieve NPOESS Space environmental sensing requirements as outlined in the IORD and the NPOESS General Instrument Interface Document  (NGIID) available on request!!

SPACE SEGMENT BLOCK 2 SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE 

Following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their responses as they see fit. 

Section 1 Conceptual Alternatives 

Briefly describe one or more alternative architecture concepts for Block 2 SESS follow-on, including the development required, technology readiness characteristics and risk.  Also, relate expected performance to NPOESS IORD requirements.  (3-5 pages per alternative)   

Section 2 Feasibility Assessment

Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks.  (1 page per alternative)

Section 3 Cost and Schedule Estimates

Provide cost and schedule estimates for each alternative. The desired business information is a 50% confidence estimate of cost and schedule to produce a cost effective Block 2 Space Segment.  Focus should be on readying technologies for inclusion in Block 2.   The key is to give sufficient basis for estimation to allow fair comparison among concepts and provide a basis for program cost estimates.  These assumptions are given for cost estimation purposes only and the government is only seeking information for market research purposes. (2-3 pages)

The following assumptions may be used for cost and schedule estimation.  
1. 80% confidence cost/schedule estimate for readying technologies for insertion into Block 2
2. Include program level costs to the lowest level possible - SE/PM, IA&T, STE etc.
3. Include discussion of any cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations
4. Provide phased costs - assume annual inflation rate of 4% for development and production 
5. Do not include fee in cost estimates 
6. Government FY2010 contract award 
  
Section 4 Corporate Expertise

Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information you deem relevant.

<DESC>Amendment No. 01 provides the following: 1) Answers to questions received in response to the subject solicitation: Question 1:  Can you provide a brief list of possible analytes of interest for analysis on this system? Answer: In addition to doing isotope and/or speciation work on nutrients (N, P) and carbon compounds, the system must be capable of analyzing a set of compounds that are now being referred to as "Emerging Contaminants". These compounds include a large number of pharmaceutically active compounds, endocrine disruptors, and pesticides. A recent, as yet unpublished study, reviews published analytical techniques for 304 of the most common "Emerging Contaminant" compounds and performed molecular modeling on classes of those compounds to determine appropriate analytical procedures for them. The results of those studies indicate that 30% of the compounds of interest would be best analyzed for by GC-MS/MS and 70% would be best analyzed for by LC-MS/MS, but that neither analytical technique alone would be effective for all of the compounds of interest. Question 2:  Will the system be operated mainly in GC or LC mode? Or will you be switching frequently during the day? Answer: Due to the possibility of degradation of the compounds of interest, samples must be run as soon as they are received from the field. Since 70% of the compounds of interest will be run in LC and 30% will be run in GC, the system will need to be switched at least daily by laboratory personnel. It is important that this operation not take more than one-half hour. Question 3: How many samples per week would you be analyzing? (i.e., is this a high throughput system?).  The answer to this would affect which LC unit would be more effective. Answer: We anticipate 100-200 compounds per week for our own purposes, but already have requests from collaborators to participate in further studies. Therefore a high-throughput capability is necessary. Question 4: Is the LC provided as part of the total cost?  If so, is it also a demonstration unit or new?
Answer:  Yes, the LC and LC autosampler is included as part of the cost.  In addition, the GC unit must be capable of fully interfacing with an autosampler we currently own (CombiPal G6500-CTC with SPME Upgrade G6504-CTC, Control software G3384AA), or it must include a GC autosampler capable of performing liquid, headspace, and SMPE injections. We are looking for a Demonstration Unit for all components. The demonstration unit shall have not more than 100 hours of usage. 2) This requirement is corrected from a Small Business Set=Aside to Unrestricted.
2) THE DATE SPECIFIED FOR RECEIPT OF OFFERS REMAINS JULY 23, 2007.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions submitted by industry.  1.  QUESTION:  Which Help Desk is currently being used at Bolling AFB and if one is not being used, is a requirement perhaps to install a Help Desk?

ANSWER:  Bolling Clinic has its own Help Desk.

2.  QUESTION:  Is this market research in preparation for a potential recompete of existing work?  If so, is this the NETCENTS task order that was awarded to Northrup Grumman on 1 Sep 06?

ANSWER:  Yes this is a recompete of existing work.   The incumbent is not Northrop Grumman.

3.  QUESTION:  We understand that AHLTA has experienced performance issues and has not always been well received by the user community.  If a new contract/task order results from your current market research do you contemplate the contractor having an opportunity to make significant improvements to AHLTA to positively impact the user experience or will the resulting contract/task order sustain the current capability and provide user training/support for the current capability?

ANSWER:  No improvements to AHLTA are expected on any Task Order/Contract which may ulitmately be issued.  Any Task Order/Contract will continue current capabilities.  The sources sought synopsis was issued for market research purposes only, and is not a request for proposals (RFP).  An RFP may be issued as a result of this sources sought synopsis.

4.  QUESTION:  What will the relationship with Clinical Information Technology Office (CITPO) be, if any, as they were the guiding agency for the initial deployment and AHLTA is a DOD wide application.

ANSWER:  The contractor will not be expected to have any relationship with CITPO?that is a Service responsibility.
 
5.  QUESTION:  Given that there is Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) work listed, is there going to be the need to interface regularly with the development teams and the other branches or are we speaking about clinic and MTF level flow of operation?

ANSWER:  BPR in this SSS and any contract which may ultimately be issued is directly in reference to AF MTF/clinic workflow and operations.
 
6.  QUESTION:  Are help desk tickets still being run through the local help desks? During the initial implementation tickets were directed to the local help desk and then escalated.

ANSWER:  Yes, Help Desk tickets still originate at the local Military Treatment Facility (MTF) Help Desk level.
 
7.  QUESTION:  What is the scope and level of effort? Are we talking about training entire MTF staffs on application updates, just new hires at each MTF, both or some other combination? The implications of this are huge in terms of the types and volume of staffing.

ANSWER:  Scope of work includes:  training for MTF staff new to the AF, as needed remedial training to all MTF staff, new functionality training to all MTF staff.  Level of effort is all CONUS and OCONUS AF MTFs.
 
8.  QUESTION:  I am assuming that the Air Force is still using the training outline for classroom and on-the-job training and has access to all of the training materials generated by UNISYS and SAIC and intends to use them. Is this correct or is the Air Force looking to develop and new strategy and curriculum?

ANSWER:  AF intends to use CITPO/MHS provided materials.  If additional materials are needed for new functionality and are not provided by CITPO/MHS, AF will develop the materials.
 
9.  QUESTION:  How is sustainment currently being managed? Are there sustainment trainers at the MTFs that will become part of the team, remain seperate or go away?

ANSWER:  Current program provides trainers at AF MTFs with some resource sharing of trainers between facilities.  The team approach for both technical and functional ?care and feeding? of AHLTA is encouraged and supported by the AF.
 
10.  QUESTION:  Has the Air Force set proficiency standards for end users and if so how does the Air Force intend to measure them? Is the Air Force going to use the proficiency standards of the initial deployment or something else?

ANSWER:  No.  No proficiency standards were set as contract performance metric for initial deployment.  AF policy outlines expected 100% utilization of AHLTA.
 
11.  QUESTION:  How does the Air Force intend to manage Information Assurance (IA) and security issues?

ANSWER:  AF requires IA and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) certification and this can only be done once the trainer is at the MTF.  It will be up to the contractor to decide how to staff the sites and for what duration to meet AF requirements for AHLTA training.
All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

The Contractor will define, establish, document, and implement a Continued Airworthiness Program (CAP) to predict and prevent fatigue separations.  

The CAP must: contain: 

1.	Define and describe the contractor's airworthiness program and how it meets the exhibit requirements.

2.	Insure that the aircraft has been issued a Standard or Restricted certificate by the FAA.

3.	Meet the intent of developing a maintenance and inspection program specific to their airtanker fleet.

4.	Submit documents for FAA approved Instructions for Continued Airworthiness in accordance with FAR 25.1529 at Amendment Level 54 or later, and be based on the FAA Type certification. 

Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA) are maintenance actions defined by the TC or STC holder in accordance with 14 CFR 25.1529 and delivered with the airplane or provided by the manufacturer. ICA's are documented information that includes applicable methods, inspections, processes, procedures and airworthiness limitations.


1.	Obtain documentation of manufacturer support for maintenance of the aircraft while the vendor is operating their aircraft in the firefighting role. 

2.	Include an evaluation of the airtanker structure (airframe and tank) to FAR 25.571 at Amendment Level 96 or later.  

Amendment 96 of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 25.571 requires that it ?be demonstrated with sufficient full-scale test evidence that WFD will not occur within the design service goal of the airplane. It requires special consideration for WFD and requires full scale fatigue testing have been completed on a same model airframe.  The corresponding Advisory Circular (AC) 25.571-1C provides general guidelines on the requirements and recommends rigorous posttest teardown inspections as a way to generate sufficient evidence. However, AC 25.571-1C does not specify the teardown protocol, inspection procedures, data collection, and subsequent analyses. Comprehensive guidelines and data that are documented and available to the broader aviation community are lacking. It would require that an LOV (or DSG) be established for the airframe.  


1.	Install and monitor an aircraft Operational Load Monitoring (OLM) system for the purpose of updating and improving the continued airworthiness of the Contractor's aircraft.  

2.	Provide for the Contractor to submit revised ICA's to the FAA for approval based on the operation of the aircraft as an airtanker using the data collected from the OLM system.  The revised ICA would be based on either an analysis similar to that used in FAA certification or a combination of analysis used for FAA certification and data obtained from firefighting operations.  As a minimum, revised ICA's would be submitted prior to the 3rd year of the contract.  Copies of the package submitted to the FAA will be sent to the Contracting Officer.

3.	Explain how a quality assurance program will be put in place to insure that the Contractor can predict and prevent fatigue separations.

<CONTACT>Geoffrey Ling, DARPA Program Manager, DSO, Phone (571) 218-4674, Fax (703) 807-4956, Email gling@darpa.mil
<DESC>Human Assisted Neural Devices RFI, SN07-43, Responses Due 4 P.M. ET, August 15, 2007, POC: Dr. Geoffrey Ling, DARPA/DSO; Phone: (571) 218-4674; Fax: (703) 807-4956.

Description

The Human Assisted Neural Devices (HAND) program at DARPA has provided the basis for a number of assistive devices controlled, in part, by neural signals provided by the user. There is continued interest in discovering the underlying processing structures the brain uses to perform tasks, with the eventual goal of leveraging these processes with algorithms and models that can control external assistive devices. 

An approach that takes into account the distributed nature of neural functioning, the dynamics of neural plasticity and changes to functional networks, as well as analysis that encompass the wide spatial and temporal scales of neural processing is more appropriately descriptive of the underlying information processes of the brain. Consequently, a new experimental and theoretical paradigm is needed if we are to advance beyond incremental advances in development. 

Information Sought

This RFI seeks information on relevant technologies and concepts that could form the basis for a DARPA program to develop a HAND Phase Next. This RFI seeks methods of analysis and interpretation that will enable the control of next generation assistive devices that seek to interpret and treat issues of control and feedback that are more analogous to processes used by the brain. Moreover, this RFI is interested in methods which will provide more robust control of dexterous systems while reducing compilation of data, training time on device use, and alleviating computational burdens. 
Specifically, this RFI seeks information on relevant technologies, capabilities, and concepts in the following areas:

1.	Cross-regional data extraction: Neural functions are anatomically focused in certain areas of the brain, but the underlying task processes are distributed across several regions. By accessing the processes at numerous nodes in the brain, more robust control methods can be developed
2.	Multi-signal extraction: Information transmission between neurons is mediated by chemical and electrical means. This RFI seeks methods that can interpret and extract information from a broad spectrum of transmission methods that might include neurotransmitter levels and release/reuptake, pre- and post-synaptic potentials, and action potentials. 
3.	Rule-based interpretation: Methods which attempt to determine the underlying principles of information organization and transmission between neurons and synapses may be more successful in establishing more robust methods of controlling devices that rely on less data.  
4.	Multi-modality sensory feedback: This RFI seeks new methods of providing feedback to the user separate from visual cues.  More natural ways to interpret sensory feedback may lead to faster acquisition of device use and ease of interpretation of new stimuli. 
5.	Plasticity: Current methods of control rely on algorithms which must be adjusted as functional networks change and users adapt to new tasks. This RFI seeks new methods which allow interfaces to automatically compensate for the adaptive nature of the brain. 

INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDERS 

DARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources, including but not limited to, universities, university affiliated research centers, and private or public companies.

<DESC>Please see udpated response date and change in Point of Contact for Offerors.The Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment facilities in Hawaii, Gu am, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Trocars - Disposable. This new RFRIAQ supersedes the previous solicitation for Trocars solicitation number W81K02-T-07-3016 which was posted on April 30, 2007, closed on May 21, 2007, and cancelled on June 14, 2007. The new closing date for this posting is August 10, 2007 and t his date is established due to a change in the clinical evaluation process. The change in the process includes a requirement for clinical in-servicing by the vendor prior to the clinical evaluation. All responses to this solicitation must be resubmitted fr esh before the closing date of August 10, 2007. No prior submissions for this product line in any previous FBO will be considered or evaluated.  The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the D oD Prime Vendor Program.   The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, and the 121st Combat Support Hospital, Korea. This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreemen t (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a s upplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil The agreement will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of award with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is June 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determi ned utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria. Point of Contact Susan Hwang, TRBO Team Leader, 808-433-3686, susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil B.	Products & Performance Required The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Trocars-Disposable. For this product line, the yearly estimated total usage/forecasted requirement for this region is $159,465.84. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales f or a 12-month period.  At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information,  and itemization of brands, types of packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.  C.	Instructions to Offerors DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received prior t o the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.   This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, on-site in-person in-servicing, product literature, education and training materials, and submission of  electronic best price offers. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC that their initial submission, quote, and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.   D.	 Evaluation Criteria The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the deciding officials for this in itiative.   Phase I: Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of the tech nical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  	 Phase II:  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 15 business days to ship s amples. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the (15th) business day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a likert type scale, using a one to five rating. One is equal to not acceptable, Three point seven five is equal to acceptable, and five is equal to highly acceptable. All clinical/perform ance criteria are weighted equally.  The TPRB has set a 3.75 minimally acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable for standardization and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  All vendors will be required to provide an on-site, in-person in-service to Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC), prior to the use of their Trocar - Disposable products. Vendors who cannot provide on-site, in-person in-servicing to TAMC will be disqualified.  The TPRBs rationale for in-servicing of this product group is in compliance with the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses Position Statement The role of the health care industry representative in the perioperative/invasive procedure setting (A ORN Recommended practices, and Guidelines, 2007). In-service is required to meet the governments minimum need and is normal and customary. Vendors will also be required to provide an on-site, in-person in-service to NH Guam, NH Yokosuka, NH Okinawa, and the 121st CSH OR vendors must send product literature, training aides and teaching materials to these MTFs prior to the clinical evaluation p rocess. Vendors who cannot provide on-site, in-person in-servicing OR product literature, training aides, and teaching materials will be disqualified. The TPRBs rationale for in-servicing of this product group is in compliance with the Association of periO perative Registered Nurses Position Statement The role of the health care industry representative in the perioperative/invasive procedure setting (AORN Recommended practices, and Guidelines, 2007). In-service is required to meet the governments minimum need and is normal and customary. The following steps are the on-site clinical evaluation process for Tripler Army Medical Center 1) Each vendor will provide on-site, in-person, in-servicing for a period of one week to TAMC. One vendor per wee k will be evaluated. 2) Day 1: vendor will provide in-servicing to the operating room staff. A presentation reviewing the technical aspects of the device, the indications for use of the device, and how to use the device will be addressed. 3) Day 2-5: clini cal evaluations will be conducted. The vendor will be available for any questions, consultations, or guidance regarding the product. 4) All vendors will be required to meet the standards of conduct in accordance with facility policies, local, state, and fe deral regulations. The following steps are the on-site clinical evaluation process for NH Guam, NH Yokosuka, NH Okinawa and the 121st CSH. 1) Each vendor will provide on-site, in person, in-servicing for a period of one week to the MTF. One vendor per week will be evaluated.  2) Day 1: vendor will provide in-servicing to the operating room staff. A presentation reviewing the technical aspects of the device, the indications for use of the device, and how to use the device will be addressed. 3) Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will  be conducted. The vendor will be available for any questions, consultations, or guidance regarding the product. 4) All vendors will be required to meet the standards of conduct in accordance with facility policies, local, state, and federal regulations. The following steps are the training aid clinical evaluation process for NH Guam, NH Yokosuka, NH Okinawa, and the 121st CSH. 1) Each vendor will provide product literature, training aides and teaching material prior to the clinical evaluation. 2) Day 1: t he staff will review all literature and teaching aides provided by a vendor. 3) Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be conducted. Vendors will be available by telephone for questions, consultations and guidance. Phase III. After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who meet the minimum 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total  requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region. Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods  (not to exceed 5 years). Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.   1.

<DESC>National Security Technologies, LLC (NSTec) is seeking sources that can provide equipment needed to cut through several bundles of coaxial cables and wire ropes that are currently in the U6c emplacement hole at the Nevada Test Site.  This equipment is to be rented for one time use.  These cables and wire ropes must be cut off as close to the bottom of the emplacement hole as practical (460? +/- 10' depth of desired cut).  The emplacement hole is 88" in diameter and reaches to a depth of approximately 470'.  Approximately one half of this emplacement hole is open for the lowering of equipment.  The cables and wire rope bundles reside in the other half of the emplacement hole.  Equipment must be lowered to the correct depth, stabilized, cut through the cable and wire rope harness bundles, and be raised back to the surface.  Cables and wire rope harnesses will be supported from above and removed from the emplacement hole when cutting operations are complete.  Technical guidance in the form of an expert on the equipment used is required to be on site during use of the equipment.  However, will only provide guidance and will not operate the equipment (no hands on, i.e. vendor will not do contact work).  NSTec engineering will interface with the vendor to ensure compatibility with equipment used to lower and stabilize the cutting equipment.  NSTec construction will do all actual contact work including operation of the rented cutting equipment.
Interested sources are requested to provide type of equipment they would offer to complete the job described above, company name, business size, point of contact with phone number and email address no later than July 27, 2007 to Emma Fox at foxeb@nv.doe.gov

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the supplies and services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 14 calendar days from the date of this synopsis. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Biological Resources Division, has a requirement for on-site dog-handler training and project support for the USGS Brown Treesnake Canine Team located on Guam.  Vendor must be located on Guam and specialized in detector dog training, behavioral analysis, and methodological support.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(l), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the specified supplies and services as a sole source procurement from Dog Training Squad, Isla Vet Clinic, 866 Route 7, Hagatna, Guam, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required supplies and services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY; NO FORMAL RFQ WILL BE AVAILABLE.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC>I.	Introduction: NASA/JSC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for development and certification of Space-to-Ground Antenna (SGANT) or Space-to-Ground Antenna Group (SGAG) for use on the International Space Station (ISS).  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. II.	Background and Requirement: The impetus for conducting market research is based upon the future need to launch a replacement SGANT on a new vehicle, which will go into service after the Space Shuttle is retired.  Accordingly, JSC is interested in new technologies and SGANT or SGAG concepts that result in lighter and smaller launch payloads while enhancing the reliability of space-qualified hardware.   The following paragraphs provide a top-level summary of the functional and performance requirements for the replacement SGANT or SGAG: The current SGANT consists of a Parabolic Reflector Assembly, Monopulse Feed, structural launch interface, antenna steering motors and controllers, and is mounted on the Z1 truss/boom of the ISS and has provisions to support Extravehicular Activity (EVA) handling. The SGANT provides for the transmission of KuBand Radio Frequency (RF) signals from the Space Station to the ground via the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) satellites.  The KuBand Single Access Forward (KSAF) communications signal from a TDRS to the Ku Band Antenna is centered at 13,775 MHz with an operating bandwidth of 50 MHz and receive gain greater than or equal to 42.9 dBic to support a data rate of 6(BPSK)-12(QPSK) Mbps.	The KuBand Single Access Return (KSAR) communications signal from the Ku Band Antenna to a TDRS is centered at 15,003.4 MHz with an operating bandwidth of 225 MHz and transmit gain greater than or equal to 43.5 dBic to support a minimum data rate of 150 (BPSK) and up to 300 (QPSK) Mbps. Reference the Space Network Users Guide (SNUG) Revision 8 for detailed link requirements. The current SGANT has two 120 VDC electrical power interfaces with the ISS for operation and for heaters. The Space-to-Ground Transmitter-Receiver-Controller (SGTRC) provides a command and status interface with the ISS Command and Control Multiplexer/Demultiplexer (C&C MDM), SGANT pointing control, RF frequency conversion and amplification, and RF interfaces with the SGANT.	The SGTRC exchanges modulated intermediate frequency signals with other communications equipment on the ISS. The SGTRC has two 120 VDC electrical power interfaces with the ISS for operation and for heaters. Primary support for SGANT pointing is accomplished via two-axis monopulse autotracking using the TDRSS Ku-Band Forward (KSAF) service as a tracking beacon.  Open-Loop pointing is also provided for acquisition and as a backup mode using antenna pointing coordinates supplied over the command interface with the C&C MDM .  The SGANT/SGTRC uses a nominal 2 degree radius spiral search to spatially acquire the TDRSS forward link beacon, and after closed-loop acquisition, maintains pointing to within 0.25 dB. The SGANT and SGTRC are mounted externally on the Z1 Integrated Truss Segment and have provisions to support Extravehicular Activity (EVA) handling. The SGTRC would be retained if only the antenna is procured. If the group is purchased, the SGTRC functions will be incorporated in the SGAG.  The replacement SGAG requires the integration of the SGANT and SGTRC functions into one Orbital Replacement Unit (ORU).  The need to replace the SGTRC function is driven by the requirement to double the data rates on both the Forward and Return channels.  Another option under consideration is moving the RF service from Ku-Band to Ka-Band.   NASA is interested in learning of recently deployed or soon-to-be deployed designs for Antennas and associated RF electronics compatible with the NASA Space Network per SNUG at Ku or Ka-Band that are space-flight certified for low-earth orbit environments that meet, or have the potential to meet the essential functional requirements discussed above. In addition, the design should meet or, or have the potential to meet the following salient requirements related to launch on new vehicle: The replacement SGANT or SGAG, including any Flight Support Equipment, shall not exceed a maximum launch cargo envelope of 145 inches long by 80 inches wide by 57 inches high. The mass including FSE shall not exceed 750 Kg. The antenna or antenna group shall be designed to withstand a non-operating temperature range of -40 degrees F to +140 degrees F. The ORU shall survive a launch acceleration of 4.5 m/sec2 at 30 rad/sec2 in any single axis and overall acoustics of 140 dB, with overall random vibrations of 4.0 x 9.8 m/sec2 rms. The SGAG or SGANT shall survive an ambient pressure change rate of 4600 Pa/sec.   Design, development, ground testing and certification of the new SGANT or SGAG will be provided by the vendor with a follow-on test with a TDRSS to verify operations with the SGANT Design, Verification, and Test Module (DVTM) hardware utilizing 1553 command and control. III.	Responses: Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement of 10 pages or less indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein and a brief statement of expertise in developing similar space communication equipment.	 Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).   Technical questions should be directed to: Timothy Early via timothy.w.early@nasa.gov.  Procurement related questions should be directed to: Michal Malik via michal.k.malik@nasa.gov. Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to Michal Malik no later than August 24, 2007.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION
The United State Air Force is seeking information from interested parties on a replacement for current space-based and ground-based space environmental monitoring capabilities with a possible start in 2010.  Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Block 5D3 carries a five sensor DMSP Space Environmental Sensors (SESS).    The Air Force has a requirement to continue to collect space environmental data in the most cost effective way possible when the DMSP mission ends. Likewise, current ground-based space environmental monitoring capabilities are approaching the end of their design life and are in need of refurbishment or replacement.  These capabilities include the Solar Observing Optical Network (SOON), Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN), and other ground based sensors.

Together, these space-based and ground-based space environmental monitoring capabilities generate data stored in the Joint Meteorological and Oceanographic (METOC) Database (JMDB) at Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) and used by Space Weather Analysis and Forecast System (SWAFS) for analysis, specification, and forecast of the ionosphere, magnetosphere, thermosphere, solar surface, and solar wind/ Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF).  This JMDB space weather data is run through SWAFS software algorithms and models and used by AFWA?s 2nd Weather Squadron to analyze and forecast space environmental impacts on communications, radar, satellite operations, space tracking, navigation, and intelligence collection systems.  Additionally, SWAFS software products and space environmental data from the JMDB are coupled with satellite command and control (C2) and state of health (SOH) data to generate space situational awareness (SSA) products at the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC).  End-to-end continuity of space environmental monitoring, analysis, specification, and forecasting capabilities is required for environmental data fusion in support of SSA.                       

Many studies have been accomplished that point out the importance of space weather.  NSSA developed credible space architecture in 1999. The AF is interested in continuing the collection of data from a DMSP SESS mission as well as upgraded ground sensors. However, equally as important as data gathering is the importance of exploiting the data, the rapid ingestion, processing analysis and dissemination in a manner suitable to user needs.  Thus, the Air Force is interested in talking with organizations (government, labs, spacecraft, and spacecraft sensor contractors) who understand the effect of space weather on their systems and mission areas. Though this RFI addresses the space segment of the space weather end to end architecture, future RFIs may seek feedback from contractors and labs on data exploitation.

Any future acquisition program will be structured to support a block approach to development and technology insertion.  Block 1 will be low risk using proven technologies (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7+) integrated on proven bus and launch vehicles provided by contractors with a documented proven track record of mission success.  We are planning to implement incremental delivery strategy to more rapidly provide initial capability, while concurrently investing in science and technology (S&T) development to support later blocks.  This is in line with the Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent for Space?s letter dated 14 March 2007, titled ??Back to Basics? and Implementing a Block Approach for Space Acquisition?.  !!

SPACE SEGMENT BLOCK 1 INFORMATION SOUGHT

The Air Force desires a cost, schedule and risk assessment to acquire a follow-on to the DMSP SESS suite of sensors.   The follow-on may be an orbital hardware concept or some other combination of space/ground hardware and/or shared/purchased data that will deliver calibrated earth located radiances similar to the current DMSP SDRs and EDRs.  Out of the box concepts are encouraged to suggest innovative ways to produce and exploit space weather data from the ground or from orbiting platforms.  

Should an orbital hardware concept be proposed, the goal is to meet the current DMSP space environmental sensor requirements with a sensor suite as close to the heritage sensors as possible to allow the highest technology readiness levels possible.  Any system technology with a DoD TRL less than 7 (each component must have been demonstrated successfully on-orbit) shall not be included in Block 1, but may be proposed for development and inclusion in Block 2.

Responses should include cost/schedule for procuring launch, orbital assets (payloads and bus), command, control and communications (C3) and ground systems in a complete package.  C3 ground system trades may include maintaining/upgrading DMSP legacy systems or commercial options.      

The baseline concept is two DMSP-like orbital planes with one spacecraft per orbital plane delivered on orbit with a DMSP-like complement of space environmental sensors complete with appropriate ground systems.  First launch availability will be first quarter FY2015 and second will follow two to three years later.  Baseline spacecraft life should be 5 years with a probability of success greater than or equal to 70%.  Other architectures are encouraged as long as they are cost effective and do not require increased system development.  

Though the baseline concept is outlined above for reference, offerors with a proven track record are encouraged to submit innovative concepts to the DMSP SESS continuity mission that fit the block concept of low risk at startup to be followed by incremental improvements.

,.  For cost and schedule estimation, offerors should use a 2nd quarter fiscal year 2010 contract award for sensor build with bus/launch contract to follow as appropriate if the GFE sensor acquisition model is chosen.  Again, these assumptions are given for cost estimation purposes only and the government is only seeking information for market research purposes. !!


SPACE SEGMENT BLOCK 1  DESIRED TECHNICAL GOALS 
 
The baseline requirement set is the current DMSP SORD (available on request). This includes spacecraft collection and processing and transmission to proposed ground sites.  Also include in the cost estimate software to process the satellite data stream into Sensor and Engineering Data Records at Air Force Weather Agency and deposit them into an operational database.  The chart below is a rough summary of the current DMSP SESS specifications.  The complete Interface Control Documents (ICD) for the DMSP SESS suite is available on request.  If an orbital hardware concept is suggested the offeror should consider both bus and payload sensor risk/cost when determining interface standards.

Sensor	Weight (lbs.)	Power (watts)	Data rates (bits/sec)
 	 	 	 
SSUSI	56	35/46*	38000
SSULI	50	25/40*	8200
SSIES3	23	12	2000
SSJ-5	8.5	7	1100
SSM	7.5	6.5	252

	* These represent the average and maximum power!!


SPACE SEGMENT BLOCK 1 SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE 

Following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their responses as they see fit. 

Section 1 Conceptual Alternatives 

Briefly describe one or more alternative architecture concepts for SESS Continuity space segment block 1, including the reliability, flight heritage and technology readiness characteristics of the alternatives.(3-5 pages per alternative)   

Section 2 Feasibility Assessment

Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks.  (1 page per alternative)

Section 3 Cost and Schedule Estimates

Provide cost and schedule estimates for each alternative. The desired business information is an 80% confidence estimate of cost and schedule risk to produce a cost effective system.  Information not subject to proprietary considerations will be used in cost estimates.  The key is to give sufficient basis for estimation to allow fair comparison among concepts and provide a basis for program cost estimates.  These assumptions are given for cost estimation purposes only and the government is only seeking information for market research purposes. (2-3 pages)

The following assumptions may be used for cost and schedule estimation.  
1. Cost/schedule estimate will be at 80% confidence level 
2. Include program level costs to the lowest level possible - SE/PM, IA&T, STE etc.
3. Include discussion of any cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations
4. Provide phased costs - assume an annual inflation rate of 4% for development and production 
5. Do not include fee in cost estimation 
6. 2nd quarter government fiscal year 2010 contract award 
7. First launch availability: first quarter government FY2015 
8. Baseline is  two spacecraft for Block 1 with an expected life of 5 years with a probability of success greater than or equal to 70%.  

Section 4 Corporate Expertise

Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information, and other information you deem relevant. A prime consideration should be the recent (last five years) past performance of the offeror and the maturity of the technologies proposed.

In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved in that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI, including management and operations approach, and any relevant lessons learned.  (No suggested page count)

Section 5 Additional Materials

Please provide any other materials, suggestions, and discussions you deem appropriate.  Include any recommended structure of the requirements in the event the government plans to issue a request for proposal.

SPACE SEGMENT BLOCK 2 INFORMATION SOUGHT

The Air Force desires a cost, schedule and risk assessment to develop the second block of the  DMSP SESS follow-on space segment.   Block 2 may be an orbital hardware concept or some other combination of hardware and/or shared/purchased data that will deliver calibrated earth located measurements similar to that proposed for NPOESS.  

Should an orbital hardware concept be proposed, the goal is to meet the NPOESS Integrated Operational Requirements Document (IORD) SESS requirement set.  Block 2 development will be concurrent with Block 1 production.  Offerors with a proven track record are encouraged to submit innovative concepts to improve on the performance and cost of the Block 1 SESS constellation.  These concepts may me limited to new or improved sensors or full up systems. The development period goal is to bring TRL levels of more advanced and innovative technology concepts up to a level (TRL 7+) where they can be dependably flown on the Block 2 operational system.  The agencies responding to this RFI need not address all systems/sensors mentioned in the RFI, but may focus on a subset of these systems/sensors.  Other innovative concepts to characterizing the earth?s orbital space environments are also encouraged

SPACE SEGMENT BLOCK 2 DESIRED TECHNICAL GOALS 

Achieve NPOESS Space environmental sensing requirements as outlined in the IORD and the NPOESS General Instrument Interface Document  (NGIID) available on request!!

SPACE SEGMENT BLOCK 2 SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE 

Following is a suggested outline and suggested page counts for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their responses as they see fit. 

Section 1 Conceptual Alternatives 

Briefly describe one or more alternative architecture concepts for Block 2 SESS follow-on, including the development required, technology readiness characteristics and risk.  Also, relate expected performance to NPOESS IORD requirements.  (3-5 pages per alternative)   

Section 2 Feasibility Assessment

Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements and risks.  (1 page per alternative)

Section 3 Cost and Schedule Estimates

Provide cost and schedule estimates for each alternative. The desired business information is a 50% confidence estimate of cost and schedule to produce a cost effective Block 2 Space Segment.  Focus should be on readying technologies for inclusion in Block 2.   The key is to give sufficient basis for estimation to allow fair comparison among concepts and provide a basis for program cost estimates.  These assumptions are given for cost estimation purposes only and the government is only seeking information for market research purposes. (2-3 pages)

The following assumptions may be used for cost and schedule estimation.  
1. 80% confidence cost/schedule estimate for readying technologies for insertion into Block 2
2. Include program level costs to the lowest level possible - SE/PM, IA&T, STE etc.
3. Include discussion of any cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations
4. Provide phased costs - assume annual inflation rate of 4% for development and production 
5. Do not include fee in cost estimates 
6. Government FY2010 contract award

<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is seeking information on all sources capable of providing screening and testing services to continue the NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program (PDSP), which was first initiated in 1992. 

To be considered responsive to this request for sources, the organization must be qualified to: (1) establish and validate assays for cloned human or rodent receptors by cloning a receptor, maintaining a stably transfected cell line expressing the receptor, and establishing the binding and functional assays for the receptor in accordance with standards established in the published scientific literature; (2) conduct high-throughput screening of compounds in broad-based primary and secondary pharmacological assays (radioligand binding and enzyme assays), functional assays, and assays to assess brain penetrance, bioavailability, and cardiac toxicity (Note - the screening services are intended primarily as a screen for compounds that have previously been shown to possess pharmacological, biochemical, or behavioral activities relevant to NIMH, rather than for the purpose of large-scale, random screening of natural products or combinatorial libraries) (3) provide an electronic data file of screening results for each compound suitable for inclusion in a scientific publication; and (4) update and maintain a Ki database for compounds and drugs.

Qualified sources must be able to receive and test approximately 2,500 (but could range from 2,000-3,000) coded samples (synthetic compounds, small molecules, gene products, and natural product extracts) per year, in a wide variety of human and rodent CNS receptor and enzyme screening assays and functional assays, and to provide an electronic data file for each of the screened compounds.  (A list of targets of interest to NIMH can be found at http://pdsp.med.unc.edu/pdspw/clones.php.) At least 85% of these samples are to be tested in human recombinant receptor assays.  Samples for screening can include, but are not limited to, novel chemical entities, structural analogs of lead compounds, genes or gene products, small molecules, enzyme inhibitors, and natural products.

Based on historical data, the projected annual assay workload for this requirement is estimated at: 1) 15,000 primary pharmacological assays; 2) 1500 secondary pharmacological assays; 3) 15,000 functional assays; 4) 1,000 brain penetrance, bioavailability, or toxicity assays; and 5) 5-10 new assays developed and validated. These are estimates, which can fluctuate as much as 50% higher or lower than the number of assays stated.

The NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program currently operates under a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC), which allows a deviation from the standard Patent Rights clause in FAR 52.227-14, to ensure the confidentiality and protect the intellectual property and patent rights of an investigator or party supplying a proprietary sample or composition of matter for testing through the program.  It is the intention of the Government to seek a continuation of that DEC to allow use of a similar deviation in the currently proposed requirement.  

Any business or organization that believes it has the capability to fulfill this requirement should submit a brief narrative response (no more than 5-10 pages, single-spaced), indicating previous experience and capabilities related to the described work. Capability Statements should clearly state/describe: 1) your experience and qualifications to perform this work; 2) your type of business or organization, including: (a) size (number of employees); (b) management structure and history; (c) eligibility under 8(a) or other set-aside programs, as applicable, for NAICS Code 541710 (500 employees); and 3) any specific resources, equipment, available to perform this work. 

PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME; THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. 
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT, NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO RECEIPT NOTICE WILL BE SENT TO THE SUBMITTER OF A CAPABILITY STATEMENT OR EVALUATION PROVIDED OF ANY RESPECTIVE CAPABILITY STATEMENT RECEIVED.

<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is seeking information on all sources capable of providing contract services to continue the NIMH Chemical Synthesis and Drug Supply Program (CSDSP).  The goal of the CSDSP is to synthesize and distribute novel or otherwise difficult-to-obtain psychoactive compounds to the scientific community to stimulate basic and clinical research in mental health.  The program provides for the synthesis of ligands for CNS receptors, radiolabeled compounds for autoradiography and neuroimaging, biochemical markers, drug analogs and metabolites, and reference standards, as well as cGMP synthesis of promising compounds for clinical studies. Synthesis projects may also include medicinal chemistry tasks to optimize promising compounds for use as research tools or for clinical applications.  The CSDSP Inventory of approximately 400 compounds serves as a repository for the compounds produced and allows for quick distribution of these compounds upon request.  The program also distributes plated sets of inventory compounds.  Capable sources must be able to provide: (1) Non-GMP synthesis of compounds which may include new drugs, imaging precursors, analogs, metabolites, neuropeptides, small molecules, radiolabeled compounds, analytical standards, synthetic intermediates, probes, and any related compounds; (2) cGMP synthesis of compounds and the preparation analytical results in a format suitable for inclusion in and Investigation New Drug (IND) or NDA Chemistry and Manufacturing section; (3) limited medicinal chemistry optimization of lead compounds; (4) maintenance and distribution of the compounds in the NIMH Chemical Synthesis and Drug Supply Program Inventory; and (5) creation and distribution of small, plated compound arrays.  

Based upon historical data, the projected annual workload is: (1) 30 non-GMP syntheses; (2) 3 GMP syntheses; (3) 1 medicinal chemistry project; (4) 100 shipments of inventory compounds; and (5) array and distribute 25-50 copies of plated compound sets.  This workload is variable from year to year, and the actual volume could range up to 50% higher or lower than these estimates.

The NIMH Chemical Synthesis and Drug Supply Program currently operates under a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC), which allows a deviation from the standard Patent Rights clause in FAR 52.227-14 to ensure the confidentiality and protect the intellectual property and patent rights of an investigator or party supplying a proprietary sample or composition of matter for synthesis through the program.  It is the intention of the Government to seek a continuation of that DEC to allow use the deviation in the currently proposed requirement.  

Any business or organization that believes it has the capability to fulfill this requirement should submit a brief narrative response (no more than 5-10 pages, single-spaced), indicating previous experience and capabilities related to each of the above task areas. Capability Statements should clearly state/describe: (1) the offerors experience and qualifications to perform this work; (2) description of the resources, equipment, available to perform this work; and (3) your type of business or organization, including: (a) size (number of employees); (b) management structure and history of your organization; and (c) your eligibility under 8(a) or other set-aside programs, as applicable (NIACS Code 541710, 500 employees).

PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME; THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. 
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT, NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO RECEIPT NOTICE WILL BE SENT TO THE SUBMITTER OF A CAPABILITY STATEMENT OR EVALUATION PROVIDED OF ANY RESPECTIVE CAPABILITY STATEMENT RECEIVED.

<DESC>General Information The Pacific Region-TRBO Region 12, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps medical treatment facilities in Hawaii, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Trocars - Disposable. This new RFRIAQ supersedes the previous solicitation for Trocars solicitation number W81K02-T-07-3016 which was posted on April 30, 2007, closed on May 21, 2007, and cancelled on June 14, 2007. The new closing date for this posting is July 23, 2007 and thi s date is established due to a chance in the clinical evaluation process. The change in the process includes a requirement for clinical in-servicing by the vendor prior to the clinical evaluation. All responses to this solicitation must be resubmitted fres h before the closing date of July 23, 2007. No prior submissions for this product line in any previous FBO will be considered or evaluated.  The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the D oD Prime Vendor Program.   The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, and the 121st Combat Support Hospital, Korea. This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreemen t (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a s upplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil The agreement will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of award with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is June 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determi ned utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria. Point of Contact Cheryl Janus, TRBO Clinical Analyst, 808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil B.	Products & Performance Required The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Trocars-Disposable. For this product line, the yearly estimated total usage/forecasted requirement for this region is $159,465.84. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales f or a 12-month period.  At the request of the Pacific Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information,  and itemization of brands, types of packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.  C.	Instructions to Offerors DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received prior to the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.   This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, on-site in-person in-servicing, product literature, education and training materials, and submission of electronic best price offers. Due to the potentia l for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC that their initial submission, quote, and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. Each submitting vendor is ad vised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.   D.	 Evaluation Criteria The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the deciding officials for this in itiative.   Phase I: Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of the tech nical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  	 Phase II:  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 15 business days to ship s amples. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the (15th) business day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a likert type scale, using a one to five rating. One is equal to not acceptable, Three point seven five is equal to acceptable, and five is equal to highly acceptable. All clinical/perform ance criteria are weighted equally.  The TPRB has set a 3.75 minimally acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable for standardization and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.  All vendors will be required to provide an on-site, in-person in-service to Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC), prior to the use of their Trocar - Disposable products. Vendors who cannot provide on-site, in-person in-servicing to TAMC will be disqualified.  The TPRBs rationale for in-servicing of this product group is in compliance with the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses Position Statement The role of the health care industry representative in the perioperative/invasive procedure setting (A ORN Recommended practices, and Guidelines, 2007). In-service is required to meet the governments minimum need and is normal and customary. Vendors will also be required to provide an on-site, in-person in-service to NH Guam, NH Yokosuka, NH Okinawa, and the 121st CSH OR vendors must send product literature, training aides and teaching materials to these MTFs prior to the clinical evaluation p rocess. Vendors who cannot provide on-site, in-person in-servicing OR product literature, training aides, and teaching materials will be disqualified. The TPRBs rationale for in-servicing of this product group is in compliance with the Association of periO perative Registered Nurses Position Statement The role of the health care industry representative in the perioperative/invasive procedure setting (AORN Recommended practices, and Guidelines, 2007). In-service is required to meet the governments minimum need and is normal and customary. The following steps are the on-site clinical evaluation process for Tripler Army Medical Center 1) Each vendor will provide on-site, in-person, in-servicing for a period of one week to TAMC. One vendor per week will be evaluated. 2) Day 1: vendor will prov ide  in-servicing to the operating room staff. A presentation reviewing the technical aspects of the device, the indications for use of the device, and how to use the device will be addressed. 3) Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be conducted. The vendor will  be available for any questions, consultations, or guidance regarding the product. 4) All vendors will be required to meet the standards of conduct in accordance with facility policies, local, state, and federal regulations. The following steps are the on-site clinical evaluation process for NH Guam, NH Yokosuka, NH Okinawa and the 121st CSH. 1) Each vendor will provide on-site, in person, in-servicing for a period of one week to the MTF. One vendor per week will be evaluated.  2) Day 1: vendor will provide in-servicing to the operating room staff. A presentation reviewing the technical aspects of the device, the indications for use of the device, and how to use the device will be addressed. 3) Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will  be conducted. The vendor will be available for any questions, consultations, or guidance regarding the product. 4) All vendors will be required to meet the standards of conduct in accordance with facility policies, local, state, and federal regulations. The following steps are the training aid clinical evaluation process for NH Guam, NH Yokosuka, NH Okinawa, and the 121st CSH. 1) Each vendor will provide product literature, training aides and teaching material prior to the clinical evaluation. 2) Day 1: t he staff will review all literature and teaching aides provided by a vendor. 3) Day 2-5: clinical evaluations will be conducted. Vendors will be available by telephone for questions, consultations and guidance. Phase III. After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who meet the minimum 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total  requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region. Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods  (not to exceed 5 years). Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.   1.

<DESC>United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Central Region Acquisition Division, (CRAD) is soliciting sources for Passive Acoustic Monitoring of North Atlantic Right Whales in the Southeastern United States 

The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972, is responsible for the management of marine mammal population.  The agency is mandated to conserve the endangered species under its jurisdiction and must undertake actions to prevent further decline of populations, facilitate their recovery and safeguard the quality of their habitat.  The population of right whales in the western North Atlantic is highly endangered.   NOAA Fisheries is proposing to continue a program to utilize autonomous passive monitoring devices to gather data on the presence of right whales in the southeast United States.  The objectives of this project are as follows:  1.  To obtain autonomous passive acoustic monitoring and notification buoys for deployment in the southeastern United States.  2.  The buoys will be deployed in right whale calving grounds in northern Florida and South Carolina during the period of 1 November 2007 thru April 2008.   3.  The monitoring system will provide real-time notification of right whale detections.   

The passive acoustic monitoring units require the following capabilities:  (1) the ability to record sounds in the frequency of right whale contact calls to digital media for underwater deployments of at least five (5) months.  (2)  Buoyant housings that can withstand water pressures at depths greater than 100 feet and sufficiently rugged to survive the high wave energy experienced along the mid-Atlantic continental shelf during the winter months. (3)  On-board systems to automatically identify right whale acoustic calls and notify land-based stations through cellular or satellite phone communication.  (4) Equipment necessary to communicate with land-based systems for display and monitoring of right whales contacts.

Historically, the equipment has been available from only one known source, Cornell University.  Interested firms shall provide, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; detailed descriptive literature of the products that it has provided previously for the same or similar effort, and a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications to supply the required passive acoustic monitoring units. Responses can be faxed to Charlene Yaple @ 816-274-6977 or sent via email to Charlene.A.Yaple@noaa.gov. 

 Central Region Acquisition Division, requires that all Contractors doing business with this officer be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  No award can be made to a company not registered in CCR.  For additional information to register in CCR, please access the following web site:  http://www.ccr.gov.

<SUBJECT>X -- PUBLIC NOTICE
<DESC>Public Notice
Notice is hereby given to the public of the U.S. General Service Administration?s (GSA?s) intent to enter into a lease agreement for space to be constructed for the use of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in Miramar, Florida.  The project will include 55,925 ANSI/BOMA office area with approximately 100 parking spaces for government use adjacent to the new building with additional 260 parking spaces either on-site or within close proximity.
 
The FAA is currently located at 8600 N.W. 36th Street, Miami, Florida under a lease which will expire on March 30, 2009, with termination rights upon 120 days notice.  This location is physically and functionally inadequate to meet the current needs of FAA as to interior space layout, configuration, and consolidation efforts of other FAA locations.  Additionally, FAA?s mission requires that its new office building be located in the delineated area identified herein in Miramar, Florida

The location of the project within the defined delineated area makes it susceptible to flooding at or above the 100-year flood level. As required by the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), GSA has already advertised FAA?s new space requirement within boundaries identified under SFO 6FL0191 in Miramar, Florida.  The boundaries established for this procurement were North: I-595; South: SR821; East: Florida Turnpike as it runs parallel to I-95; West: I-75.  This requirement was advertised in FedBizOps on February 28, 2007.  A market survey was conducted in response to the advertisement. Offers are being evaluated with an anticipated award within the next 6 weeks. 

Phil Youngberg, GSA?s Environmental Manager was contacted for input into the analysis of this project.  
 
Public comment is invited on any possible alternatives. Interested persons may obtain more detailed information about this action and its specific location from GSA, Ms. Pam Murphy, GSa contracting Officer, General Services Administration, 400 West Bay Street, Box 3, Jacksonville, Florida 32202 or by email at Pamela.murphy@gsa.gov.

The site preparation contracts for the other three MUOS ground stations are handled by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command and either have been competitively awarded already or are currently in the competitive award process.  Questions pertaining to this acquisition should be addressed via e-mail to: salvatore.cianci@navy.mil.  Numbered note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a Purchase Order to Sujit K Ghosh of Raleigh, NC.

By virtue, Professor Ghosh is uniquely qualified and capable of carrying out the requirement of this proposed purchase order.  The anticipated award date is 01 September 2007.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  Firms that believe they can provide this requirement are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification, as well as, a capability statement to the contracting office by 12:00 p.m. EST on 02 August 2007.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within its discretion.

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication or protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). (c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsman Mr. Michael R.

(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. (e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. (End of clause).
Also your quote must list your DUNS number, CAGE code, and Federal TIN with Company name, POC and phone number. If you need to obtain or renew a DUNS number or CAGE code, please visit www.ccr.gov.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.

VMware virtual software is currently being used throughout the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM).  The VMware virtual software allows all USCENTCOM users to have global access anytime anywhere.  It is designed with USCENTCOM mission-critical applications and environments.  To purchase another brand of software would mean forfeiting software currently valued over $400K and absorbing the costs and efforts (i.e., new software cost, time to employ new software program, and training of personnel) involved in procuring and implementing another virtual software program across the entire command.  It is not reasonable nor is it cost effective to purchase another software program when it too would require continual service and maintenance support.

Any other potential source would have to subcontract through AT&T in order to gain access to the existing infrastructure at significant additional cost to the Government for the same services.  

7.  Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable.  The Contracting Officer hereby determines the anticipated cost for this contract action will be fair and reasonable based upon a comparison of the current published commercial prices for the existing service and similar services recently contracted.  

8.  Description of Market Research.  Review of property data verifies that AT&T is the only company with required utility Right-of-Way and existing communications infrastructure to support this requirement.

9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition.  The CDP mission is to operate a Federal training facility to train and prepare emergency first responders to prevent, deter, respond to, and recover from terrorist acts or other hazardous events, especially those involving weapons of mass destruction and hazardous materials.  As a result of the recent transfer of the CDP into the FEMA structure, the NTF has been integrated into the CDP organization.  To ensure both day-to-day management and operations, and to support the execution of training, the NTF must be physically connected to the CDP IT network and IT infrastructure.  Essential support operations, emergency management, and mission communications require that all CDP staff and operations be hosted on one network.  That linkage must meet a critical DHS security requirement which necessitates point-to-point dedicated communications linkage with appropriate firewalls and encryption.  Failure to obtain the requested linkage and communication capability will inhibit training efforts, limit routine and emergency support operations, and marginalize the efficient use of staff and Government resources to accomplish the organization's critical training mission.

10.  A Listing of the Sources, if any, that Expressed, in Writing, any Interest in the Acquisition.  There are no other sources that have expressed an interest in this requirement.

11.  A Statement of the Actions, If Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition of Supplies or Services are Required.  Future technology may progress to the point that a means is developed to allow secure point-to-point transfer of data over the current non-physical medium of fiber or wire.  It is also possible that as the property between and around the CDP enclave further develops and additional potential users establish operations, another service provider may obtain a Right-of-Way and establish a communications infrastructure to support similar capabilities and be suited to host similar requirements.  

The Government intends to make an award to a single offeror who can provide all items identified and as specified herein. Successful offeror shall be the responsive responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) Price and price related factors (2) Delivery schedule. Inquiries and information received after the established deadline shall not be considered for this particular acquisition. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Only written responses will be accepted. E-mail responses must be in MS Word, Excel or PDF format. Technical and/or administrative questions must be submitted in writing to Charlotte.Laughlin@dhs.gov or Ella.Chapman@dhs.gov.  All responses to this notice shall be received no later than July 30, 2007, 4:00 p.m. Central Time (CT).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented, with additional information included in this notice.     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-18, effective on June 30, 2007.  This announcement is considered an unrestricted procurement.     The NAICS Code is 541611.

The center is located in Lawrence, Kansas and handles an estimated 850,000 calls annually 298,000 IVR, 552,000 CSR).  The center has been in operation for two and one-half years after a six month startup period.   The contact center employs approximately 50 full time customer service representatives.  Objective: CLIN 0001 Consulting Services $___________ :  The consultant will complete a study of alternatives to the NCC contract which meets the following objectives: layout three concepts of operational options to the current NCC contract covering both the business and technical components while utilizing industry best practices; provide detailed staffing, space and equipment/software/telecommunication costs (non-recurring and recurring) for a five year life-cycle; propose both a business and technical migration path for each option and make a recommendation supported by a technical and budget business case.  The Government believes, based on the current office locations, the three options to be studied should be: (1) a decentralized model with staffing/technology at our fifteen District Offices; (2) a time zone (follow the sun) model with staffing/technology at three locations; and (3) a centralized model at one location.  In all cases federal employees will be used to staff the operations in Government leased space (federal or commercial) and with Government furnished or leased equipment.  Suggestions will be considered.

<DESC>REQ1033014     Leafy Greens Aerial Photography

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 541922, identified as REQ1033014, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. Hard copies will only be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.

BACKGROUND

In numerous produce/leafy green outbreaks, four consistent risk factors have been identified.  These include:

?	Fecally contaminated water used for irrigation (wells, reservoirs, surface water), through mixing with water used to dilute pesticides, or through unintentional contact via flooding
?	Inappropriately composted manure used as fertilizer on growing fields
?	Direct fecal contamination of product in fields from domestic or wild animals or from runoff from domestic or wild animals proximate to growing fields
?	Fecal contamination from workers harvesting product  

However, regulators and industry members have not had objective data to begin to assess the prevalence and relative magnitude of the risks identified above.  A review of existing data along with two proposed projects could provide regulators and industry members with some objective estimates of the prevalence and relative magnitude of two of the above risk factors. 


STATEMENT OF WORK

The contractor shall work closely with the project officer throughout this project.

The contractor shall:

1.  Survey Animal Population:
?	To estimate the prevalence of contamination occurring through proximity to domestic or wild animals such as dairy cattle, beef cattle, or feral pigs, we are proposing an aerial survey of x square miles (to be determined) in two different geographic areas of California that grow leafy greens. 
?	Past experience has shown that satellite imagery is not of sufficient resolution, too expensive, not current, and not always available in various combinations. Given the short time line here we do not feel that we can overcome these satellite problems in time for this seasons? effort. 
?	These intensive assessments would review the likelihood of contamination of the leafy green fields by direct contact with livestock or wild animals and from runoff from fecally contaminated water from domestic or wild animals.


2.  Survey Water:
?	A second proposed project would be a systematic scientific evaluation of x agricultural wells (could also do reservoirs/holding ponds or do reservoirs/holding ponds instead of ag wells ? reservoirs and holding ponds could also be identified from the aerial surveys above) in two leafy green growing regions in California.  
?	Two to ten square mile (to be determined) areas would be identified and randomly selected blocks of land would be identified from these areas.  
?	Protocols would provide investigators with information on where to begin the visual search for ag wells/reservoirs/holding ponds in this selected block.  
?	Investigators would complete sanitary surveys of ag wells and collect water samples from the first ag well/holding pond/reservoir identified in this randomly selected block.  
?	Additional water samples from the selected ag wells/reservoir/holding ponds would be collected (monthly, every other month, quarterly). 


SERVICES REQUIRED

1)	Provide aerial photography/survey (fixed wing or rotor) of locations (leafy green producing fields and surrounding environment) as designated by FDA/CFSAN (or designee).  Number and duration of flights to be determined.  Specific locations (2-4 areas of a few square miles) will be determined prior to each flight, but will be within the central California area, as defined as all areas between a line North of Los Angeles east to the Nevada/Arizona border, and a line south of San Francisco east to the Nevada border (most likely Salinas Valley, San Bonito Valley and/or Central Valley agricultural areas.)
2)	Schedule (actual flight times and duration) of aerial photography survey will be determined as the project progresses, and by arrangement with the vendor, to be occasionally made within 24 hours of notification, but normally within 5 working days. 
3)	Allow an FDA employee to ?fly-along? as passenger to direct the location of the photo survey or outbreak, and to point out any areas of special interest that may need further photographing.
4)	Provide digital images (number determined during flight) of the location as designated by FDA.  All images provided to FDA will be as digital files sized at a minimum of 8? x 12? at 300 dpi minimum  All images will be made using a stabilized (gyro or stabilized lens) digital camera, with very high resolution imagery (minimum of 10 megapixels.)
5)	All digital images will be delivered to FDA by electronic delivery, as agreed to by FDA.  Acceptable delivery methods may include CDRom, DVD, Web access or FTP access, or other means as agreed.  Raw images will be delivered within 24 hours of flight.  Processed images will be delivered within a mutual accepted timeframe, but no later than 5 working days of flight.
6)	Aerial photography may include vertical (straight down) imagery that can be orthorectified for measurement purposes.
7)	Aerial photography will include low altitude, oblique (angled) views for close-up imagery of subjects
8)	All images will be required to include GPS coordinates (Geo location synchronization) to be contained (imbedded as stored data) as EXIF information in each image file, as well as date and time stamp of the photo.
9)	As designated by the FDA, selected images will be processed to be overlayed using Google Earth.  Vendor will deliver to FDA appropriate Google Earth ?KMZ? data file with processed images.
10)	All images (both raw and processed) obtained during the flight become the property of the US Government, and the Food and Drug Administration. Vendor agrees not to copyright or make available to any source without written authorization from the FDA

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-17.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all interested offerors may submit a quote.

This requirement is for the purchase of a High Energy Detector, Varian Model PAXSCAN 2520, modified to meet the technical needs of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), Neutron Imaging Facility.  

The Neutron Imaging Facility within the NIST/NCNR is a national resource which provides users from Industry, National Laboratories, and Academia the most advanced neutron radiography capabilities in the world.  In addition, the facility 
provides testing capabilities to users to test hydrogen fuel cells in situ with the neutron radiography capability.

The facility operates 24 hours a day 7 days a week during reactor cycles.  The Neutron Imaging Facility is used by NIST, as well as major automotive companies and other industries, for considerable amounts of proprietary and non-proprietary research.  Its major research partner, General Motors, relies on this system to function at a 100% level. 

A high energy detector functions within the Neutron Imaging Facility to capture neutron images to dynamically image water formed inside of a fuel cell at a rate of 30 images per second.  It is the heart of the Neutron Imaging Facility for fuel cell research.  


The existing PAXSCAN 2520 was purchased in 2004.  The PAXSCAN 2520 being purchased is an identical replacement of the existing system.  In the event of a failure of the existing system NIST would immediately utilize this system in its place while the damaged system is repaired or replaced.  Without this equipment the facility does not operate.  

NIST currently owns one backup system, however, this older system is no longer suitable as a backup due to its age.  NIST requires another one-to-one replacement that will perform at the same level as the existing system.  The PAXSCAN 2520 is the basis of the new high energy detector.

All interested quoters shall provide a quote for the following line items.  All equipment must be new.  Upon receipt NIST will immediately perform installation and testing of the equipment.  

LINE ITEM 0001:  Quantity one each PAXSCAN 2520, manufactured by Varian.  The PAXSCAN must be modified to meet all of the following technical requirements:

(1) The detector must be Varian Paxscan 2520 high energy detector.  If the detector is a low energy detector the Contractor shall convert the detector to an equivalent version of the Varian Paxscan 2520 high energy detector while maintaining the original manufacture?s warranty;

(2) The detector case must match the original high energy design with a ? inch-20 hole pattern the same as the original Varian Paxscan 2520 high energy detector.  The readout electronics must be properly shielded with lead, particularly the gate drivers.  Neutron shielding will be added later by NIST.  This configuration ensures that the readout electronics are external to receptor area to avoid direct exposure to incident beam; 

(3) Conversion screen changeable.  The Contractor shall mount a neutron-to-light converter screen on top of the amorphous silicon receptor in a light tight manner.  The converter screen shall be provided by NIST and will be optimally sized by NIST for the Paxscan 2520 receptor and may range in thickness from 0.5 mm to 1 mm thick;
  
(4) The converter screen must be held in place with thin aluminum or magnesium alloy windows.  A thin piece of foam may be used to apply pressure to mate the scintillator to the receptor; 

(5) There must be no plastic materials or poly-carbonate materials at any point upstream from the receptor, except for a very thin (less than 5 mm thick) section of foam as in Specification 3;.

(6) Detector package must be rated for high energy at 450 kV; 

(7) Must be compatible with and equivalent to fiber optic models of the Varian Paxscan 2520 DCDS 4.1 Receptor;

WARRANTY:  The Contractor shall provide the original manufactures (Varian) warranty for the equipment.  Warranty shall include all parts and labor. Warranty shall be on-site or return to vendor as deemed necessary by the Contractor.   If on-site, all travel costs shall be included in the warranty.  If return to vendor, all shipping charges and all responsibility for the shipments to and from NIST, shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.   		

Delivery shall be completed in accordance with the Contractor?s commercial schedule, however, all must be completed not later than six (6) months from the date of award.
		
Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination.  

FOB DESTINATION MEANS: The Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.

Award will be made to the Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price.  

Technical Capability, and Past Performance, when combined, are equal in importance to price.   

Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Technical capability shall be evaluated to determine: 

1. The Contractor?s understanding of the project and their ability to successfully complete the project;

2. The overall feasibility and risk of the proposed modification process; and

3. The ability of the proposed product to meet all minimum specifications.

Length?
There is no limit to the length of the platform. Just so long as it is at least 54". If longer platform allows for standard (off the shelf) lift then it is fine. There is plenty of space forward of the area.

Needs to have nonskid coating.

A weight capacity of under 6000 lbs is acceptable, but no less than 2000 lbs.

Fixed gate at bottom of lift can be attached to platform to allow for ramp.

The due date for quotations is hereby changed as follows: 
FROM: 3:30 PM Eastern Time on Thurday, July 19, 2007

Response is hereby provided to the following question submitted:

QUESTION: In response to our request for OEM pricing on the
2520 High Energy Panel, Varian indicated that NIST had provided the Neutron Scintillator direct to Varian for modification of the 2520HE panel (on a previous project).  In any case this presents a possible problem as the electronics could be folded out and shielded from the standard 2520 panel and the Neutron Scintillator installed via ourselves or other potential bidder, however this would void the Varian Warranty (LINE ITEM 0001 Para.(1)).  The current 2520V panel is shielded as standard for
225kVp and the Neutron Scintillator installed with full warranty.
I am not sure how to proceed unless the intent of the specification is that the bidder is to assume Varian's Warranty.

RESPONSE:  NIST is providing the Neutron Scintillator as a part of this project.  Reference Line Item 0001, Specification 3. With respect to the warranty requirements, reference the change below.

Line Item 0001, specification 1 is hereby changed to read as follows:
    FROM: (1) The detector must be Varian Paxscan 2520 high energy detector.  If the detector is a low energy detector the Contractor shall convert the detector to an equivalent version of the Varian Paxscan 2520 high energy detector while maintaining the original manufacture?s warranty;
    TO: (1) The detector must be Varian Paxscan 2520 high energy detector.  If the detector is a low energy detector the Contractor shall convert the detector to an equivalent version of the Varian Paxscan 2520 high energy detector;


WARRANTY is hereby changed to read as follows:
     FROM: The Contractor shall provide the original manufactures (Varian) warranty for the equipment.  Warranty shall include all parts and labor. Warranty shall be on-site or return to vendor as deemed necessary by the Contractor.   If on-site, all travel costs shall be included in the warranty.  If return to vendor, all shipping charges and all responsibility for the shipments to and from NIST, shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.                          
      TO:  The Contractor shall provide a one year warranty for the equipment.  The Contractor shall warranty that the equipment operate in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications for the PAXSCAN 2520.  Warranty shall include all parts and labor. Warranty shall be on-site or return to Contractor as deemed necessary by the Contractor.  If on-site, all travel costs shall be included in the warranty.  If return to vendor, all shipping charges and all responsibility for the shipments to and from NIST, shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.
