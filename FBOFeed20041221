Overall size of a High Volume Instrument shall not exceed a width of 4 feet, a tabletop height of 4 feet, and a length of 10 feet in a straight-line configuration.  The instrument shall be configured for operation other than in a straight line.  AMS must approve such configuration prior to delivery.  AMS may operate the instrument in the configuration it deems to its advantage.  The configuration of the overall system shall, in the judgment of AMS, lend itself to ease and practicality of operation in a high volume production environment.  The instrument shall be mounted on lockable casters that shall provide a minimum of 3 inches of clearance from the floor to the lowest point of the instrument.  This shall not interfere with the current instrumentation height as related to the tabletop and the sample eject.  The caster shall be submitted to AMS for approval.  All utility and communication connections must be inside the system’s cabinet.  Systems shall be designed to facilitate ease of disposal of waste sample portions and micronaire plugs.  Instrument shall contain a lid latch that protects the operator from dangerous machine components such as the sampler card cloth.  The lid latch shall latch upon lid closure and will require some type of vendor supplied universal tool for opening the lid latch.  A viewing window of the primary sample preparation and testing area shall be designed into any cabinet cover/hood.  All requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) shall be rigidly complied with by the systems provided under this contract. 

The HVI System (instrument) shall provide measurements of fiber length, fiber mean length, fiber length uniformity index, short fiber index, 1/8-inch gage fiber strength, micronaire reading, fiber color in reflectance and yellowness, and trashmeter percent area of trash and particle count and leaf grade and moisture content.  The moisture measurement shall be a single measurement and not require additional operator intervention.  The length and length uniformity measures shall be made by scanning a suitably prepared tapered beard and measuring, by the fibrogram method, the length equivalent to the staple standards to the nearest one-hundredth of an inch, the mean length to the nearest one-hundredth of an inch, and the fiber length uniformity index equivalent to the ratio of the mean length to upper half mean length expressed as a percentage and reported to the nearest one-tenth unit.  The instrument in maintenance mode shall output the fibrogram used to calculate the upper half mean length, mean length and fiber length uniformity index.  These data will be printed on an AMS supplied printer, connected directly to the instrument and/or displayed on the instrument’s LCD flat-panel display.  The fiber strength measurement shall be made on the same tapered beards used for the length measurement, with the jaws of the clamps spaced one-eighth inch apart.  The instrument shall output results in grams per tex to the nearest one-tenth unit.  

Instrument(s) in maintenance mode shall output force-extension (stress-strain) data.  These data will be printed on an AMS supplied printer connected directly to the instrument and/or displayed on the instrument’s LCD flat-panel display.

The brushing pressure shall be adjustable.  A device shall be provided with every 5 instruments to measure the brushing force applied to the sample.  This shall be an electronic device that is quickly connected to the instrument and provides a measurement of the force applied by the brush to a fabric material that shall be supplied by AMS.  The brush contact material shall be replaceable upon excessive wear.  A measurement of the normalized peak transducer force in kilograms shall be displayed on the instrument’s LCD flat-panel display in the maintenance mode.  Instrument(s) shall output the result to the nearest one-hundredth unit.

The micronaire chamber shall be adjusted using national fine threads and a dual locking nut system.  This shall provide a finer adjustment and a more secure lock on the micronaire chamber.

Colors shall be measured by illuminating a sample of cotton and measuring the percent reflectance and yellowness of a 10.5-square-inch area of the sample within +/- 1.0 square inches.  The length of the area measured shall not exceed 3.75 inches and the width of the area measured shall not be less than 2.75 inches.  Results will be reported in Hunter’s Rd to the nearest one-tenth unit and in +b to the nearest one-tenth unit.  Instrument(s) shall also output the color code for the Upland or American Pima grade and, for Upland grades, the quadrant of the color code.  The color grade reported by the instrument must conform to the Cotton Program’s HVI Color Grade Lookup Chart, which is based on the Rd and +b readings.  Instruments shall allow color and trash calibration checks while in production mode without changing menu screens.  Incandescent lighting shall not be used as the source of illumination for color and trash measurements.

Percent area of trash shall be measured on a minimum 9-square-inch area of the sample, within +/- 0.1 square inches.  The length of the area measured shall not exceed 3.75 inches and the width of the area measured shall not be less than 2.4 inches.  In order to eliminate fogging of the trashmeter lens filters, the trashmeter cameras shall be assembled without lens filters.  Trash measurements shall be made by a filterless video trashmeter and results will be reported in percent to the nearest one-tenth, except values greater that 5.0 will be reported as 5.0.  Instrument(s) in maintenance mode shall display and/or output the percent area of trash measurement to the nearest one-hundredth of a percent.

The trash particle count will be measured by the “cluster” method and reported to the nearest whole number.  A cluster is defined as a group of trash pixels connected on the same or adjacent scan lines.  A single piece of trash, regardless of its size, will have a cluster count of one.  Instrument(s) shall provide the option of either displaying or outputting this measurement, or both.

Instrument(s) shall have the capability of displaying and/or outputting leaf grade.

Trash:			In area and count to the numbers shown on the 
				Setup Calibration tiles.
	
The instrument system shall be calibrated to Universal HVI calibration cottons, USDA micronaire calibration orifices, and USDA color and trash tiles within the tolerances listed below for the corresponding quality factor:

Fiber length:  +/- 0.010 inch of the established value for the short and long calibration cotton and +/- 0.016 inch of the difference between the standard values for the short and long calibration cottons (spread or range).

Length uniformity:  +/- 1.0 units of the established value for the short and long calibration cottons and +/- 1.4 units of the difference between the standard values for the short and long calibration cottons (spread or range).

Fiber strength:  +/- 0.7 gram per tex of the established value for the strong and weak calibration cottons and +/- 1.2 grams per tex of the difference between the standard values for the strong and weak calibration cottons (spread or range).

Micronaire:  Instrument must calibrate to within +/- 0.02 on both high and low USDA micronaire calibration orifices.  After calibration, ten replications shall be made on the USDA micronaire chamber size calibration cotton.  The average must be within +/- 0.02 of the established value on the chamber cotton.   

Color reflectance and color yellowness (Rd and +b):  Instrument shall calibrate to within + 0.04 for Rd and within + 0.04 for +b of the USDA values on all five of the USDA tiles.  After calibration is complete, the central tile must read within + 0.04 for Rd and within + 0.04 for +b of the USDA values on this tile.

Trashmeter:   Tile slope and offset constants will be changed by manual entry only.  The only variable manipulated during trash calibration will be the threshold.  The calibration process will automatically iterate through threshold settings until the area measurement being made on the tile is as close as possible to the established area value.  At the end of the threshold calibration, the count measurement and the area measurement will be automatically compared to the established values.  The instrument shall calibrate to within + 0.02 percent area and within + 1 particle count of the USDA values on the USDA calibration tile.  Calibration results that are not within these tolerances will be highlighted on the calibration screen.

<DESC>This notice serves as a presolicitation notice/procurement synopsis for the AMRAAM AIM-120 future Lot buys (envisioned for Lots 20-24 (FY06-10)) production/sustainment program and software upgrade (SWUP) development.  The Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) Joint Systems Program Office, in preparation for its 20th production run of Air Intercept Missile (AIM)-120 missiles is envisioned to award sole source contract(s) for production/sustainment including Software Upgrade Program (SWUP)/System Improvement Program (SIP) (SWUP/SIP) for the AIM-120 variants.   SWUP/SIP includes the design, development, integration, and test improvements for production incorporation into the AIM-120 variants to maintain system effectiveness in future combat environments and Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR) of the AIM-120 System which must meet the requirements of the AMRAAM Missile Performance Specifications (MPS).  TSPR is defined as the contractor’s acceptance of responsibility to do what is necessary and sufficient to deliver, warrant, and support missiles that are affordable, combat capable, and readily available.  
Any solicitation/award is anticipated to either incorporate a Long Term Pricing Agreement (LTPA) or be discreetly priced for any/all supplies and services necessary for the production/sustainment of the AIM-120 missile.  The solicitation/award is expected to include a basic period (Lot 20/FY06), and four option periods (Lot 21/FY07, Lot 22/FY08, Lot 23/FY09, and Lot 24/FY10).  Specific production/sustainment requirements, in addition to the underlying TSPR concept, may include, but are not limited to:  AIM-120C7 and AIM-120D missiles (USAF/USN/USA/USMC), AIM-120 missile variants authorized for release to Foreign Military Sales (FMS), sustainment (including repair and a Service Life Prediction Program), associated spares, support/support items [i.e., program management/engineering/logistics/test support, support equipment, spares, (FMS) offset administration and associated data.  Total missile production is expected to be from a minimum of 300 up to a maximum of 900 missiles per year.  Deliveries:  Lot 20/FY06 begins Oct 07 at a rate of approximately 25 missiles per month; Lots 21/FY07, 22/FY08, 23/FY09, and 24/FY10 at rates of approximately 40 per month.  Sustainment requirements are anticipated to include a 1 lot repair capability for each missile lot buy, that covers non-warranted missile and support item repair for each 12 month period.  Inasmuch as Raytheon Company, the current producer and sustainment provider of the AIM-120 missiles is in current production, the JSPO will not be able to provide government property/government special tooling/special test equipment/technical data package to any prospective new source.  Therefore the fulfillment of the supplies/services listed above requires substantial initial investment and an extended period of preparation for manufacture.  Anticipated date of letter of solicitation for Lots 20 – 24 production and sustainment is on or about Feb 05; date of closing response is on or about Mar 05.  
This acquisition is contemplated sole source under authority of FAR 6.203-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements (10 USC 2304(c)(1)) to Raytheon Company, 1151 E Hermans Rd. P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Should your firm desire subcontracting opportunities, contact Mr. Tom Gillman (Raytheon Co.) at the above address or phone (520) 794-9794. The date for response to this synopsis for the AIM-120 PRODUCTION/ SUSTAINMENT PROGRAM is fifteen (15) days after the date of this synopsis publication.  Facsimile responses or requests to the Contracting Officer at (850) 882-8050 are authorized if you also call and verify receipt.  Communication concerning this acquisition should be directed to Ms Margie Naylor, Contract Specialist, (850) 883-0161, or Ms Dana Sillars, Contracting Officer at (850) 883-0152, AAC/YAK, 207 West D Ave, Suite 622, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6844.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a noncompetitive Request for Proposal (RFP) to Science Application International Corporation (SAIC), Huntsville, AL, for a "bridge" extension of the services being provided under Order H-35186D.  The contractor shall furnish the necessary management, labor, facilities, tools, and material (except as otherwise provided by the Government) to perform system analyses, trade studies, surveys, and other actions as required to identify and assess key technologies required for advanced in-space transportation systems/concepts/architectures and quantify the impacts for these technologies.  The period of performance for this "bridge" extension is March 1, 2005, through April 30, 2005, with the potential of three (3) additional 1-month extensions.  NASA/MSFC intends to acquire these services noncompetitively from SAIC pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii).  For this "bridge" period, provision of these highly specialized services from other than the incumbent contractor would result in (a) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirements and (b) substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through a second competition.  The extension described herein represents a "bridge" effort between the incumbent order (H-35186D) and a successor to be awarded as a result of a FAR 8.405 competition currently being conducted using FSS 871 (Professional Engineering Services).  Award of a successor order is planned during the period of this "bridge" extension to H-35186D.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 6, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253©(1) of the United States Code and FAR 
35.107, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology – Lincoln Laboratory of Lexington, MA for a pilot demonstration of the Biological Agent Correlation Tracker (BACTrack) program aimed at addressing the most pressing vulnerabilities associated with bio-defense technology.

MIT/LL is nationally recognized for system level work in National and Homeland Security as well as leadership in a number of key bio-defense technology efforts. In the area of Biodefense MIT/LL has lead a number of critical studies for the Department of Defense, developed leading edge technology items, and is a key technical team member in providing technical support for operational chemical and biological weapons defense for the Pentagon. In this particular effort MIT/LL will prepare for a demonstration of their novel BACTrack syndromic surveillance system including obtaining approval from requisite organization and review boards, selecting a target population, and preparation of software.

Over the past two years, Lincoln Laboratory has designed implementation methods and made performance estimates of the BACTrack system using line item funds. Lincoln Laboratory is a recognized expert in both the basic science and technical exploitation of system level chemical and biological defense. With both of these factors, the range of research capabilities and awareness of operational and system concepts for the BACTrack system cannot be duplicated without significant delay and additional cost to this effort.

The period of performance shall be four months from the date of award.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations and no solicitation package will be issued.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.    Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS

Synopsis:  PRESOLICITATION NOTICE

The Transportation Security Administration’s Office of Transportation Vetting and Credentialing (OTVC) intends to competitively seek offers to provide OTVC with the following:

1.	Credit Reports.  The contractor obtains credit reports on subjects of investigations from each of three national credit bureaus; the contractor edits the reports to eliminate redundant information; the contractor then structures the credit report so that like accounts are reported together (e.g., all collections associated with the original lends are located together, etc.); and, finally, the contractor identifies if the subject meets TSA’s financial suitability criteria.  When an individual does not meet TSA’s financial suitability criteria, the contractor prepares a draft letter for TSA’s use in notifying the person of the financial issues.

2.	Criminal History Checks.  The contractor is responsible for identifying and reporting all state, county, and local law enforcement records involving the subject for the most recent ten years.  The contractor is encouraged to use the most efficient and effective procedures available for obtaining these records.  If no other method is available, the contractor is responsible for physically obtaining the law enforcement records from courthouses serving the area(s) in which the subject has lived, worked, and attended educational institutions in the most recent ten years.

If the criminal record check identifies that the subject has one or more of 28 specific disqualifying offenses, the contractor drafts a letter for TSA’s use in notifying the subject of the issue(s).  

3.	Falsification Check.  The contractor identifies instance in which the subject’s responses to questions 23, 24, 27 – 29 on the SF 86, Questionnaire for National Security Positions, are inconsistent with the results of the subject’s credit report and criminal history check.  If so, the contractor reports the potential falsification issue by citing the SF 86 item and the report that contains the discrepant information.

4.	Electronic Reports.  The contractor is responsible for establishing an electronically accessible system, such as websites, for providing TSA with PIs and PI components that are organized by TSA regions and, within each region, by the results of the PI.

The Government currently anticipates the award of a single indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery type contract with a base period of performance and three additional one-year options.  
This solicitation will contain a source selection factor requiring large businesses to participate in the DHS Mentor-Protégé Program.  In order to receive credit under the source selection factor, the offeror must provide, with their proposal, a signed letter of mentor-protégé agreement approval from the DHS OSDBU.  Information on the DHS Mentor Protégé Program can be found on the DHS web site (www.dhs.gov) under "Business".

Special Requirements:  Each employee of the Contractor shall be a citizen of the United States of America, or an alien who has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence as evidenced by Alien Registration Receipt Card Form I-151, or who presents other evidence from the Immigration and Naturalization Service that employment will not affect his/her immigration status.

For all interested parties, additional information and a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) regarding this announcement will be issued on or about December 17, 2004.  All responsible vendors are encouraged to submit offers.  Competition for this procurement is full and open.

This incinerator system shall consist of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment that shall meet the technical and operational needs of the U.S. Navy or be modified to do so.

<DESC>The Intramural Research Program (IRP), National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Maryland at Baltimore, Maryland Psychiatric Research Center (MPRC) in Baltimore for a project entitled “Residential Research Support Services”.  We anticipate a 5-year cost reimbursement type contract with 5 1-year options for a residential clinical research program and medical treatment unit for individuals with a current dual diagnosis of mental illness and drug addiction.   The project will house and deliver support to people with psychiatric disorders.  Additionally, an established infrastructure is necessary to provide research support for acquisition, recording, storage and retrieval of research data for clinical research studies.  Trained staff, clinical infrastructure and support services to conduct clinical residential research and provide routine and consulting medical care is required. Also required is a Joint Commission of Accreditation of Healthcare Organization (JCAHO) certification which is necessary to conduct clinical research under good clinical practice guidelines as required by the NIH.  An appropriate shuttle/transportation service must be provided to move IRP residential research participants from the primary site to the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center campus, for imaging to be conducted at the NIDA/IRP PET facility.  A 5-mile radius is required from the primary site of service to the residential facility.  Also, an effective arrangement with an emergency care provider within the same radius is required for the safety of the participants.  The project requires extensive experience in the conduct of neuropsychiatric research, which includes therapeutic and non-therapeutic research with a focus on drug trials and neuroimaging.  


Statutory authority to justify this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in the FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source. See Numbered Note 22 and 26.

The extent of the Contractor's involvement with any given study may vary depending on the study design and support available in-house, through collaborators or other contracts.  For example, the Contractor might carry out only the surveillance and recruitment phase of a study, or only develop and administer study questionnaires.  Alternatively, the Contractor might only be involved in the treatment or sample collection phase of a study.  Some studies will require medical support for the initial subject evaluation, diagnoses, treatments, and follow-up care and this will involve providing medical personnel and facilities and/or interacting with medical personnel at other facilities including physician’s practices, clinics, and hospitals.  The medical institutions may be local or distant, and thus require travel by Contract personnel and/or study participants.  The Contractor might be required to coordinate activities with various reference laboratories, medical clinics or other institutions, and collaborators with NIEHS personnel.  Finally, all studies and/or tasks supported by this contract will be conducted according to all relevant federal guidelines and regulations.  Therefore, the Contractor will have knowledge and experience of all relevant guidelines and regulations for using human beings in research studies, e.g. 45 CFR 46 or the DHHS Common Rule, and those regulations for patient confidentiality such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1966 (HIPAA).

The Contractor shall furnish managerial, administrative, and direct labor to accomplish all work as required in the contract.  The Contractor shall support this effort with the appropriate infrastructure to provide for logistics support for its employees including housing, subsistence, and protection of the Contractor work force.  Anticipated performance is for one base year and four (4) one-year periods at the option of the Government.  Security services are required in Baghdad and may also be required in Basrah, Hillah, Kirkuk, and Mosul at the Government’s option.  Major duties and responsibilities are to perform access control to limit entry to only authorized personnel or visitors, and to operate walk-through metal detectors, hand-held detectors, electronic and hydraulic barriers, utilize working dogs and dog handlers for the detection of explosives or explosive devices and special monitoring devices.  This will be an armed program with weapons provided by the Government.

In accordance with 22 U.S.C. 4864, the Government will give preference in awarding this contract to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons and award the contract to the technically acceptable, responsible offeror with the lowest evaluated price.

A/LM/AQM intends to issue subject solicitation on or about November 22, 2004.  The closing date for receipt of initial offers shall be 60 days after release of the solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The single acq uisition will be executed in three phases:  1) an 18-month Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase, 2) a 6-month Firm-Fixed-Price option for the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Phase, and 3) 9 one-year Fixed  Price, Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity options for the Full Rate Production (FRP) Phase.  During the SDD phase, the selected contractor will be required to design and fabricate 8 prototype 60K IECUs to support Production Qualification Testing, Log istics Demonstration and a field user evaluation. If the LRIP option is exercised, the contractor will be required to deliver 60 LRIP units for First Article Testing.  The FRP phase will occur over a 9 year period and it is anticipated that a maximum of 9, 838 IECUs will be acquired during this phase.  The 60K IECU will be a replacement for the existing Army 54,000-Btu/hr ECU and the Air Force developed 66,000-Btu/hr Field Deployable Environmental Control Unit (FDECU).  The 60K IECU will be much lighter in w eight than these existing military standard ECUs which are currently used to provide environmental control capability to Force Provider, Deployable Medical Systems, Tactical Operations Centers, and other joint services including the Air Force.  The need fo r the lightweight 60K IECU is shared by all services especially the Army and Air Force who are striving to reduce the logistics footprint and increase system deployability.  Present and emerging command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, su rveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems require environmental control to moderate the environmental temperatures in which these systems operate.  The key performance driver and constraint for military systems today and in the future is system weight .  Additionally, the primary shortcoming is that refrigerants for existing military standard (MIL-STD) ECUs use ozone depleting hydro chlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), namely HCFC-22.   This ozone depleting chemical has been regulated according to a specific sch edule that prohibits its manufacture after 1 January 2010, and bans its use altogether by 1 January 2020 for servicing of existing equipment.  These phase-out dates occur much earlier in some allied nations where the U.S. Army must continue to operate.  Ad ditionally, existing MIL-STD ECUs are becoming increasingly unreliable due to lifecycle expiration and/or are no longer supportable by Army logistics and training systems.  MIL-STD ECUs and their associated components were designed to operate with ozone de pleting refrigerants and cannot be economically modified to accept environmentally friendly alternatives.  These ECUs in all sizes and configurations will not meet stated domestic legal requirements or international agreements and shall be used until no lo nger repairable and then replaced with the Family of IECUs.  A recent revalidation to the IECU ORD was approved that identified new requirements for 60K Btu/hr and 120K Btu/hr capacity IECU systems. Performance parameters set forth in the ORD include reduc ed power consumption, reduced weight/logistics footprint, increased reliability, compatible with current military shelter systems as drop-in replacement for MIL-SD ECUs including FDECU, elimination of ozone depleting refrigerants and designed to field an d sustainment level maintenance.  It is anticipated that the draft SOW and PD will be issued on the Interactive Business Opportunity Page (IBOP), https://abop.m onmouth.army.mil on or about 15 January 2005.  No hard copies or copies via email will be available.  Responses shall also be submitted via the IBOP.

Requirements are defined further in the Statement of Work (SOW).  The current version of the Statement of Work (SOW) is provided as a separate document under this Announcement/Screening Information Request1 (SIR1). This Announcement/SIR1 is to request information that will enable the FAA to make a screening decision to determine qualified firms that have the ability to perform these services.  Firms are to submit an FAA Business Declaration form with your response to this Announcement/SIR1 in order to determine if there are sufficient Small Businesses or 8(a) concerns that are determined qualified to perform these services.  The form is provided as a separate document under this Announcement/SIR1.   This acquisition will use streamlined acquisition procedures employing best practices for competitive negotiated procurements as authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) of 1997.  Offers will be evaluated and contract award made on the basis of "Best Value to the FAA".  The contract has a potential duration of five (5) years including a base year with four (4) 1-year options to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This, the initial phase, involves the Announcement/SIR1 of the requirement in order to permit companies an opportunity to express an interest in this requirement.  Only those firms that respond successfully to this announcement/SIR1 will be allowed to participate in the next phase.

The FAA reserves the right to contact references and verify each vendor's information.  Any statement included in a vendor's response that is verified by the FAA as either false or misleading will be cause for rejection.  All documentation is limited to 25 pages (8-1/2"x11", printed on one side).  Failure to comply with this page limitation may be cause for rejection of a vendor's response.  CAUTION: FAA evaluators will read only up to the page limit as specified.  Four copies are requested.  Mere statements of compliance or intention to comply are unacceptable.  All responses submitted must address the capability of the vendor to meet the special standards of responsibility.   SPECIAL STANDARDS OF RESPONSIBILITY: The following information must be addressed in each vendor's submission in order for the FAA to determine a vendor's eligibility to participate further in any subsequent SIR.

As  part of the internal review process for RFP+s, it has become evident that it is  in the best interest of both the Government and the offerors to change the  pricing structure of the contract to 5 years FFP and 5 years FP/EPA.  The  current constraints on NTE options would negatively impact both the flexibility  of the contract and the level of confidence in the out years.   If you have any questions or comments, please contact the contractual POC  listed below.

Because this information  could have a significant impact on potential solutions, it is being released  prior to the posting of the other questions and answers.   Changing from Alternating Current to Direct Current Seat Actuators for the T- 38C ESUP  This question was forwarded to OO-ALC/LCEA for their review and comment.  They  recommend we do not use DC actuators if at all possible.  The DC load is taxed  with the AUP upgrade and other changes are pending to add further loads to the  DC buss.  The change to DC would also require an aircraft rewire to add a  circuit breaker and cabling.  It would be less of an impact to use AC actuators  and a much simpler modification to the aircraft.  The present AC system has 5  amp circuit breakers.  If at one half the capacity of the 5 amp breaker (2.5  amps,) 2.5 X 115 volts=287.5 VA.  With DC of 28 volts equals 10 amps current  draw.  Conservatively, this is approximately one fifth the battery capacity.   Operation of both seats at the same time would further impact the battery  drain.

<SOLNBR>H92222-05-R-1120

<CONTACT>Charles  Bright, Contracting Officer, Phone 813-828-7322, Fax 813-828-7504, Email brightc@socom.mil
<DESC>This notice is hereby modified to provide clarification that two concurrent contract awards may be executed to meet the following ACTD requirements.  

The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC) of Huntsville, Alabama, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The Office of the Secretary of Defense has designated USSOCOM as the lead to an advanced concept technology demonstration (ACTD) of a semi-active laser (SAL) seeker based, standoff Precision Guided Munition (PGM) released from an AC-130.  The purpose of this ACTD is to demonstrate the military utility of such a capability, not to develop a SAL PGM for an AC-130 or to mandate a particular technology for any possible future production effort.  Additionally, the initiation of this ACTD does not mean that a formal program has been initiated.  Instead, if this ACTD is successful in that military utility is proven, then a formal program may be initiated.  If a formal program is later initiated, then other technologies that are currently less mature than the proposed technology for this ACTD or that do not meet the requirements of this ACTD might be possible solutions.  In contrast, without a successful ACTD, further pursuance of this type of technology on a Gunship platform by DoD might not occur at all.  The reason justifying the lack of competition is that NGC’s SAL guided Modified Brilliant Anti-armor Technology (BAT) Submunition, based on the fully developed, qualified, and fielded BAT submunition, is the only technology that currently meets the Department of Defense (DOD) ACTD guidelines for maturity, while addressing the unique capabilities required to successfully perform this ACTD.  With respect to the unique capabilities required for performance of this ACTD, the BAT submunition must have a SAL PGM, internal carriage that will not cause depressurizing the aircraft, adversely impacting the drag of the aircraft, and not exceeding 50 pounds per munition.  Moreover, the BAT submunition must have standoff range capability and allow variable time delay fuzing.  These unique capabilities are an integral part of this ACTD.  Award to other than NGC would not allow USSOCOM to meet the criteria to execute an ACTD and demonstrate military utility.  Additionally, the sole source to NGC is justified by the competitive nature of the OSD ACTD review and selection process.  This contractor submitted ACTD was the only one proposed which addressed incorporation of a previously developed munition onto the AC-130 to dramatically improve its warfighting capabilities.  Period of performance is for approximately three years.  The expected NAICS is 332993.  Any responsible source responding to this announcement must address the requirements of Note 22.  Specifically, a Note 22 response must show (1) that the proposed technology meets the technology readiness levels of this ACTD and (2) that the proposed technology has the unique capabilities required to perform this ACTD.  Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via facsimile to ((813) 828-7504) attention Mr. Charlie Bright or email to brightc@socom,mil

<DESC>ANNOUNCEMENT

TO:	   Prospective Proposers

RE:	   Lithuania: Klaipeda Port Security Technical Assistance
	   Reference No. 0470048A

SUBJECT:   Amendment to the Request for Proposals

DATE:	   Tuesday, December 21, 2004

This announcement serves to inform prospective proposers on the above-referenced project about amendments to the subject Request for Proposals (RFP).

Amendment No. 1:  The following supplemental background information is provided for clarification of Annex 5 Terms of Reference in the RFP.   

The following questions have arisen during the RFP process, which require clarification: (1) Task 1: “The review shall include the placement and installations of monitoring devices…”, is the contractor expected to install equipment or just review the existing installations?
 
Response: Task 1 states " ... review shall include placement and installations of monitoring devices..." The work shall only include a review of the installations. NO equipment is to be provided. Task 5a requires a report of the evaluation.

(2) Task 2: Are there two environmental tasks, one to assess the environmental impact of the Malku expansion development and another to determine the impact of the recommended security/information systems?  

Response: Task 2 – Concerning environmental aspects - The second paragraph requires recommendations for security equipment for the Malku area, and again does NOT require supply of any equipment. The third paragraph ONLY requires a review of the applicable environmental regulations and how, if at all, they will affect the implementation of security and IT systems. Task 5d requires a report based on this preliminary review of the regulations, and to make recommendations for elimination or abatement of adverse impacts, if any. 


(3) Task 3: Is a cargo tracking and management system a contractor deliverable or is an existing system being reviewed?

Response: Task 3 - Concerning a cargo tracking system - The Terms of Reference state a cargo tracking system is being developed under a separate contract. Task 3 requires the Contractor to review the existing VTS and operational procedures and coordinate his analysis and recommendations with the developer of the cargo tracking system.

(4) Task 4: Is the contractor responsible for conducting the training?  If so how many courses will be taught and in how many locations?  What language will the courses by taught in since the documents produced under this contract are required to be in English?

Response: Task 4 - Concerning training - The Contractor shall develop an appropriate training seminar for Facility Security Officers and include representatives of the Ministry, Port and terminal operators. The length of the seminar is to be proposed by the Contractor. Materials are to be developed and left with the participants. A budget allocation for ‘support and technical assistance’ is included for a translator and/or translation of key documents.

(5) Task 5: What is the degree of detail expected in the IT systems being recommended?  

Response: Task 5- Concerning the reports for the IT systems - Task 5c requires a report on the security aspects of the existing network and VTS, comparing them with other facilities. Security aspects require analysis and recommendations. Likewise for the IT system, the report is to include the analysis of Task 3 and recommendations of how to coordinate with the cargo tracking system developed under a separate contract. Recommendations made by the Contractor are to include equipment specifications and performance standards for software. The Contractor is to devise tests pertaining to firewall security so external users can interface with the overall IT system. The Contractor is to prepare recommendations and specifications to guide external users for establishing a safe connection.

Please be aware of the additional information provided in Amendment No. 1.

<SUBJECT>70--Development of Alternative Source Active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Prototype Transponder
<SOLNBR>W91QUZ-05-R-0002
<RESPDATE>011005
<ARCHDATE>03112005
<CONTACT>Janet Spaulding, 703-325-8727
<DESC>Sources Sought for Development of Alternative Source Active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Prototype Transponder  Follow-on Announcement Sources are being sought for the engineering development of an alternative source Active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Prototype Transponder product.   This Sources Sought announcement is a follow-on to a previous Sources Sought announcement that was published on 28 September 2004 with responses due on 15 October 2004.  In this current announcement, the Government is further defining the parameters of the  development effort.   The developed Prototype Transponder must have a mode of operation that complies with ANSI INCITS 256-2001, Parts 1, 2 and 4 (modified for an extended 22-bit Tag ID field) and also a mode of operation that complies with ISO 18000-7.  In addition to complyin g with these standards, the Prototype Transponder shall incorporate all other functions in order to be fully interoperable and backward compatible with currently fielded DOD Active RFID equipment purchased from RFID-II Contract DABL01-03-D-1002 (contract a nd specification information available at http://www.eis.army.mil/AIT/contracts/rfidii.asp).  The Prototype Transponder shall also be physically interoperable with existing interfaces, such as docking stations.  Interoperability will be verified against a test plan (which is not yet available) developed by an Independent Verification and Validation Contractor.  Development is to include, but is not limited to, electronic component design, air interface protocol, firmware, software, and physical form that ca n pass hazards of electromagnetic radiation to ordnance (HERO).  All items must be designed to operate in the worldwide physical environment of current and future DoD deployments. Specifically, the Government is considering a contract for prototype development and testing of required alternative source for Active RFID data rich transponders.  The current requirement for the active RFID data rich transponders, at a minimum, include b ut are not limited to a memory size of 128 Kbytes, unobstructed read distance of at least 300 feet, battery life of four years, and operate at an FCC approved 433.92 Mhz frequency.  Design and prototypes of handheld, fixed, and transportable interrogators (readers) and transponder writing stations, if determined necessary for development of alternative source, may also be required. For the purposes of this announcement, responders should assume that the Government will be unable to provide any GFE or GFI concerning the current Transponder design.  The Government notes the development and/or subsequent manufacture of the Alternative P rototype Transponder may involve the use of a United States patent.  The Government takes no position concerning the validity and scope of any claimed patent right.  While for the purposes of responding to this announcement, the Government neither authoriz es nor consents to the use or manufacture of any invention described in and covered by a United States patent, the Government anticipates the use of the Authorization and Consent Clause (FAR 52.227-1) but not the Patent Indemnity Clause (FAR 52.227-3) if a  solicitation for the development of an Alternative Prototype Transponder is issued.   The Government envisions development of the Alternative RFID Prototype Transponder proceeding in the following phases: (1) Engineering Breadboard  ANSI 256-2001 Mode; (2) Manufacturing Prototype, with commercially available discrete components, ANSI 256-2 001 Mode ; (3) Engineering Breadboard  dual ANSI 256-2001 Mode and ISO 18000-7 Mode; (4) Manufacturing Prototype, with commercially available discrete components, dual ANSI 256-2001 Mode and ISO 18000-7 Mode;  (5) Manufacturing Prototype, with custom desi gned electronics, dual ANSI 256-2001 Mode and ISO 18000-7 Mode.  The development contractor shall provide as an output at each of these development phases a product that is interop erable and backward compatible with currently fielded DOD Active RFID equipment as tested by the IV&V contractor. The Government requests a discussion of the technical approach, approximate timelines and approximate costs associated with the project phases outlined above.  If an existing product is proposed to be adapted to fulfill this requirement, the Government req uests a discussion of the technical tasks required to perform the adaptation and an estimate of their costs and duration.   The Government anticipates use of the DFARS 252.227-7013 and 252.227-7014 clauses in the solicitation and resulting contract.  In accordance with provisions in those clauses, and elsewhere in the solicitation and contract, the Government will require, at a  minimum, sufficient rights in data, such as manufacturing specifications and engineering drawings, to enable the Government to conduct a full and open competition for the manufacture of the alternative source active RFID product, as well as the making of subsequent changes to that product.  Under those clauses, it is anticipated that ownership of the data will, however, remain with the contractor.  It is anticipated that other solicitation and contract clauses will specify that title to the prototypes will  pass to the Government upon Government acceptance of them. Information regarding contractor capabilities and prior experience in the design, development, prototyping and testing of Active RFID transponder technologies and products is also sought.  Potential sources are requested to address any specification and de velopment issues, mail product information, if available, and identify Internet Web sites containing relevant information.   Potential sources are requested to provide their CAGE Code, type of business, e.g., small business, small disadvantaged business or a woman owned small business, veteran owned business, manufacturer, etc., and whether their firm is registered in the Centra l Contractor Registration (CCR) database (http://www.ccr.gov/).  Potential sources are requested to provide this information electronically to morie.gunter-henderson@itec4.army.mil, with cc to richard.mccunney@itec4.army.mil, and ronald.e.miller@us.army.mi l or mail information to: ITEC4, ATTN: SFCA-IT-A, Morie Gunter-Henderson, 2461 Eisenhower Avenue, Room 284, Alexandria, VA 22331 with a courtesy copy to AMC LOGSA P SCC, ATTN: AMXLS-AT (Mr. Miller), 11 Hap Arnold Blvd, Tobyhanna, PA 18466-5097.  Please inc lude the word PROTOTYPE in the email subject line.  Responses are due by 10 January 05.

<DESC>DESC: The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO-SCOTT) hereby issues the following Request For Information (RFI) regarding global real-time videoconferencing services.  
A.	PURPOSE: The Defense Information System Network (DISN) Video Service (DVS) Program Management Office seeks information for the provision of a global real- time videoconferencing service incorporating advanced technologies for the Department of Defense (DoD). The information gathered from this RFI will assist in the development of strategic alternatives for (a) future Request for Proposal(s).  The RFI is intended to gather information about the availability of technology/products in the market that will fulfill anticipated requirements for video, audio, and interactive graphics and includes other value-added elements. Information submitted in response to this RFI will become the property of DISA.  
B.	GENERAL: The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is seeking information regarding real-time videoconferencing services.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, DISA is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party’s expense.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  Small Businesses are encouraged to provide responses to this RFI in order to assist DISA in determining potential levels of competition available in the industry, as well as helping to establish a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract plan goal percentages.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the DISA contracting web page.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this RFI.  DISA will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. DISA will not pay for information provided, and is not liable for any costs incurred by the company in response to this RFI. General cost estimates are requested to assist in planning. Cost estimates provided will not be binding for the company. 
C.	BACKGROUND: Video Teleconferencing (VTC) is considered a critical element of DOD Command and Control (C2). The use of videoconferencing in day-to-day operations of the DoD includes Combatant Commands (COCOMs) execution of war plans and exercise plans, military training, simulation, and general unit command and operation. Regular system users include the National Command Authority and Military Service leaders. DISA is assigned responsibility for providing global video teleconferencing (VTC) capabilities for the Department of Defense (DoD) for command and control (C2). These services are separate from services for non-C2 functions. However, non-C2 VTC is integral to the DoD video service requirements and complementary to C2 VTC. The current video services contract includes video hub services to provide video, voice and data conferencing.  It also includes network bridging, speed matching, inter-hub bandwidth management, conference scheduling, conference set-up and control, security services including access controls, encryption and secure conferences, limited problem isolation, and other related services. The current contract does not include end-user equipment maintenance and support or customer conference room operations. Transmission and network bandwidth management is provided by other DISA managed contracts. A concept for an end-to-end videoconferencing system that provides both a reservation-less and reservation based capability is being considered.  This system is intended to include integrated real-time video and the possible future integration of voice, and data conferencing. This also includes streaming and storage of videoconference content.  DISN networks and their follow-on architecture will be the fundamental transport infrastructure for the new system and DOD end-users.  This includes both IP and circuit-switched networks of the DISN.  Inclusion of end-user conferencing systems is also being considered.  These may include studio, fixed, desktop, mobile and deployable systems and related installation or maintenance services. Over the life of the service, periodic technology insertions would be expected to maintain standards-based services and to incorporate emerging real-time conferencing and related technologies.
D.      DESIRED INFORMATION: DISA desires information on industry capabilities to support the services and features listed below.  This list is neither detailed nor all-inclusive, but is representative of the type of services DISA expects the real-time videoconferencing system to provide. DISA will consider responses to this request for information in defining requirements and alternatives. DISA is aware that some customization may be necessary to meet specific C2 requirements.  
FEATURES/REQUIREMENTS: 
1.	Support for integrated real-time video and future capabilities to include voice, and data conferencing.   
2.	Compliance with the latest Federal Telecommunications Recommendation for video teleconferencing including consideration for support of ITU recommendations for video including H.320, H.323, H.261, H.263, H.264, and H.239.  
3.	Consideration should be given to ITU recommendations for voice including G.711, G.722, G.723.1, and G.728.  
4.	Support for IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) developed Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). 
5.	Description of real-time data conferencing methodologies and standards used.  
6.	Support for conferencing among users on multiple network accesses including IP, T1, and ISDN.  
7.	Networks will include Defense Information Systems Network (DISN), Defense Switched Network (DSN), FTS2001, commercial ISDN, Secure IP Router Network (SIPRNet), and may include Nonsecure IP Router Network (NIPRNET).  
8.	Support for point-to-point and multi-point conferencing among diverse end-user systems including support for interactive, teleseminar, and telebroadcast services, with full duplex audio and video using a variety of compression standards in a single conference.  
9.	Provide for secure and non-secure audio add-on to videoconferences.
10.	Provide for one-way streaming of videoconferences.  
11.	Provide caching of videoconferencing content for remote retrieval.  
12.	Support for all forms of real-time videoconferencing applications: teleconference, teletraining, telemedicine, tele-maintenance and similar applications.  
13.	Provide a variety of conferencing equipment suites including configurations for studio, room, desktop, mobile, satellite and deployable environments and remote management of these. 
14.	Provide installation and maintenance options for customer premise equipment.
15.	 Interface with Allied host nation networks and standards.  
16.	Provide video and audio transcoding, video continuous presence and support variable data rates and speed matching. 
17.	Features to enhance reliability and survivability to support C2.  
18.	Support for classified conferences at different security levels including Unclassified, Sensitive But Unclassified, and Classified (up to and including Top Secret Collateral). 
19.	Incorporate an automated interactive scheduling and reservation system with worldwide accessibility.  
20.	Support for both on-demand and scheduled conferences. 
21.	Integrated system management including fault isolation and performance management.  
Detailed requirements will be promulgated in (a) future RFP(s).  DISA solicits information from industry about capabilities and services that can be supported as well as information about potentially qualified providers of these system capabilities.  This information will assist DISA in alternatives definition and system planning and budgeting.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability of small businesses to provide the NIH with dry ice (crushed, cut slab and block).  This is a request for interested firms with the capability of providing the required services to submit a capability statement for the purpose of determining whether or not this procurement will be set aside for small/small disadvantaged businesses.  The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 312113 with a size standard of 500 employees.  Dry Ice is a critical item for most, if not all, of the NIH research community.  The NIH research community depends on the NIH Central Stockroom to meet their needs by having dry ice delivered to them the next business day after it is ordered.  The Government anticipates soliciting an indefinite delivery (requirements) type contract.  Dry ice is used at the NIH for a number of different purposes to include; preservation and storage, transporting, cold temperature stabilization, related research preservation purposes as well as back-up in the event of power failure affecting refrigerated/freezer items.  Dry ice is ordered during normal business hours (five days a week).  Daily orders will be telephoned or faxed to the contractor by 3pm for delivery the following day.  Deliveries are to be made to locations specified on the daily order forms by 5am the following work day.  50,000 boxes of crushed ice and approximately 1,000 boxes of block slabs with boxes consisting of 50lbs (22.68 kg.) were ordered during fiscal year 2004.  There are approximately 60 NIH delivery points within the main campus and other NIH facilities within a 50-mile radius.  Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide (1) a capability statement demonstrating their experience and capability to fulfill the Government’s requirement.  Information submitted should include previous contracts performed including a brief description, dollar value, client’s name, address, telephone number, and name of contact and duration of contract and firm’s size and type of business (e.g., small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), Hub Zone, etc.).  Three copies of the capability statement  must be received at the address identified in the synopsis no later then 12 calendar days from date posted on Fed Biz Opps.  When utilizing a courier service, Federal Express, or UPS, the city, state and zip code MUST READ ROCKVILLE, MD 20852.  Responses via facsimile (FAX) WILL NOT be accepted.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether sufficient small businesses possess the capability to fulfill the Government’s requirement and to ensure competition under a set-aside acquisition.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice cancels and supersedes Sources Sought Notice NAAN6000-4-01422WJB.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a bureau operating within the Department of Commerce, has a requirement for one (1) a tail-mounted scanning dual-beam X-band research radar system to be used on NOAA’s Gulfstream G-IVSP aircraft.  NOAA presently anticipates award of a fixed price contract, with performance incentives, no later than September 2005.  The performance based contract will have a design phase with Preliminary and Critical Design Reviews, followed by a construction and installation phase.  The contract may also require the contractor to use earned value measurement and cost performance monitoring (EVM/CPM).  A NOAA/Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) paper “Vertically Scanning Doppler Radar for NOAA’s G-IV Aircraft – A Concept Paper”, written by Alan S. Goldstein, dated 2/26/2004, is available to interested firms through the NOAA Contracting Officer or Program Lead identified below.  

DESCRIPTION:  The aircraft is operated by NOAA’s Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) at MacDill Air Force Base, FL.  The Doppler radar system will be used to obtain detailed wind field and precipitation information for initialization of the National Weather Service (NWS) Hurricane Weather and Research Forecast (HWRF) computer model.  The Doppler weather radar system shall have the following characteristics: (1) a reflectivity accuracy of ~1dBZ; (2) a radial velocity accuracy of ~1 m/s; (3) a vertical resolution of 1 km; (4) a maximum horizontal unambiguous range of at least 50 km; (5) a maximum rotational rate of at least 10 rpm (60 degrees/sec) to provide target horizontal (along-track) data spacing resolution of no more than 1.5 km; (6) a maximum sampled gate length of 150 m; and (7) a total space displacement that permits it to fit within a new tail radome approximately 39 inches in diameter.  The Doppler radar system will interface with a data path and quality control system currently under development by NOAA.  In addition, a Government-provided stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) must be incorporated into the new tail radome enclosure.  The aircraft is FAA certified and maintains a valid airworthiness certificate. The installation of the tail radar unit will involve physical modification of the aircraft that will affect its flight characteristics and weight and balance. Such modifications must be accomplished in conformance with the original equipment manufacturer’s flight envelope specifications and must comply with FAA certification requirements for the specific aircraft type and mode of operation.  The modified G-IV aircraft is required to comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations in the Code Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14, Part 25, 14 CFR Part 36 and 14 CFR Part 91. The original equipment manufacturer has retained most rights in data for the aircraft.  Performance of this work must be accomplished so as to have as little impact as possible on availability of the G-IV aircraft to perform mandated hurricane, winter storm, and other meteorological reconnaissance and research. Windows of availability of the aircraft for modification and testing exist for 2-3 months in the late Spring, and 1-2 months in the late Fall of each year.  Delivery of the complete tail radar installation is required not later than July 2007. This requirement will provide for data collection and characterization by NOAA during the 2007 hurricane season, with full system certification and operational use in the 2008 hurricane season.  NOAA anticipates establishment of a ground mockup system at AOC in order to facilitate Doppler radar system testing and integration with the SFMR and data collection systems.


PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT:  In order to determine the most beneficial approach for acquisition of the Doppler tail radar system described above, NOAA is conducting market research to determine all available industry sources.  NOAA is particularly interested in identifying prime contractors and vendors who are small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, service disabled veteran owned, or HUBZONE qualified.  The contractor must be capable of providing the following types of support: (1) design, production and installation of the specified Doppler radar system including rack-mounted electronics, interconnecting cabling and waveguides, radome, and airframe structural modifications; (2) incorporation of the Government-provided SFMR in the new tail radome; (3) obtaining all required Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifications and inspections for modifications to the aircraft.  Installation of the data path and quality control system will be accomplished by the Government.  

SUBMITTING A RESPONSE:  Interested firms with capability to provide these products and services are invited to provide a written response to this request no later than 12:00 Noon local time, in Silver Spring, MD, on February 1, 2005.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Amended - FEMA National Radio System (FNARS)
<SOLNBR>SSC-Charleston_MKTSVY_246B2
<RESPDATE>123004
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Dennis J Walp, Contract Specialist,  843-218-5978
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Charleston (SSCC), Code 50 is tasked to procure, deliver and install high frequency (HF) radio communications equipment for the Federal Emergency Management Authority (FEMA).  This contract shall provide systems meeting all requirements specified in the solicitation. The FEMA National Radio System (FNARS) is a HF radio network which provides essential emergency communications capabilities between federal, state, and local governments during emergencies or disasters.  This system is regarded as a â€œfirst responderâ€ communications mechanism which may be used to maintain reliable long and short range radio communications with affected disaster areas without dependence upon more susceptible commercial terrestrial and satellite telecommunications networks. The FNARS upgrade will utilize Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) capability in accordance with MIL-STD-188.141B (2G) and frequency shift keying (FSK) capability in accordance with MIL-STD-188-110B. MIL-STD-188-141C (3G) ALE capability will be installed upon third generation availability. The FNARS HF system will be utilized to transmit and receive secure and non-secure voice and data. Data shall include, but not limited to, e-mail, text messages and images. Data rate requirements are expected to be range between 9,600 and 19,200 bauds per second (BPS). A typical FNARS system will include operator consoles, HF radio transmission and reception equipment, RF matrices and antennas.  A FEMA Ethernet switch and router will provide Network Control Center (NECOS), Federal Regional Center (FRC) and Regional Office (RO) system connectivity to the FEMA Wide Area Network (WAN) and will permit remote operation and control of these networked HF radio systems by NECOS, FRC or RO locations.  Remote control and operation of HF radio systems will be accomplished using networked desktop or laptop computers. State Emergency Operations Center (EOC) HF radio equipment will not be connected to the FEMA WAN initially but will require local area network (LAN) remote operation and control.  However, EOC radio equipment installations must be accomplished with the understanding that FEMA WAN connections may be required at some later date. Split-site HF systems may be required at some locations.  In these cases, the transmitter and receiver will not be co-located.  Therefore, for effective ALE operation, it will be necessary that the receiver and exciter be capable of remotely communicating with and controlling one another.  In many cases a co-located transmitter and receiver (transceiver) will be required due to lack of funding or installation real estate for HF equipment and/or associated antennas. Ideally each FNARS installation will have a two (or multi-) radio configuration.  One HF system would be utilized for voice communications and another HF system would be utilized for email and messaging communications.  This configuration would permit the exchange of both voice and data without interruption to either communications medium.  However, if a two radio installation is not possible due to either a lack of funding or real estate, an interface to preempt data traffic by higher priority voice traffic will be required. The HF radio equipment will include a Receiver/Exciter (for both combined and split systems), Automatic Link Establishment (ALE) and Link Quality Analysis (LQA), and will be adaptable to future Electronic Counter-Counter Measures (ECCM) waveforms.  The systems will conform to Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), MIL-STD-188.110B and STANAG 5066.  The equipment will include the ability to process 39 tone HF waveforms to ensure backward compatibility and current mission interoperability.  The transmitter subsystems will be configured with 400W (or 500W), 1kW, and 4kW power amplification, depending upon station location, propagation requirements, network interoperability requirements, and special operations.  The exact configuration will be determined by site survey, and network configuration. The 400/500W and 1kW systems must be contained in a single standard 72 inch high 19 inch wide rack but the 4kW systems may consist of two racks. At the Network Control Station (NECOS), FRCâ€™s and ROâ€™s, FNARS will use a modular, open system design to automatically operate and remotely control networked HF transmitter and receiver resources. This will include NECOS, FRC and RO systems at split site stations.  To achieve maximum flexibility the FNARS will use commercially available standards based operations, control and communications software and a multi-tasking operating system.  This will allow the station to operate â€œlights outâ€ (unmanned) and to be economically controlled from a central location if necessary. It is a requirement that the HF radio equipment be capable of operating with KY-99A, KY-100, VP-116, DTD (AN/CYZ-10), and KIV-7 HSB communications security (COMSEC) equipment. The HF radio equipment manufacturer must also be capable of providing responsive technical support on site or via telephone on an â€œas neededâ€ basis to either FEMA or SPAWAR Systems Center Charleston personnel.  The radios will available for use based on 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Technical support may be required at any time during the availability. See attached specifications. The contract will be an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, Firm -Fixed -Price (FFP) type contract. Period of performance will be one base year with four one-year options. The approximate value of the contract will be $28,000,000.00. Place of delivery will be to Government sites as directed by individual delivery orders. SEE NOTE 22

<SOLNBR>W911SG001IMA2
<RESPDATE>012005
<ARCHDATE>03212005
<CONTACT>Hugo White, 9155685521
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations paragraph 15.201 (e.), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. 1.   Purpose.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) in support of Ideas for Materiel Approaches (IMA) for an Army AMD Functional Solution Analysis (FSA).  The United States Army Air Defense Artillery School (USAADASCH) is leading a JCIDS analysis for th e Joint, Interagency, Multinational (JIM) Air and Missile Defense AMD Mission Area (JAMA) Study. As a part of the study, we are soliciting ideas for materiel approaches from industry to address the high priority capability gaps identified in a previously a ccomplished Functional Needs Analysis (FNA).  These overarching capability gaps are described in more detail in the following paragraph.   2.   Capability gaps.  There are five overarching capability gaps.  Your Ideas for Material Approaches submissions may address all, some or combinations of the components of these five overarching capability gaps.  Capability Gap 1. Cannot defeat the full spectrum of potential air and missile attacks on the US Homeland.  Capability  Gap 2 is AMD cannot completely defend COCOM designated critical assets against the array of potential ballistic missile (BM), cruise missile (CM), and rockets, artillery, and mortar (RAM) threats.  Capability Gap 3. Cannot adequately protect joint maneuver / maneuvering forces from reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition (RSTA) and the full array of potential aerial threats, including rockets, artillery and mortar (RAM) projectiles. Capability Gap 4.  Cannot effectively and/or efficiently integrate JIM AMD capabilities. Capability Gap 5.  Cannot readily deploy (inter-theater) or rapidly transport (intra-theater) theater missile defense systems in support of current and future force concepts of operations. 3.   Addressing Capability Gaps.  Materiel approaches can be recommended to fix (fully / partially solve) capability gaps at three levels, the system level (integrated solution for a major capability gap), the component level (a fix for a specific shortfal l described in the capability gap), or the functional level (a contributing capability but insufficient in and of itself to either fix a major capability gap or fix a specific shortfall within a capability gap). The following paragraphs describe the three levels: a.    System Level.  At the system level, materiel solutions may address a complete gap expression, e.g., Cannot completely defend COCOM designated critical assets against the array of potential ballistic missile (BM), cruise missile (CM) , and rockets, a rtillery, and mortar (RAM) threats.  When proposed at the system level, the materiel solution must holistically address all the specifics of the shortfall, e.g., an integrated system of sensor(s), command and control, and weapon(s) that will be capable of  integrating horizontally and vertically into the battlefield operational architecture.  When proposed at the capabilities gap level, the information sought as described in paragraph 6 below, should address each major element (sensor, command and control, and weapon) and then be rolled into a system summary. b.    Component Level.  At the component level, materiel solutions may be proposed that address components of the capabilities gap, but not the entire gap.  These may be proposed at an individual component level (e.g., sensor, command and control, or weapo n) or multi-component level.  Materiel solutions in this class of response must be capable of fixing a specific portion of the gap (e.g., insufficient identification or classification capabilities) or multiple specifics of the gap. 		c.    Functional Level.  Materiel solutions may be proposed that address functions that partially fix a specific portion of the gap (e.g., a wide-band, highly reliable, secure, jam-resistant, h igh capacity digital radio to partially fix the specific of the gap Incompatible, non-interoperable AMD C4I systems).   4.    Information Sought.  USAADASCH seeks information on potential materiel approaches / solutions.  Where multiple components are proposed, information should be provided at the component level and then aggregated at the system or multi-component level. An example of a response to the data call in a chart format will be sent upon request. The same type of information in a white paper format is acceptable. The IMA may include upgrades to current systems, procurement of joint or foreign system(s), or a prop osal for a new system or technology.  a.    Name and Description of the Capability.  The narrative should provide a short description of the materiel approach / solution proposed, identification of the capability gap or portion of the gap that the proposed materiel solution will fix, how the  proposed materiel solution fixes the gap or portion thereof, and a subjective assessment as to how well or how much of the gap or portion thereof would be fixed. b.    Technology Maturity and Technology Readiness Assessments.  An assessment of the maturity of the technology involved will enable an evaluation of the risk and programmatic efforts necessary to mature the technology and achieve an initial operational c apability (IOC) within the 2010-2020 timeframe. Respondents should address current Technology Readiness Level (TRL) assessments and explain in detail TRLs assessed as less than or equal to TRL 6. Additional explanations on the TRL will be sent upon request . c.    Anticipated Program Overview.  An estimate of the schedule and funding profile to complete development and testing of the materiel solution will enable an evaluation of the affordability of the proposed solution in the FY08 to FY13 POM.  For this est imate, respondents can assume that new money to develop the capability will be made available beginning in FY08.  An estimate of the procurement cost per unit will enable an assessment of the affordability to achieve IOC within the 2010-2020 timeframe and an assessment of the affordability of the procurement tail in the EPP.  d.    Other DOTLPF Impacts.  A broad assessment of impacts of the proposed materiel approaches / solution across the domains of doctrine, organization, training, leadership and education, personnel and facilities (DOTLPF) indicates whether or not the propo sed materiel solution can produce a meaningful military capability. Request respondents to this data call also include an initial abbreviated DOTLPF assessment. 5.    Analysis of Material Approaches (AMA).  In the AMA (third sub-step of the FSA), proposed materiel approaches will be evaluated by a team of operational and technical analysts.  Highest priority will be given to materiel solutions that appear to have the most utility (operational and cost effectiveness). 6.    Responses.  Information should be provided electronically in the form of a brief or a white paper as email attachments (return receipt requested) to provide the only indication of receipt. An example of a data call brief in response to this RFI is located in Solicitation W911SG001IMA2 (see ASFI Contract Opportunities). All briefs or white papers will be reviewed by the study team consisting of government personnel and their support contractors.  All information provided will be adequately protected.   Any proprietary information must be identified.  To be reviewed, the statement Releasable to Government Agencies and their supporting Contractors for Review Only must accompany any proprietary submission.  The government reserves the right to request f urther clarification or request presentations to enhance our understanding of the respondents submittal.  All briefs or white papers that fail to comply with the instructions or present ideas not pertinent to the gaps identified may not be reviewed. Respo nses to this request for information are request ed by 20 January 2005.  Please send responses or address questions to Mr. Chuck Vrahnos, Warfighting and Analysis Division, 915-568-6836 / 3160, DSN 978-6836 / 3160, email charles.vrahnos@bliss.army.mil or to Mr. Mark Boyle, 915-568-5535, DSN 978-5535, ema il boylem@bliss.army.mil.

ACA is seeking Capabilities St atements from HUBZone Small Business only.  The NAICS code is 541519; size standard is $21M.  Capability Statements should specify the services that can be provided and include your resource capabilities.  Capability package should demonstrate firms abili ty to perform the specific tasks that are being requested in the Statement of Work below: C.1 BACKGROUND The U.S. Army Development Test Command (DTC) headquarters is located at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, which is approximately 30 miles north of Baltimore City. Within DTC the directorates for Installation Management (IM) and Test and Technology (TT) have developed several computerized management systems, which automate facets of the core mission.  Automation has been applied specifically to RDTE investment strate gy, production base support investments, testing services, safety inspections, financial management, electronic storage of documents, and the presentation of funding requirements to higher headquarters.  This computerized automation takes on the form of la rge state-of-the-art database systems, which operate within a Local Area Network (LAN) environment.  Moreover, this automation is used not only by IM and TT, but by DTC Test Centers as well where data is shared over Wide Area Network (WAN).  While automati on has significantly reduced resources in many areas (processing information from test centers in many cases has been reduced from months to hours), upgrades, maintenance and new automation endeavors has strained HQ resources in areas that were not histori cally identified as main line functions. Critical missions of the TT are management of Department of Defense test programs being conducted by DTC test centers in support of safety assessments and system evaluations, management of the DTC program for the Virtual Proving Ground (VPG), development a nd utilization of over 600 Test Operations Procedures (TOPS) and International Test Operations Procedures (ITOPs), and to serve as the Army Test and Evaluation (ATEC) agent for international standardization of development and production test procedures.  A  second mission is the integration of new test technology into the DTC infrastructure through the execution of a dynamic test methodology program.  The results of research into new test methodology and test instrumentation are documented in an extensive li brary of methodology reports. And finally as testing resources diminish computer modeling and simulation play a larger role in the typical testing scenario.  The Directorate for Installation Management is responsible for Information Technology Management for DTC, the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the Local Area Network (LAN) at Headquarters DTC, and software engineering support for a variety of applications (investments, financials, information management, test support, etc.) in support of the overall mission for DTC.

<SUBJECT>NAVSEA Warfare Centers Small Business Web Site
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood the FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. In an effort to improve communication between the Small Business community and Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Warfare Centers' customers, a new Small Business Web site has been created.  The key element of the new Web site is the Small Business Tool, through which small businesses create profiles of their capabilities.   Prospective customers, including government technical and acquisition personnel and large businesses, will use the Small Business Tool to become aware of the small businesses' capabi! lities.  Unlike broader industry search tools, the business profiles created on the new site will be specific to the missions and requirements of the eight NAVSEA warfare centers.  Small Businesses that desire to create warfare center capability profiles and large businesses interested in using the site to identify small business subcontractors are invited to visit http://www.nswc.navy.mil/SBI/ to register.  A small business that is not familiar with NAVSEA warfare center requirements may preview them from this page to determine if registration is appropriate for that firm.  After registering, a small business will receive a password via e-mail and will then be able to log in and create a business profile.  Registered Government users and large businesses will be able to create watch lists for the capabilities they seek in prospective small business contractors and subcontractors.  IMPORTANT NOTE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES:  The site contains specific guidance on creating small bu! siness capability profiles.  Small businesses are cautioned to follow this guidance very carefully.  The goal is to populate the Small Business Tool with accurate and realistic profiles in order to efficiently match the capabilities and competencies of the Small Business Sector with the specific needs of the warfare center customers.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI), although not small businesses per se, represent a special focus group for federal procurements.  HBCU/MI organizations having the capability to support NAVSEA warfare center requirements are invited to register as small businesses. Questions or comments on the NAVSEA Warfare Center Small Business Web Site and its Small Business Tool may be submitted via the Feedback link on the site, or by email to DLGR_NSWC_Small_Biz@nmci-isf.com

The information in this Sources Sought notification is based on the best and most current information available to date. This information is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. Updated i nformation will be provided in subsequent synopsis, if required. The Joint Munitions Command is seeking sources for a potential requirement for planning, training, executing and managing the Command wide deployment of Transactional Lean Six Sigma. The inte nt is that a highly capable in-house LSS capability will be developed in order to grow and sustain a healthy LSS program within JMC well after contractor performance has been completed. Supply Chain Optimization (SCO) management consulting and facilitizati on in support of JMC SCO initiatives is also needed. The work to be performed will be at Headquarters JMC and five subordinate installations. The Defense Ammunition Center and the McAlester Army Ammunition Plan in McAlester, OK, Crane Army Ammunition Activ ity, Crane Indiana, Tooele Army Depot, Tooele, Utah and Blue Grass Army Ammunition Plant, Blue Grass, Kentucky.  We envision that the contractor will provide one Senior Black Belt to provide overall program management as well as multiple Black Belts to per form simultaneous training and deployment efforts at both the JMC Headquarters in Rock Island, Illinois and the subordinate installations. The objectives are to enable Command Wide Lean Six Sigma Deployment through 1) project leadership/completion, 2) coac hing/training in-house staff and 3) transitioning to self-sustainment.  A mix of classroom and hands-on effort is required. The requirement is expected to be implemented with a base year contract with up to four option years for full deployment. It is envi sioned that the amount of contractor involvement and support will decrease over the life of the contract as JMC employees become certified and take over administration of the effort.

<DESC>EDUCATION SUPPORT SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF THE AIR FORCE PROTOCOL COURSE:  The solicitation number is FA8601-05-T-0036.  The proposed contract is for  performance period of  approximately 10 Jan 05 – 25 Jun 05.  The government  intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of  FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  The proposed source is Matters of Protocol, Alexandria,  VA.  The government anticipates a sole source award to Matters of Protocol for  educational services to assist the Air Force Institute of Technology in its  support of the Air Force Protocol Course educational program.  The course  material requires years of experience to effectively deliver, given its highly  interactive and scenario based execution.  A sole source award is anticipated  because Matters of Protocol was instrumental in the design and development of  all course material and has many years of protocol experience from Base level  to the Office of the Secretary of Defense.  This notice of intent is not a  request for competitive quotations; however, any quotation received within  fifteen (15) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the  government.

SUPERVISION

The Office Director of DCHA/FFP and Emergency Division Chief provides policy and general direction.  The incumbent functions as a part of a geographic team led by the Team Leader, working independently on implementing projects, coordinating with other office, agency or interagency personnel and backstopping other team members as needed.  Project accomplishments are reviewed for compliance with broad Title II legislation, A.I.D. policy and responsiveness to DCHA/FFP programs and Bureau strategic objectives.

EDUCATION/EXPERIENCE REQUIRED FOR THIS POSITION

A four year degree from a U.S. institution (preferably in humanitarian response, international relations or development, public administration, food security/nutrition, or related field), and at least three years of related work experience is required.  Relevant Master's Degree and/or field experience desirable.

GUIDELINES

Guidelines consist of Title II laws and legislative initiatives and Agency and Bureau rules and regulations, governing the use of the U.S. food assistance.  Incumbent must exercise considerable judgment in determining the application of current legislative provisions and executive policies to assigned responsibilities.  Given the unique emergency requirements inherent in the majority of the regions of the world, the incumbent is expected to be innovative and original in formulating new or improved approaches to problem resolution, including the initiation of actions that may result in new policy. 

COMPLEXITY

The work requires the application of extensive knowledge of planning and developing emergency food aid programs.  Issues are often characterized by unusual demands of the vital role that food aid plays in meeting the emergency and short-range needs of the hungry.  Incumbent evaluates and interprets policies and projects, develops a range of alternatives for the solution of policy problems, and coordinates the work with other professionals in the accomplishment of several phases of complex projects concurrently and sequentially.  The necessary analytical skills require full awareness of food aid program complexities with changing economic, social and programmatic circumstances in which the efficient use of resources remain under constant review and assessment.

SCOPE AND EFFECT

The purpose of the work is to meet the nutritional needs of targeted, vulnerable groups, or to plan and manage responses for USAID¡¦s worldwide food assistance program to combat hunger.  The position requires a high degree of initiative, originality, foresight and judgment to assure attention to policy and effective implementation of the purposes of P.L. 480.  The incumbent provides senior DCHA and USAID management with the basis for decisions affecting major current DCHA/FFP projects that affect the U.S. Government¡¦s effort to combat hunger abroad.

PERSONAL CONTACTS

The incumbent develops and maintains close contact with senior level USAID personnel; Bureau and Agency staff; other U.S. Government agencies; and the U.N. agencies.  Incumbent works with private voluntary organizations and officials of foreign governments.  Some contacts with specific individuals are recurrent since the incumbent functions in a coordinating capacity to convey policy and discern policy differences.  Other contacts may be characterized by their unstructured settings and by the flexibility of approach and breadth of subject matter.

PURPOSE OF CONTACTS

The purpose of contacts is to direct USAID¡¦s food assistance programs, provide guidelines and procedures for responses to specific countries suffering from natural disaster or civil strife; and to provide technical guidance in identifying, developing and monitoring emergency food aid programs.

WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  The position is based in Washington D.C. with travel as required.  The requirement for field trips to visit food aid programs may expose the incumbent to difficult working surroundings and security risks.
Historically, the FFP Officer has been required to travel 3-5 times a year for a total duration of 5 to 10 weeks.  However, travel may vary depending on the requirement and the situation in the countries covered by the selected candidate.

SECURITY CLEARANCE 

This position requires the ability to obtain a SECRET security clearance.  Person must be a U.S. citizen to obtain a security clearance.
