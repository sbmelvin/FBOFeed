The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS) Acquisitions Office intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with American Medical Depot, a minority-owned, small business, 10315 Usa Today Way, Miramar, FL 33025, for the procurement of Stryker Scopes for the VA UD Medical Center, University Drive C, Pittsburgh, PA 15240.  Items to be procured include arthroscopes, obturators, cannulas, pencil obturators, cameras and mounts.

This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 (only 1 responsible source) because the Government believes that American Medical Depot is the only company able to provide Stryker components such as these.  Stryker components are required because the existing systems are Stryker and there is a full-compatibility requirement.

This notice of intent is not for competitive quotes. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) number is 339113, small business size standard of 750 employees. This notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document is available.  However, parties may express their interest accompanied by supporting literature by email to Jeff Greis, Contracting Officer, no later than September 26, 2016 at 1300 ET.  Responses should be sent to jeffrey.greis@va.gov.   No telephone responses will be accepted.  Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement or proceed with a sole-source procurement.  The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the VAPHS Contracting Officer.

Please include your socioeconomic status (i.e., SDVOSB, small business, etc.) and DUNS numbers in your responses.

      (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
      (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
    (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

  (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)

The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price.

The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights-
    (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and
    (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

      (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
      (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
    (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price.

The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights-
    (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and
    (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

  (u) Unauthorized Obligations.
    (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:

      (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

    (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

<DESC>The Purpose of Amendment A0001 is to post all the Questions and Answers generated from Solicitation Number: VA786-16-R-0386.

Question 1: We are Interested in pursuing solicitation #VA786-16-R-0386 and been reading over the solicitation. Is the $30,000.00 magnitude of  construction the total range for the entire project? 
Also, if the duration of project is 60 calendar days and there is no work to be performed on weekends or federal holidays, then the duration of project is shorter than 60 days. 
Answer 1: Yes, the $30,000.00 is the projected magnitude construction total - however that doesn't preclude anyone from exceeding it in their proposal.
Work on weekends is something that can be worked out with the COR if he deems it necessary. Federal employees don't work on holidays therefore holidays are no work days.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs intends to solicit and negotiate a Sole Source, Firm-Fixed-Price Purchase Order with Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., of Redmond, Washington.  The VA Portland Health Care System has a requirement for a Hemoglobin AIC Testing System reagent rental agreement.  The desired system will be used to measure HB/A1c without interference from common hemoglobin variants. 
Market research has been conducted, and other systems were tested, but there are several facility requirements that only the Bio-Rad system has the capability to meet:
1)	The facility requires a sample throughput of at least 80 tests per hour.  
2)	The system must be immediately available for implementation to the VA's VISTA computerized hospital information system, with on-board storing patient information including chromatographs in compliance with a VA mandate for no paper records of test results.  The facility does not have the space for a separate storage solution in the laboratory.

This notice is not a solicitation for offers.  If there are parties interested in further information please notify the contracting officer (information below) by 5:00 PM EDT, September 28th, 2016.  All information furnished must be in writing by email and must contain sufficient detail to allow the VA Portland Heath Care System to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.
This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325413, In-Vitro Diagnostic Substance Manufacturing, and the business size standard is 500 employees.
This requirement is for:    				Contracting Officer:
Department of Veterans Affairs			Greg Wilde
Portland VA Medical Center				Gregory.wilde1@va.gov
3710 SW US Veterans Hospital Rd
Portland, OR 97239

This notice satisfies the requirement at FAR 5.201(b)(1), to publicize the proposed contract action.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation will be made available. Any responses received will only be considered for the purposes of determining the market place for future procurements and whether to conduct a competitive procurement in lieu of sole source contract described in this notice, and such determination shall be made at the sole discretion of the Government.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement.  The Government will not pay for information submitted.  This will be the only notice of the Government's intent to solicit, negotiate, and award to one source to satisfy this requirement.
