<CONTACT>Tess Klatt, Small Business Advocate, Phone 509-372-9522, Email tess.klatt@wch-rcc.com
<DESC>Subcontract Description
116-N &184-N Explosive Demolition:

Washington Closure Hanford (WCH) is seeking qualified subcontractors to provide demolition services to the River Corridor Closure. WCH is a prime contractor to the Department of Energy at Richland WA. 

WCH intends to award a minimum of two master agreements for explosive demolition services to support the RCC contract. WCH strongly encourages small businesses to participate and encourages teaming arrangements to meet the qualification criteria. WCH will determine (following review of the prequalification questionnaires) if the RFP will be set- aside for small businesses.

Description of Work:

The 116-N Stack and 184-N Powerhouse are located within the Hanford Site in the 100-N Area on the south bank of the Columbia River.  Approximately 38 river miles upstream and 32 road miles from the city of Richland, in the southeastern corner of Washington state.

116-N:

The 116-N Exhaust Air Stack (also called the Ventilation Stack) is a reinforced, monolithic, 69.5-m (228-ft) tall concrete structure that discharges ventilation exhaust to the atmosphere.  It stands on an octangular-shaped below-grade base that measures 1.4-m (4.5-ft) in height and 10.2-m (33.5-ft) across.  Top of stack is 61-m (200-ft) above grade.  It is fed by a below-grade air exhaust tunnel that originates in the 117-N Exhaust Air Filter House.

SUBCONTRACTOR shall be responsible for explosive demolition of the above-grade portion of the stack to include mobilization, dust and fragment projectile controls, drilling, falling the stack to a predetermined location, waste handling (excluding demolition rubble), demobilization, and other work necessary to demolish the 116-N in accordance with this contract. The CONTRACTOR will remove demolition rubble.

184-N:
The 184-N consists of 4 attached structures; the 184 N Power House, the 184 NA Power House annex, the 184-NE compressed gas sheds, and the 184 NF chemical injection pump room.

The 184 N Power House is a 34 m by 29 m by 21 m (112 ft by 96 ft by 70 ft) reinforced-concrete and structural steel building with channeled steel siding on the above-grade portions of the facility.  There is a steel stack 21-m (70-ft) in height from the 17-m (56-ft) roof level.  The facility housed a 15,000 kilowatt turbine generator that was driven by reactor generated steam or by a 575,000 Btu/hr boiler contained in the facility or by associated auxiliary equipment, air compressors, and compressed air receivers.  Chemicals used for water quality control were stored in the facility, and contamination of the facility occurred from pump/equipment leaks.  There is an adjacent facility approximately 15-m (50-ft) to the west.

The 184 NA Power House annex is a 418.5 m2 (4,500 ft2) metal on metal frame building that housed two boilers serving as backups to the main boiler in the 184 N Facility.  The structure shares a common wall with the 184 N Building on the west side.  The boiler steam drums and piping received radioactive contamination from recirculated reactor secondary system water.  East of the 184-NA is an associated steel stack that extends from grade to a height of approximately 24-m (80-ft).  There is an adjacent active power line approximately 13-m (40-ft) east of the stack.

The 184-NE compressed gas sheds consist of two small sheds each approximately 7-m2 (75-ft2) used to store compressed gas cylinders.  Gas piping ran from the gas cylinders inside the sheds into the 184-N Power House.  The sheds share a common wall with the 184 N Power House and are located on the south side of 184-N.  

The 184 NF chemical injection pump is within an approximately 9-m2 (96-ft2) pre engineered, single story steel frame building with metal siding and roofing.  The facility housed the aqueous ammonia injection system that injected ammonia for water quality into the 109 N Facility?s secondary water system.  

SUBCONTRACTOR shall be responsible for building implosion, felling the stacks, fracturing concrete foundations and pedestals, and large component size reduction of the 184-N, to include mobilization, dust and fragment projectile controls, drilling, waste handling (excluding demolition rubble), demobilization, and other work necessary to implode the 184-N, fell the stacks, size reduce specified components, and fracture heavy concrete material into no larger than 0.9m (3ft) in dimension in accordance with this contract. The CONTRACTOR will remove demolition rubble.
:::
Construction drawings for 116-N and 184-N will be provided as part of the subcontract documents.  The primary pay item within the Subcontract will be lump sum. The subcontractor will be expected to provide a full-time on-site site superintendent, a full-time on-site health and safety/IH representative, and a project manager.  The subcontractor will also be expected to have engineering resources available.

<CONTACT>Sarah L. Hartman 215-697-6519
<DESC>P/N C1001A9017-1 Receiver Communication (CCS) The Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) Philadelphia, PA will be soliciting a proposal for spares and repair of repairable (ROR) support of the E/A-18G Aircraft. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, MD will be soliciting a proposal for E/A-18G Aircraft Support Equipment (SE) hardware and non-recurring engineering and logistics support; including, but not limited to, technical publications, technical data, and provisioning data. The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Boeing Company (MDC/Boeing) will be solicited for both requirements via the FIRST (F/A-18 Integrated Readiness Support Team) program.  The FIRST Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract provides spares availability, asset repair management, engineering support, and integrated logistics support (ILS) of all F/A-18 Aircraft variants. The FIRST program demands aggressive pursuit of system reliability improvements through effective configuration and obsolescence management, technology insertion, and innovative product and support improvements. Various operational and repair sites are supported. MDC/Boeing is also required to maintain CORE capability I/A/W U.S. Code 10 U.S.C 2464 through depot teaming arrangements with the NADEPs in North Island, Cherry Point, and Jacksonville under FIRST. A teaming arrangement may be required with Crane, Indiana as well for repair of E/A-18 G systems.  The estimated $ value of the EA-18 G spares, ROR and SE requirements for the remainder of the existing FIRST contract performance period (through FY10) is expected to exceed $250,000,000.00. The EA-18 G requirement is restricted to MDC/Boeing, the aircraft prime manufacturer, because MDC/Boeing is the only source that possesses the full range of technical data, much of which is proprietary, and other capabilities necessary to perform the effort. Further, MDC/Boeing is considered to be the only source that is capable of providing the required range of integrated program support. See Note 22*****

Around the periphery of the stand and/or mounted on the test cell walls are support systems and ancillary equipment and hardware.  The current HDS test stand does not have a test article installation envelope nor the power absorption capability for testing the drive systems for new and upgraded weapons systems, such as the CH53K, AH1W/Z, VH-71A, and AH64D helicopters.  The Government has created design changes to the HDS test cell and test stand to support the above test and evaluation requirements.  The resulting design is a larger and stronger test stand, capable of withstanding the CH53K torque loads; a wide open test article installation envelope; a modular system to facilitate faster installation and removal of the varying engine drive systems; and a larger power absorption speed increasing gearbox.  The test stand will also have a new torque measurement system and will reutilize the existing thrust load and shaft bending capability.

The Government will remove all test articles, test specific instrumentation, tail rotor stand, and main water brakes, and will clear the work performance area of benches, tool boxes, etc.  In general, the contractor will be responsible to:  1) provide all labor, subcontracts, services and materials necessary to dismantle the existing HDS test stand system, store or dispose of various items, and fabricate, assemble and install the new HDS test stand system in accordance with the Government-approved design and technical data package (GFI); 2) install the Gateway Engineering Inc. 18,500 shaft horsepower absorption gearbox (GFE); and 3) purchase and install the engine drive system, intermediate gearbox, tail rotor bedplates, and a 500,000 foot-pound torque measurement system.  The contractor will be required to reattach cable trays and control panel boxes to the new test stand, reconnect power cords to equipment and control systems on the test stand, and integrate modifications made to the test stand with existing HDS facility systems and subsystems.  The contractor will also provide technical data.

No group or individual site visit at the HDS test stand location will be scheduled or authorized.  With the Request for Proposal (RFP), the Government will provide a 100% complete design and technical data package on CD-ROM that contains detailed information about the site and the requirement.  The Government anticipates issuing the solicitation for this requirement on or about 4 January 2007 with a sixty (60) day response period for receipt of proposals.  Interested Offerors may access the solicitation at that time on the following website:  http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

IT IS THE INTENT OF THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT FOR TACTICAL AND NON-TACTICAL INTEGRATED FAMILY OF TEST EQUIPMENT (IFTE) BASE SHOP TEST FACILITY (BSTF)/COMMERCIAL EQUIVALENT EQUIPMENT (CEE)/ELECTRO-OPTICS TEST STATION (EOTS)/ELECTRO-OPTICS TEST FACI LITY (EOTF)/NEXT GENERATION AUTOMATED TEST SYSTEM (NGATS) REPAIR AND RETURN OF SECONDARY ITEMS AND SPARES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2007 THROUGH FY 2011, by other than full and open competition from NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION, 600 HICKS ROAD, ROOM H6071, ROLLING M EADOWS, IL 60008-1098, (CAGE CODE 26916).  The Government plans to set this follow-on contract up similarly to the existing contract DAAH01-02-D-0004.  The new contract will be a five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract.  The repair and r eturn portion of this contract is planned to be an IDIQ Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee.  The Government plans to procure a loaded hourly rate, which will include estimated material, all overheads, general and administrative costs and a fixed fee.  The repair and retu rn contract line number will have a maximum ceiling for hours.  The spares catalog portion of this contract is planned to be an IDIQ Firm-Fixed-Price with negotiated terms and conditions allowing orders for spares to be placed on the contract.  The repair portion of this contract cannot be adequately defined to develop a fixed price as there are various levels of repair required.  On the other hand, the spares portion can be adequately defined in order to develop a fixed price arrangement that is fair and r easonable. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Northrop Grumman Corp.  Suggest that small business firms, or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with this procurement, make contact with the firm (s) listed.

The contractor shall establish and operate in the contractor's name, the food service facilities at the Department of Labor, Frances Perkins Building, 6th Floor, 200 Constitution Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20210.   The Frances Perkins Building has approximately 37,000 square feet of space.

The Government will make an award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the RFP and is most advantageous to the Government.   The RFP issue date will be on or about January 9, 2006 with a closing date of February 15, 2006.  All interested parties should request a copy of the complete RFP from Cynthia Brown, Contract Specialist on 202-219-3094. This synopsis is a commercial items acquisition and is in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information contained in the Request for Proposal. 

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  

The evaluation factors are as follows:

	1.  Past Performance
	     a.  Reputation
	     b.  Experience
	2.  Resource Management
                 a. Resources
                 b. Staffing
	3.  Menu Cycle and Variety
	4.  Sanitation and Preventive Maintenance
	5.  Controls
	6.  Price and Portion Policies
	7.  Budget (Pro Forma) 

Proposals will be evaluated and scored on the above evaluation factors.  The factors Reputation and Experience each are one and one-half times as important to the Government in the evaluation as any other single category.  The other categories are not listed in relative order of importance.

The Government will make award to the responsible offeror who's offer conforms to the solicitation and receives the highest total point score.  The State Licensing Agency (SLA) will complete for this facility and will be selected if their proposal is in the competitive range.  In the event they are not in the competitive range and two or more offerors are tied for the highest total point score, lost will be drawn to determine which offeror will be awarded the contract.  

Solicitations are available upon request from cynthia.brown @gsa.gov.  Proposals will be due February 15, 2006, at 2:30 PM, local time, at the following location.  GSA, Bid Room 1065, 7th & D Street, SW, Washington, DC 20407. Only written request will be accepted. Notification of any change shall be made only on the FedBizOPPS.

In addition, the Clinical Trials Core participates in community education on HIV prevention, recruitment of healthy adults into clinical trials, study design and analysis, and maintenance of regulatory standards.  
 
The VRC wishes to obtain services provided in a Mobile Clinic to enhance the VRC?s ability to reach its intended audience of potential research study participants in the specific areas of recruitment, enrollment, advertising, provision of services, volunteer retainment, and follow up.   Therefore,  the NIAID Acquisitions and Operations Branch (AMOB) is seeking sources to furnish, outfit, maintain, house, and operate a vehicle for use by the VRC as a Mobile Clinic.

Interested parties must provide a capability statement which demonstrates that the contractor:  is able to provide an appropriate vehicle; has facilities necessary to house and maintain the vehicle; can provide for the consistent operation of the vehicle based on VRC requirements; and has experience performing requirements of similar nature.  An interested vendors list will be available for all parties responding to this Sources Sought Notice.  Vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to submit their contact information to the email address below, in advance of the deadline, in order to facilitate possible teaming/subcontracting arrangements with contractors who provide operational support.

The purpose of this amendment is to post a Question and an Answer 
about the above subject project.  QUESTION: CAN USTDA PROVIDE MORE SPECIFICS ON WHAT THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS DEFINITIONAL MISSION ARE SO WE CAN BE MORE RESPONSIVE IN DEVELOPING A PROPOSAL?  ANSWER: We have limited information from the Government of Albania, but their request specifically deals with developing new food processing plants.  They would like to develop new food processing plants to expand their agricultural exports to its neighbors and EU member countries.  They have some existing food processing plants and they produce frozen fruits and vegetables on a limited scale.  These facilities are privately owned, but the Government of Albania would like to devleop this market and develop a strategy for building new food processing plants for the various products mentioned above.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: DESIGN FOR A FISH BARRIER DEVICE. This is a request for source information with no monetary or projected date of use placed on the information. The Forest Service is looking for a design for a fish barrier device that prevents all fish life history stage from being injured or entrained as a result of diverting water.  The criterion for such a device is as follows:
(1) Inexpensive per unit (hundreds to low thousands of dollars).
(2) Able to function in small mountain streams with a variety of channel shapes from (v-shaped to u-shaped) and substrate compositions (silt/organic to boulder/bedrock).
(3) Able to function over a range of high and low channel flows.
(4) Able to function when both small and large portions of the total channel flow are being diverted (i.e. 0.25 cfs diverted out of a total of 20 cfs in the channel or 3.5 cfs diverted out of total 4 cfs in the channel).
(5) Able to be installed with little ground disturbance. 
(6) Able to regulate the amount of water being diverted through the device.
(7) Prevents small and large aquatic organisms (mainly fish) from being diverted down the diversion ditch.
(8) Is not made of toxic materials.
(9) Prevents small and large aquatic organisms (mainly fish) from being trapped on or in the diversion parts.
(10) If the device is a screen then it meets NOAA Fisheries screen criteria.
(11) Able to function year around in locations that have 100 Degree F summers and -20 Degrees F winters. Including deep snow.
(12) Doesn't require excess water to be diverted in order to make the barrier device to function.
(13) Able to work over a wide range of diversion amounts (0.25 cfs to 7-8 cfs).
(14) Can be transported to the site and assembled without the use of heavy equipment.
(15) Requires little maintenance.
NAICS Code: 541990. Size Standard: $6.5 Million.

<DESC>THERE ARE NO FUNDS AGAINST THIS BAA ANNOUNCEMENT. The US Army Contracting Agency, White Sands Directorate (WSMR DOC), White Sands Missile Range in support of Test Resource Management Center, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), is soliciting whi te papers and proposals, both technical and costs for innovative research and development concepts focused in the area of Unmanned and Autonomous System Testing (UAST).  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) identifies scientific and technical areas of inte rest for research and or exploratory development of 14 Topic Areas. The BAA is conducted using full and open competition. In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, the BAA utilizes a two- step process. The first step will be the submission of a w hite paper.  The white paper must contain as a minimum: Title, Period of Performance, Rough Order of Magnitude Cost, Company Address, Technical and Contracting Points of Contact, Phone, Fax & Email, Task Objective, Technical Summary and Proposed Deliverabl es.  Offerors that submit white papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the Government will be invited to submit a proposal (step two).  The submission of a white paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal .  Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award.  White papers submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA. Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scie ntific review process.  A white papers technical evaluation and its importance to agency programs, along with funding availability are primary bases for contract award. Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate.  W hite papers will be accepted continuously through 13 February 2007.   The BAA technical areas of interest are divided into the following groups: 1. Time, Space, Position Information (TSPI) Applications, 2. Real Time Measurements at System and Sub-System Le vels, 3. No a priori World Model (e.g. Battlespace) - development of maps/models required for a UAS to view its Battlespace, 4. Flexible, Timely, and Efficient Communications, 5. Power/Energy Management to Support UAST, 6. Sensing and Perception for UAST, 7. Command and Control (C2) Test Networks for Multiple UAS Platforms, 8. Multi-Sensor/Multi-Modal Data Fusion, 9. UAS Collaboration in System of Systems (SoS) / Family of Systems (FoS), 10. Emergent Behavior/Complex Systems - development of predictive tech niques of how UAS performance modifications may be produced by external stimuli, changes in the environment or other factors, 11. Network Centric/Information Networks, 12. Ensuring Safety in all Battlespaces, 13. Information/ Knowledge Processing and Manag ement and 14. Modeling Unstructured/Dynamic Environments.         OFFEROR INFORMATION: Evaluations may take up to 60 days from receipt of White Paper to complete.    Numerous awards may result from this BAA and will depend upon the quality and merit of whi te papers and proposals received and available funding. If the Government decides to pursue a concept with regard to this BAA a formal proposal will be requested.  Award of any contracts resulting from this BAA is anticipated to occur in FY07.    If select ed, you must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (http://www.ccr.gov/) in order to receive the award.  If you are not in the CCR at the time we are ready to make the award, you will be disqualified. Issuance of this BAA does not obli gate the Government to fund any white paper, pay any proposal preparation costs, or to award any contract.     All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a white paper, which will be considered.

<DESC>The Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC) authorizes, orders, stocks and consumes a large volume of hazardous materials (HazMat) in support of depot maintenance activities, depot commodity production, and other base or tenant requirements.  Due to the multitude of vendors, purchasing systems, storage methods, and delivery systems in which this material is currently obtained, excessive delays are frequently experienced in the supply chain and have a negative impact on mission support at OO-ALC. The purpose of this program is to have a single entity responsible for providing on-time logistics support for the purchase and delivery of authorized HazMat to the designated points of issue at Hill AFB, UT, while ensuring the Air Force remains compliant with all applicable federal, state, local, and HAFB environmental laws and regulations.

<DESC>The Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC) authorizes, orders, stocks and consumes a large volume of metals and plastics in support of depot maintenance activities, depot commodity production, and other base or tenant requirements.  Due to the multitude of vendors, purchasing systems, storage methods, and delivery systems in which this material is currently obtained, excessive delays are frequently experienced in the supply chain and have a negative impact on mission support at OO-ALC.  The purpose of this acquisition is to provide on-time delivery of metals and plastics to support mission requirements.

<DESC>Within the U.S. Census Bureau, the Database Management Systems Branch (DMSB) of the Systems Support Division (SSD) is responsible for providing technical support, including installation support, upgrades, database design, and performance tuning, etc., and troubleshooting for all issues that might be encountered by Oracle database administrators at the Census Bureau relating to Oracle software products.  DMSB provides assistance when all other avenues of help within the organization have been exhausted.  This level of assistance requires expert, in depth knowledge of Oracle software products sufficient to perform detailed analysis of how each product performs within the Census Bureau environment in regards to the intended application, and to develop solutions, including software patches, to problems. Oracle products are used for critical Census applications that support the Decennial Census, Economic Census, annual surveys, monthly surveys, and various periodic surveys. In addition, Oracle expertise is needed to support the Census Bureau?s effort to migrate to the Blade Architecture at the Bowie Computer Center by creating Oracle-certified builds.    

The U.S. Census Bureau is seeking sources for enterprise-wide advanced software support for its Oracle software products.  The specific Oracle products covered by this requirement include the following products: Oracle Server - Enterprise Edition; Oracle Advance Replication Option; Oracle JServer Enterprise Edition; Oracle Objects for OLE; Oracle Distributed Option; Oracle Parallel Query Option; Oracle Warehouse Builder; Oracle RMAN; Oracle Advanced Security; Oracle Spatial; Oracle Partitioning; Oracle Label Security; Oracle Real Application Cluster; Oracle ASM; SQL*Plus; Oracle Server - Personal Edition; Oracle Database Lite; Oracle Grid Control; Oracle Change Management Pack; Oracle Tuning Pack; Oracle Diagnostics Pack; Oracle Application Server Enterprise Edition (Forms Services, Report Services, TopLink and Application Development Framework, Portal, Discoverer Viewer, Discoverer Plus, Identity Management, Application InterConnect Toolkit, Wireless Option, and Personalization); Oracle Developer Suite (Forms Developer, Report Developer, Discoverer Administration Edition, Discoverer Desktop Edition, Designer, and Business Components for Java); Oracle General Ledger; Oracle Email Center; Oracle Treasury; Oracle Precompilers; Oracle TeleSales; Oracle iStore; Oracle Telephony; Manager; Oracle Scripting; Oracle Order Management; Oracle Sales Analyzer; Oracle Quality Online; Oracle Customers Online; Siebel Business Applications; and PeopleSoft Enterprise Human Capital Management. The Census Bureau has obtained this support in the past from Oracle USA, Inc. under its GSA Schedule 70 contract.

Interested parties should submit a detailed statement of their qualifications, not exceeding 25 pages, for providing the required support by e-mail to Maxine.R. Hodges at Maxine.R.Hodges@census.gov by 3:00pm, EST, Thursday, January 4, 2007. Interested parties must clearly demonstrate that they have (1) the requisite capabilities and resources to perform enterprise-wide advanced Oracle software support for each of the Oracle products referenced in the aforegoing paragraph, (2) the ability to escalate Service Requests (SRs) within Oracle Support, (3) direct access to Oracle product developers for the full suite of Oracle products, and (4) direct access to Oracle?s internal tracking systems, support systems, development groups, information repositories, and other resources critical to the performance and stability of Oracle systems.  The Government will consider each submission for purposes of determining whether this requirement is appropriate for set-aside to small businesses or for acquisition by means of competitive processes.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation and will not bind the contractor or the Government in any way or at any time into a contract with any of the specified terms below.     This is a Market Survey to identify potential sources to manufacture and deliver the Ne w Technology Vertical Displacement Gyroscopes (gyros) CN-811 and CN-1314. This effort is intended for an 8(a) set-aside. The configurations of the CN-811 and CN-1314 are identical except the installation requirements: the CN-811 is used in the Army CH-47D Chinook helicopter and the CN-1314 is used in the Army UH-60A/L Black Hawk helicopter.  The gyros that the Army currently uses employ Spinning Mass Technology.  The Army is interested in suppliers who can provide gyros utilizing New Technology [(e.g. Solid  State, Micro Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS)].  The intent is to procure a drop-in Form Fit and Function (F3) replacement gyroscope using new technology in place of the spinning mass technology gyroscope without any modification to the helicopters.  Perf ormance Specifications are available for the CN-811 and CN-1314 gyros and will be supplied to any potential manufacturers.  (See below for contact information for specifications or if additional information is required). Requirements for consideration for this contractual effort are as follows: 1) This requirement is intended as an 8(a) set-aside; 2) suppliers must obtain Interim Safety of Airworthiness Qualification (ISAQ) Certification approval by the AMCOM Aviation Engi neering Directorate (AED), AMSRD-AMR-AE, Bldg 4488 2nd Floor, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama 35898-5000; and 3) suppliers must certify that the supplier can ultimately receive AMCOM AED full Air Worthiness Release Certification approval and start delivery of th ese items around October 2007 .  Supplier capable of manufacturing and delivering these items must so indicate, by writing to Commander, US Army C-E LCMC, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-CCS-N-AC, Building 1200E, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5043. The response must include documentation such as Air Worthiness Release Certification (or schedule of this event) for the item(s). This Market Survey does not obligate the Government to award a contract nor does it guarantee any future contract. No telephone responses will be accepted, only responses in writing or email will be considered. For more information contact Daniel L Corwin,  Daniel.corwin@us.army.mil.  The deadline for response is 29 December 2006.

<DESC>XM982 EXCALIBUR Ia-2 TACOM-ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is seeking qualified sources for a 54 month production effort for the unitary warhead sub-assembly  of the XM982 â€œExcaliburâ€. Initial award is anticipated in August 2007,  initial year hardware deliveries are expected to start 18 months after award. The Excalibur Unitary Warhead is the lethal mechanism for the XM982 â€œExcaliburâ€  projectile.  It shall defeat critical targets while minimizing collateral  damage and unexploded ordnance.  The first unitary warhead, Block Ia-1, began  production in FY05 and is currently in production. The second unitary warhead,  Block Ia-2, is expected to be a lower cost alternative to the Block Ia-1  Warhead with equivalent performance. The Block Ia-2 warhead must be designed with Government purpose rights and will  be provided to prospective bidders in the upcoming Block 1b contract as  government furnished material. It is desired that the Warheads produced and delivered under the pending contract  require the minimum possible verification testing.  To this end the Government  is providing the Excalbur System Performance Specification (PRF12999870),  a Government developed Warhead interface drawing and the non-proprietary  drawings associated with the current Block 1a-1 warhead design. All responses to this market survey are required to be English. To be considered, all interested sources must provide requested information and  data in response to the following:  a. Provide evidence of interoperability of the proposed warhead design in  accordance with the provided interface documents and with XM982 Guidance  Section(see reference document 28280-3), Base (see reference document  N00321167) and Fuze Safe & Arm.  b. Provide evidence of meeting the Key Performance Parameters (Reliability,  Lethality and Insensitive Munition) when launched from US or Swedish howitzer  systems. c.  Provide evidence that the proposed warhead design will meet the Governments  desire for the minimum possible verification testing.  This evidence shall  include a list of proposed verification tests and a timeline for completion.   d.  For production deliveries, do you anticipate requiring any waivers or  deviations from the performance specification?  If so, provide a list.  e.  Describe the proposed production facility (location, minimum and maximum  capacity, available equipment, proposed additional equipment that is currently  not in place, existing production of this or similar warheads, etc.) and the   process that will be used to produce the proposed design. f. Provide rough order magnitude estimated price per projectile in U.S.  dollars for annual production quantities based on the assumption that this  is a four year multiple-year fixed price contract with quantity range 200  to 750 of annual production. The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards of the Block Ia-2  Unitary Warhead Production effort via Full and Open Competition.  This market survey is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute  a Request for Proposal (RFP). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the  U.S. Government. No award will be made as a result of this market survey. All  information is to be submitted at a no cost or obligation to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey. The Government is not  obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. Interested  sources should submit their qualification data and requested information within  45 days of this notice to Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce,  ATTN: Mr. Josh Minorics, AMSML-AQ-CA, Bldg. 9, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000.

<DESC>Background Statement and Purpose

The Iraqi Civil Aviation Authority has the responsibility to operate safely in accordance with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs).  To facilitate aircraft operations, trained, certified air traffic controllers have to direct aircraft entering, departing and moving through the Iraqi airports? airspace and its environs.  Currently, the Iraqi Civil Aviation Authority (ICAA) and the US Government, through a contract with DynCorp International, are training Iraqi personnel to handle the Air Traffic Control (ATC) functions. At this time, the Iraqi trainees have not acquired the required experience necessary to manage the air traffic control functions in all locations.  At the present time, the United States Air Force (USAF) provides air traffic services in most locations, with Iraqi trainees beginning to assume some functions.  

By April 2007, the ICAA controllers will initiate a three phased process to assume the primary air traffic control responsibilities in the high altitude enroute airspace, and later, assume primary control of other parts of the Iraqi air traffic control system. The current structure of the Iraqi Enroute airspace is broken up into three Areas:  Baghdad North (Kirkuk Sector), Baghdad, (Balad Sector) and Baghdad South (Ali Sector).  The ICAA controller?s will begin assuming control of Balad Sector, followed by Kirkuk Sector, and finally they will assume control of the southern part of the airspace- Ali Sector.  See the website http://ramcc.dtic.mil/iraq.htm, to include the link for the AERONAUTICAL INFORMATION PUBLICATION (AIP) for up to date information on the Iraqi Airspace.

The ICAA?s current ATC trainees are partway through their training to perform air traffic control functions in accordance with ICAO SARPs.  To complete training, the trainees require real-time experience and on-the-job-training (OJT). More beginning trainees will enter the training program to perform air traffic control functions in accordance with ICAO Standards in the expanding responsibilities of the ICAA. 

The purpose of this contract is to enter into an agreement with a contractor to provide training courses, and OJT leading to ICAA ATC personnel becoming compliant with ICAO SARPs, and provide ATC Services in accordance with ICAO SARPsat various ATC and Airport facilities throughout Iraq.

<SUBJECT>A--Announcement for Request for Submission of Proposals for Applied Science Projects.
<DESC>The United States Department of the Interior Office of Surface Mining (OSM) is requesting proposals for projects that develop and demonstrate improved technologies to address environmental issues related to the mining of coal and reclamation of the land after mining.  Project funding will be limited to projects that can be completed without additional funding from OSM beyond those funds awarded in fiscal year 2007.  OSM will consider all proposals relating to surface coal mining and reclamation.  However, the National Technology Transfer Team (NTTT) has identified topical areas where special emphasis is needed.  Proposals related to the following topics will improve their ranking score:  Blasting Issues; Hydrology Issues, Steep Slope Mining and Reclamation; Underground Mine Mapping;  Use of Recycled Materials; Landscape Stability;  Soil Development on Reclaimed Lands; Vegetation Assessment, Wildlife Conservation, and Reforestation; Cropland Reclamation.  The proposal application must be received by March 2, 2007. Each proposal should be submitted hard copy and as an electronic copy in PDF format or on a CD in PDF format.  Send proposal applications to the following address:  Kimery Vories, Team Leader NTTT, Office of Surface Mining, 501 Belle Street, Room 216, Alton, Illinois 62002, Tel. #618-463-6463 Ext. 103, e-mail kvories@osmre.gov.  All proposals must support activities in one of OSM's three regions although it may apply to more than one region or nationally.  Each proposal must support activities in the region within which the applicant's project is located and may include salaries, travel, equipment, materials, and services not including fees or profit.  All proposals must include a letter of endorsement, (on official letterhead) by an appropriately authorized management official representing either a State, Indian, or Federal Title IV Abandoned Mine Land or Title V Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) Regulatory Authority.  Proposals without such an endorsement will not be considered for funding.  Neverless, OSM reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any and all proposals.  In summary, in order for a proposal to be considered, it must include the following:  Electronic and paper submission must be received on or before the due date.  The proposal must follow the application instructions, including completed forms FP-1 and B-1.  Applicants may request funding, not to exceed $100,000 for the current FY 2007.  The vehicle for awarding funds will be a cooperative agreement.  OSM recommends a minimum cost-share of 25 percent with the applicant providing some portion of this percentage.  The remainder may come from academia, industry, or other non-federal sources.  OSM also recommends, as part of the full proposal application, signed letters of support indicating specific cash and/or in-kind services meeting the minimum 25 percent cost-share.  (For a definition of cost-sharing see Federal Register 59 (64) Monday, April 4, 1994, Section 19.23.)  OSM will announce the total amount of available funding at a later date and will grant the awards.  It is expected that funds will be available after July 1, 2007.  However, there is no guarantee that any funds will be available.  OSM will notify applicants as to whether or not their proposal has been accepted. The full announcement is available electronically on line at www.mcrcc.osmre.gov. In order to receive a paper copy, please contact Kimery C. Vories e-mail address kvories@osmre.gov.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Navy and Marine Corps Aviation Training Systems Spare and Repair Parts
<DESC>The NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division is responsible for acquisition, fielding and life cycle support of Navy and Marine Corps Aviation training systems suitable for effective training.  Life cycle support includes ensuring the availability of an initial material support package at time of device fielding and the acquisition of spare and repair parts attributable to device modifications and upgrades.  These Navy and Marine Corps Aviation Training System?s Spare and Repair Parts are the focus of this notice prior to the issuance of the Class J&A N61339-07-131C.  NAVAIR Orlando TSD intends on negotiating and awarding multiple spare and repair buys on a sole source basis from 1 January 2007 through 31 December 2007.  The total estimated amount of these purchases is expected to approach $10 million.  The Navy and Marine Corps Aviation training system Original Equipment Manufacturer platforms and major subsystems to which this synopsis applies are annotated in Attachment (A).  Furthermore, the sole source original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of spare and repair parts within these subsystems are enumerated within Attachment (A).  Attachment (A) may be found at the NAVAIR Orlando Business Opportunities website at http://ntsc.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Index.cfm.  Once linked to the website, select ENTRY TYPES to ALL.  The attachment will be located under the heading Navy and Marine Corps Aviation Training Systems Spare and Repair Parts.  While this synopsis serves as a pre-solicitation notice of the sole source acquisitions for spare and repair parts from the OEMs listed in Attachment (A), it is not intended to preclude the Government from acquiring spare and repair parts through the training system design/build contractor as this strategy may serve the Government?s best interest.  The proposed contract actions are for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only the Attachment (A) sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties not identified within Attachment (A) are encouraged to express their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  Responses to this Sources Sought notice shall be received NLT  fifteen days from the posting date.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether respondents should be added to Attachment (A).  In those situations where the Government determines that identical parts are available from more than one source, it will compete these acquisitions among the identified sources.  A determination by the Government not to compete these proposed contract actions based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  See Number Notes 2 and 22.

1. BACKGROUND - The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerates the prototyping and deployment of technologies that reduce homeland vulnerabilities.  S&T performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, and universities.  With terrorist events such as the Madrid rail bombing, the London Underground attack, and the recent exposure of possible attacks on U.S. bound flights from the United Kingdom, there is an urgent operational need for a unified approach to the detection of liquid explosives in the civil aviation industry as well as other mass transit modes of transportation.  This project is in support of the ongoing effort by S&T to counter the recent increase from liquid explosives threat.  S&T's goal is to investigate any and all potential detection technologies capable of detecting and distinguishing explosives and flammable liquids from benign liquids (drinks, lotions, hygiene products, contact lens solutions, etc.).  Homemade Explosives (HME) such as black powder, triacetonetriperoxide (TATP), hexamethylene-triperoxidediamine (HMTD), chlorates, and perchlorates mixed with sugar or other fuels have come to be used instead of commercial explosives.  In support of this critical focus area, S&T is initiating the Home Made Explosives (HME) Detection System Development Program. Its goals are: To immediately evaluate Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems capable of detecting Home Made Explosives (HME); To develop, rapidly prototype, and improve products and systems capable of detecting HMEs; To support the research and development of next generation, novel technologies, algorithms or prototypes for the detection of HMEs; To address potential operational venues, including airport and mass transit checkpoints for passengers and carryon baggage (not cargo or checked baggage).  This BAA consists of four Technical Topic Areas (TTAs) with multi-phased program approaches described in Section 2.4.  The BAA is structured to solicit Proposals for the immediate evaluation of projects (TTA-1) where COTS are to be evaluated within 3 to 6 months after award.  Proposals are also to be solicited to develop and improve products in the Prototype or Breadboard stage (TTA-2).  It is anticipated that prototypes will be ready for developmental testing under TTA-2 no later than 30 months after award.  In addition, proposals will be solicited to support the research and development of the next generation or novel technologies in an immature stage of development (TTA-3).  It is anticipated that these technologies will be ready for prototype developmental testing no later than 48 months after award.  The final Proposal solicitation will be for innovative algorithms and data analysis tools to support current COTS and prototypes under development (TTA-4).  It is anticipated that algorithms and data analysis tools will be ready for hosting and testing on selected HME platforms within 24 months after award.
1.1  Program Description - The Home Made Explosives Detection Program will require current technology, and/or innovative or novel capabilities in multiple disciplines including material science, computer science, chemistry, physics, electrical, mechanical and systems engineering.  In order to best accomplish these goals, S&T anticipates receiving proposals with innovative teaming that may include private sector organizations, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and academic institutions.  DOE National Laboratories are precluded from participating in this BAA and any potential R&D efforts by the National labs will be funded separately by S&T.  TTA-4 is intended to encourage small companies and academic institutions with innovative ideas for advanced algorithms and data analysis tools that could be hosted on COTS or near COTS systems.  Coordination and potential teaming is encouraged between algorithm developers and hardware or system developers in Phase II of the TTA-4 projects to demonstrate the proposed capability.
2. PROGRAM APPROACH AND SCHEDULE - The approach and schedule ensures that HME detection technologies will be in place in a timely manner to be effective against indiscriminate threats and new innovative technologies will be researched to further the Nation?s safety.  S&T anticipates making multiple awards under this solicitation.  Small companies and academic institutions with innovative detection technologies or advanced analysis algorithms are encouraged to propose efforts under the most appropriate TTA.  Coordination and potential teaming between hardware or system developers and algorithm developers is encouraged in the Phase II efforts.  2.1 Government Furnished Equipment and Resources - In support of the TTAs, the Government will consider requests for Government furnished resources and technologies.  As part of this solicitation S&T will not publish a list of potentially applicable technologies for accelerated schedule Proposals.  2.2 Review Panel - A review panel drawn from Government and non-Government experts who have signed appropriate non-disclosure agreements will perform technical evaluations or assessments of the proposed efforts.  2.3 Test and Evaluation Facilities - Department of Homeland Security Science & Technology Directorate will make available appropriate test and evaluation facilities to support this program.  Bidders must note any specific requirements required for test and evaluation (T&E) of proposed concepts in their proposal.  Due to the nature of the material being tested and safety concerns, T&E activities will be conducted by trained personnel per S&T' direction.  It will be the responsibility of the selected performers to setup, maintain, and train S&T directed test personnel on the selected systems.  2.4 Program Structure and Program Schedule - The BAA consists of four Technical Topic Areas (TTAs), described below. Responses to TTA-1 should propose immediate (3-6 month) solutions, TTA-2 should provide near term (6-30 month) solutions, TTA-3 should provide long term (30-48 month) developmental solutions, whereas those to TTA-4 should describe algorithm and data analysis technology for the immediate and near term solutions for testing within 24 months.  All responses to TTA-2, TTA-3, and TTA-4 should describe multi-phased efforts, offering clear points for decisions about whether proceeding to the next phase is technically justified.  Performance enhancements that should be strongly considered include increased probability of detection, reduced false alarm rate or automated determinations to aid screener decision making.  Continuation of work past Phase I will also be based upon the availability of funds, potential teaming arrangements and other programmatic considerations as determined by S&T.  
TTA-1: Provide immediately available Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems capable of detecting Home Made Explosives (HME) suitable for checkpoint use in Airports and other Mass Transit facilities.  These systems must be ready for immediate test and evaluation at various facilities, as specified by DHS S&T.  
TTA-2: Provide COTS or Prototype technologies and/or systems that with minor hardware improvements or innovative algorithms and data analysis tools that will significantly improve performance and total cost of ownership of COTS detection systems for HME materials and containers at the checkpoint for passengers and carryon baggage.  The Government anticipates that these efforts will be structured in two phases and will result in fabrication of a prototype system meeting or exceeding most of the goals and Concept-of-Operations (CONOPS) coordinated with TSA prior to completion of Phase I:  Phase I Primary Deliverables:  Successful Critical Design Review (CDR) and performance predictions with supporting data for the prototype system.  Phase II Primary Deliverables: Prototype system ready for T&E in 6-30 months after award of Phase I, Test plan for developmental T&E approved by the Government.  TTA-3: Develop novel or innovative technologies and/or systems to provide significant improvements in the performance and total cost of ownership compared to current technologies or those being developed in projects addressing TTA-1 and TTA-2 requirements.  The Government anticipates that these efforts will be structured in two phases and will result in fabrication of a prototype, system meeting or exceeding most of the goals for the selected applications.  CONOPS must be coordinated with TSA prior to completion of Phase I:  Phase I Primary Deliverables: Successful CDR and performance predictions with supporting data for the prototype system. Phase II Primary Deliverables: Prototype system ready for T&E in 30-48 months after award of Phase I, test plan for developmental T&E approved by the Government.  TTA-4: Provide immediate, developmental or innovative algorithms and data analysis tools that will significantly improve performance and total cost of ownership of COTS detection systems for HME materials and containers at the checkpoint for passengers and carryon baggage.  It is anticipated that these efforts will be structured in two phases and will culminate in a software package ready for developmental testing in selected HME detection platforms proposed by the vendor:  Phase I Primary Deliverables: Feasibility analysis, performance predictions with supporting data for the modified systems.  Completed teaming arrangements with hardware or system developers.  Phase II Primary Deliverables: Software package ready for T&E in 24 months after award of Phase I, Test plan for developmental T&E approved by the Government.  Figure 1. A notional schedule of the program execution timeline.  Offerors are encouraged to propose their own schedule based upon their detailed understanding of the technical challenges and their realistic estimate of the technical effort required to solve the problem they propose.  Projects addressing each of the TTAs must include: contractor performed lab tests, developmental test and evaluation tasks, and, where appropriate, operational user-oriented field tests.  3. OBJECTIVES AND GOALS, 3.1 Preliminary Requirements - There are a number of operational requirements that need to be addressed when evaluating technologies for potential deployment. Below is a list of preliminary requirements that will be refined or clarified by TSA with respect to their future operations.  It is assumed that unopened containers for primary screening will be the standard, and that opening containers may be a potential approach for secondary screening to clear alarms from primary screening.  A threat/no threat response will be satisfactory for primary screening (no threat meaning that this item contains a substance that is recognized to be a typical stream of commerce substance, and a threat designation represents something outside that definition).  It is recognized that some techniques provide higher quality chemical identification than others (with concurrent disadvantages in other areas).  A probability of detection (Pd) objective will be >0.90 and a false alarm rate (FAR) <0.05.  However, much higher Pds and much lower FARs are desired and preference will be given to proposals that realistically project these improved rates.  The throughput objective is no fewer than five people per minute or 10 packages/items per minute.  Total time includes entry and exit of portal or checkpoint, analysis, and results.  Consumables (e.g., filters, reactive agents, batteries) required for operation and routine maintenance of the production system (if any) should be minimal, and should not exceed 5% of the unit cost per year of routine operations.  The production system should not require extensive factory level maintenance.  If factory level maintenance is required, it must not normally be required at a greater frequency than one time every three years, and should not cost over 10% of the total unit cost.  The system must be designed so it is sufficiently easy to operate such that security personnel following initial training (not to exceed 12 hours) can safely and effectively operate the system.  Safety standards:  Must meet appropriate safety standards for safe operation, Must meet Hazards and Electronic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) safety standards, Must be intrinsically safe per Underwriters Laboratory (UL) 913, Any field calibration, if required, must be accomplished within the setup time (or separately during routine maintenance) without any specialized instrumentation, Powered using standard U.S. power requirements (Selectable 115 VAC 60 Hz or 220 VAC 60 Hz), or where appropriate, batteries (e.g., off the shelf 9V, C, or AA and/or rechargeable versions), All proposed concepts and designs must be appropriate for indoor and/or outdoor applications, must be benign to humans and property in the interrogated area, and eventually must be cost-effective to procure and maintain.  Depending on the concept design and application, the devices should have the potential to be portable, transportable, or moveable between inspection sites.  Deliverables, depending on the TTA level shall include a COTS or prototype device and an operator?s manual, suitable for dissemination to law enforcement or security professionals, which includes maintenance procedures and a recommended operational employment protocol.
3.2 Technical Topic Areas - The objectives and goals of each TTA emphasize specific phases of readiness of technologies, systems and algorithms in the detection of HMEs.  The TTA topics are detailed below:  TTA-1: Immediate Need - Provide immediately available Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems capable of detecting Home Made Explosives (HME) suitable for checkpoint use in Airports and other Mass Transit facilities.  These systems must be ready for immediate test and evaluation at various facilities, as specified by DHS S&T.  TTA-2: Near Term Need - Provide COTS or Prototype technologies and/or systems that with minor hardware improvements or innovative algorithms and data analysis tools that will significantly improve performance and total cost of ownership of COTS detection systems for HME materials and containers at the checkpoint for passengers and carryon baggage.  We anticipate that these efforts will be structured in two phases and will result in fabrication of a prototype system meeting or exceeding most of the goals and CONOPS coordinated with TSA prior to completion of Phase I.
TTA-3: Long Term Need - Develop novel or innovative technologies and/or systems to provide significant improvements in the performance and total cost of ownership compared to current technologies or those being developed in projects addressing TTA-1 and TTA-2 requirements.  We anticipate that these efforts will be structured in two phases and will result in fabrication of a prototype system meeting or exceeding most of the goals for the selected applications.  CONOPS must be coordinated with TSA prior to completion of Phase I.  TTA-4: Algorithm Need - Provide immediate, developmental or innovative algorithms and data analysis tools that will significantly improve performance and total cost of ownership of COTS detection systems (including currently deployed systems) for HME materials and containers at the checkpoint for passengers and carryon baggage.  It is anticipated that these efforts will be structured in two phases and will culminate in a software package ready for developmental testing in selected HME detection platforms proposed by the vendor.

NexTalk for Networks is client communications software for use with NXi Text Services (NTS). NexTalk for Networks is designed for person-to-person "text telephone" use, providing compatibility with the TTYs used by the deaf and hard of hearing. NexTalk for Networks allows for direct calls to and from any TTY or modem by using shared network modems that are TTY-compatible. With NexTalk for Networks, you can also carry on text conversations and exchange messages with other NexTalk users on a LAN or WAN (without the use of a TTY modem or TTY device).

Within the Department of Education, individuals use NexTalk TTY Services with reasonable accommodations needs covered by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. These individuals are either deaf, hard of hearing or have a speech disability or frequently communicate with others that would fall in that scope.

Call Centers at the Department of Education also use NexTalk TTY Services for external and internal TTY communications with public constituents and Federal Employees that are either deaf, hard of hearing or have a speech disability. Section 255 under the Federal Communications Act covers this under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

NexTalk TTY Services have also been used for emergency communications within the Department when the telephone and email services have been down.  If the maintenance were not purchased, the Department would not be abiding by the Act's Sections 504, 508, and 255.  Also, the individuals with reasonable accommodations will not be able to do their jobs.

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS

A. Systems Submission of Invoices. 

 Invoice submission is a two step process:

The Vendor shall develop an Acceptance Information document in IT Solutions Shop (ITSS) and attach a copy of invoice with all required back-up documentation.

     Current ITSS web site https://it-solutions.gsa.gov

The Vendor shall also complete the invoice form on the Finance web site and attach soft copy of invoice.  This is the official system of record; the invoice will not be processed for payment unless this process is completed.  

     Current General Services Administration (GSA) Finance web site is www.finance.gsa.gov.  Go to
    http://finance.gsa.gov/password/ to obtain Password/Sign-Up for Email Notification.

B. Invoice Submission Process.

?	Submit each invoice only once.  Submitting multiple copies confuses and delays processing.

?	If editing is required, update the first submission; don?t create a second invoice submission.

?	Make sure the invoice amount and the acceptance document amount are the same.

?	Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Don?t use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

?	Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

?	If an invoice is rejected, a corrected invoice will be submitted using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. ?R? to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

?	In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice. This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

?	Invoice must be submitted in ITSS on Acceptance Information document and include copy of invoice and required back-up attached.

C. Timing of invoices.

Invoices shall be submitted for payment of deliverables that have been completed and accepted by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).

For Firm Fixed Price (FFP), this will be a completed and accepted deliverable.  Evidence that the COR accepted the deliverable must be present before the GSA Project Manager (PM) can proceed.  Ensure the invoice is submitted in accordance with the established payment schedule.  

For Time and Material (T&M), this will be a month?s worth of services.  The COR will certify that the contractor has performed in accordance with the statement of work and the government has received the hours and/or materials billed by the contractor.  Ensure the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, are fully complied with.  GSA PM will certify the invoice for payment.

D. Payment of Invoices.

Payment of invoices shall be based on the quality of the invoiced deliverable.  If the invoiced deliverable does not meet the established contractual standards, the invoice will not be paid until the deliverable has been determined to meet the established standards, as applicable.

	The contractor is reminded that invoices will be submitted In accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions ? Commercial Items, paragraph g, which states the following:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     This is solicitation number HQ0423-07-T-0002 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).     The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular, Fac 2005-14, Effective 22 Nov 2006 & Class Deviation 2005-o0001.     This requirement is UNRESTRICTED.     Requirement:  Supply the following in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW): Line 0001- Web-Based Mentoring System - Date of Award through 30 Sep 07;  Line 0002-	8-Hour Training Session - 1 EA; Line 0003- Web-Based Mentoring System - Option Year One; Line 0004- Web-Based Mentoring System - Option Year Two; Line 0005-	Web-Based Mentoring System - Option Year Three; Line 0006- Web-Based Mentoring System - Option Year Four     Description of items/services:     STATEMENT OF WORK, DFAS MENTORING & COACHING PROGRAM, WEB-BASED MENTORING SYSTEM     1.	BACKGROUND:  The DFAS Corporate Mentoring and Coaching program was established in 2002 to help foster a highly professional workforce with indispensable skills and competencies.  Three critical elements make up the program:  Corporate and Site Mentoring Program Managers, Mentoring and Coaching Training, and a Mentoring System that allows participants to register and search for a mentoring or coaching partner.  The current system provides a place for DFAS employees to register, but lacks adequate search capability, the ability to keep track of the mentoring relationships,  and capability to provide real time reports.     2.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<SUBJECT>C -- A-E Services for Programming & Design of Integrated Facility Improvements at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center
<SOLNBR>LGL06R00012
<RESPDATE>092006
<CONTACT>Robert Driggers, Contracting Officer, Phone 912-261-3630, Fax 912-280-5343, Email bob.driggers@dhs.gov - Paulette Webster, Procurement Technician, Phone 912-554-4613, Fax 912-280-5343, Email paulette.webster@dhs.gov
<DESC>Architect-Engineering Services (A&E Services) are required for pre-planning services and the resultant design of facility improvements and enhancements at Plum Island, NY, Animal Disease Center (PIADC).  It is the intention of the Government to award the pre-planning and the design services to the same A&E firm.  The contract will contain options for additional services to include Construction Administration and Commissioning Services.  It is anticipated that a construction contract will be awarded soon after design begins.

Plum Island is a federally owned 840-acre island off the northeastern tip of Long Island, New York.  The island is approximately 1.5 miles from Orient Point, New York, and approximately 12 miles from New London, Connecticut, accessible only by limited ferry service for research facility employees and approved visitors.  PIADC is a unique critical national asset for Agro-defense and the only facility in the United States permitted to handle Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) live virus.  The facility is approximately 50 years old and is clearly beyond its design life.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Science and Technology (S&T) Directorate, Office of National Laboratories (ONL) was charged with assessing the facility and the identification of necessary facility upgrades to extend its lifetime over the next ten years to support the foreseeable combined DHS/USDA mission.

The proposed improvements and enhancements at PIADC facility will address necessary corrective actions to the facility, assure the continuation of existing research, and satisfy increased mission responsibilities for Agro-defense of DHS and USDA. 

The overall A&E services required shall include a combination of new construction, renovation of existing facilities, and the design, staging, commissioning and overall integration of all facilities within the unique constraints of performing work at PIADC.  As an island and a secure DHS property, it is critical that the selected A&E Services firm be able to adequately address the development of design documents and estimates that are cognizant of challenging logistics and coordination with ongoing operations.  Each of the improvements and enhancements identified below will require various levels of integration with actively utilized existing animal holding facilities and research laboratories, as well as with current facility operation control systems.  The A&E Services firm will be required to design these facilities and renovations in conformance with all applicable federal, state and local regulations, guidelines and codes and obtain all necessary permits or revisions to existing permits upon commissioning of all facilities.  In addition, the latest available best practices and design standards for USDA (USDA ARS Facilities Design Standards 242.1M-ARS available on the USDA web site) and AALAC shall be utilized.  The specific improvements and enhancements to be incorporated in the design may include:

•	Construct New Animal Wing, consisting of 8,000 net square feet of new BSL-3Ag animal holding capacity with various room sizes and configurations meeting AALAC standards.  A batch wastewater sterilization treatment system to handle bio-containment liquid effluent isolated to the new wing would also be required.
•	Upgrade Chiller Plant – Provide additional chiller with sufficient capacity to service all new construction and interior facility upgrades; replace and upgrade the chilled water transmission line leading to Building 101.
•	Expand and Upgrade the East and Orient Wing Necropsy Rooms– Construct new necropsy capability dedicated to research functions servicing the new animal holding wing.  The existing necropsy will be improved and expanded to handle state-of-the-art distance learning equipment, hands-on facilities for veterinary training and sufficient decontamination facilities to support training classes.  Retrofit incinerator intake areas will also be required to accommodate necropsy expansion.  Project staging and coordination will be required to maintain necropsy and crematory capabilities through all aspects of construction.
•	Convert the East Service Wing Storage Area to BSL-3+ Laboratory Space – Convert 2500 sq. ft. of existing storage space within BSL containment area to laboratory space for DHS research programs.  Project staging and coordination will be required to maintain building services access and to facilitate portions of this design area to be temporarily taken out of containment for construction activities.
•	Power Distribution/UPS—For the main laboratory (Bldg 101), develop a critical and non-critical electrical load distribution plan and implement by redistributing power and replacing old and/or obsolete equipment; provide reliable power to the critical loads via a battery back up Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) System using 480 volt static switching technology.  Aspects of this project will be performed within BSL-3+ containment facilities and other aspects will include the new construction laboratory projects as defined herein.
•	Bldg. 102 Waste Water Decontamination Upgrades—Provide necessary process upgrades (isolated tank, pump, piping replacements) to the laboratory wastewater decontamination system.  Provide a new wastewater transmission line from Building 101 to Building 102.  Perform necessary structural repairs, roofing and finishes to ensure the facility meets necessary bio-containment standards.
•	Upgrade Water Supply System—Provide evaluation of known issues, replacement of antiquated distribution system piping and upgrade of treatment systems related to the domestic water supply system, water purification system and fire suppression system.
•	Perform an Environmental Assessment – A new Environmental Assessment will be developed prior to the construction and improvements at PIADC to comply with NEPA requirements and DHS policy.  The Environmental Assessment shall incorporate potential impacts from all projects listed herein.
•	Firehouse/Motor Pool – Construct new firehouse/motor pool building to replace the antiquated and inadequate structures and to consolidate within the active area of the island the Firehouse, Motor Pool, and Emergency Operations Center (EOC).  

This acquisition is a total Small Business Set-Aside under NAICS Code 54310, with a Size Standard of $4.5 million.  This is a Request for Qualifications of Small Business A&E firms interested in contracting for this work.  A&E firm, as used in this synopsis, is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project pre-design services and design documents.  The scope of the A&E services required under this proposed contract includes, but is not limited to, the following:  Perform pre-design services, including the preparation of a planning document/feasibility study to include the basic requirements and information needed to procure, plan, design and perform the construction required for the Integrated Facility Improvements at PIADC; Prepare design documents for the facility through concepts, design development and construction documentation.  The Estimated Cost of Construction (ECC) will be between $22 and $30 million.

The purpose of this procurement is to select a highly qualified A&E Services firm with demonstrated expertise in the design of Bio-Safety Level 3, 3 Enhanced, and 3 Ag laboratories, large ungulate animal vivariums, necropsies, or similar facilities.   This contract will be procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6.  The A&E Services firm will be selected in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in this synopsis, the evaluation criteria in FAR Section 36.602-1, through review of Standard Form (SF) 330’s and subsequent interviews.  The top ranked A&E Services firm will be sent a Request for Proposal based on demonstrated competence and the unique qualifications for the required work.  After receipt of the firm’s proposal, negotiations will proceed.  A single firm-fixed price contract will be negotiated with separate line items for the Pre-design and Design Services.  The Government intends to utilize a Construction Manager at Risk or Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Contract procedure for this requirement.   Two contracts will ultimately be awarded: one to the A&E Services firm selected as a result of this notice; the other to a construction firm.  Under this concept, the CMc functions as a collaborative member of the project team.  The CMc will be responsible for all construction under a single contract and also provides expertise during the design process for the Government by checking estimates and performing constructability reviews.  It is anticipated that award of the CMc contract will follow closely behind the award of the A&E Services design contract so that the CMc can provide preconstruction services during the design phase.  At a pre-determined point in the design phase (likely at 70% design), the CMc offers a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) and construction of the project will begin, before design completion.  Complete design of this project is expected to take approximately 8 months; however, construction on the Motor Pool/Firehouse, which has already been designed, could begin much earlier.  During construction, the A&E Services firm will perform construction administration services and work closely with the Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc). Actual construction is estimated to commence 4-6 months after design begins and be completed within approximately 2 years.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

On January 9, 2005, the Government of Sudan (GOS) and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) officially ending Africa's longest running civil war.  Over the course of the 21-year conflict, fighting, famine, and disease killed more than 2 million people, forced an estimated 628,000 people to seek refuge in neighboring countries, and displaced more than 4 million people within Sudan'the largest internally displaced person (IDP) population in the world.  In April 2003, a separate conflict began in Darfur, Western Sudan when the locally based Sudanese Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) attacked GOS security forces in the city of El Fasher.  The resulting humanitarian emergency in Darfur affects an estimated 2.6 million people, approximately 40 percent of the population, including 1.9 million IDPs and 220,000 refugees in eastern Chad.  The concurrent emergencies have exacerbated already fragile humanitarian conditions, and challenged local capacity to provide for the population.

INTRODUCTION

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

A USAID Mission is now established in Khartoum, under which DCHA staff in Sudan work.  All DCHA staff, including OFDA, the Office of Food for Peace (FFP) and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), fall under the overall management of the DCHA Senior Humanitarian Advisor (SHA) based in Khartoum.  Other USAID Mission staff will be located in Khartoum and the southern capital, Juba.  The SHA oversees all DCHA assistance to Sudan, including the northern, southern, eastern and western regions of the country.  The DCHA staff are divided into two operational teams, one covering Darfur and one covering Southern Sudan.  The DCHA Team Leader for Darfur is responsible for DCHA programs, staff and activities in the Darfur Field Office.  The DCHA Team Leader for the South, who is co-located with the Sudan Field Office (SFO) for the South and is alternately based in Juba and Nairobi until the transition of the SFO from Nairobi to Juba is complete, is responsible for DCHA programs, staff and activities in the South.  There is close daily coordination between the DCHA units in Nairobi/Juba and Khartoum, and with the development programs managed by the rest of the USAID mission (both in Khartoum and Nairobi/Juba).

The Program Officer will work and live in Khartoum, reporting to the SHA and to the OFDA Sudan team in Washington D.C.  S/he will coordinate closely with the DCHA Team Leader for Southern Sudan as well, especially on issues regarding the Three Areas (Nuba, Abyei, and Southern Blue Nile States).  The Program Officer will exchange information regularly with colleagues covering Southern Sudan and Darfur portfolios, as well as with the Sudan program team in Washington D.C.  This includes sharing project ideas, strategies, and soliciting advice and guidance.  S/he will supervise a small team of experienced national staff specializing in the areas of food security, health, gender, and livelihoods.  Each national staff member also is responsible for a specific geographic area and specific grants.  The Program Officer will ensure a smooth allocation of the work load between all national staff so that maximum efficiency is achieved.  

The position will be contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

OBJECTIVE

OFDA must recruit a Program Officer for Northern Sudan in order to meet its program objectives.  The incumbent will serve as a primary point of contact for OFDA in the field and is responsible for developing strategies and plans, reviewing proposals, monitoring grants, liaising with grantees and other members of the humanitarian community, and reporting on the humanitarian situation.


9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The OFDA Program Officer will primarily provide full time in-country coordination and management of the humanitarian emergency in areas defined as under the authority of the Government of National Unity in Northern Sudan (including eastern Sudan) and the Three Areas.  The Program Officer may assist in humanitarian assistance activities in all parts of Sudan as needed.

This position requires substantial daily coordination with several OFDA staff members, as well as representatives from other USAID offices and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style.  The Program Officer must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly abide to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.  The incumbent may be required to serve as a critical component of a U.S. government disaster assessment team, DART, RMT, or to backfill other staff members in the overseas office.

The Program Officer's responsibilities will include, but not be limited to, the following:

* Serves as one of the principle contact points for OFDA in Sudan for humanitarian issues related to northern and eastern Sudan as well as the Three Areas.  Coordinates closely with the DCHA Darfur and Southern Sudan Teams, supervises relevant OFDA national program staff, and maintains regular contact with development assistance colleagues in the USAID mission (especially on issues regarding the Three Areas) as well as OFDA Sudan team members in Washington, D.C.

* Assesses a broad spectrum of emergency conditions to provide recommendations, implementation strategy, management oversight and evaluation of OFDA response programs.

* Maintains regular contact with OFDA grantees, as well as other United Nations (UN) agencies, International Organizations (IOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).  Meets regularly with U.S. government personnel, donors, Sudanese authorities, and others on humanitarian issues.  Represents OFDA at humanitarian coordination meetings.

* Works in close consultation with the SHA and the Team Leaders for Southern Sudan and Darfur to ensure that national staff competencies are used in the most efficient way to enhance the overall US Government response in the Three Areas, northern and eastern Sudan.

* Travels frequently (security permitting) to assess, evaluate and monitor conditions at OFDA project sites in Sudan, and make strategic recommendations for interventions.  Reports to OFDA on the quality of the grantee's work, noting deficiencies, attributes and evolving operational conditions, in close coordination with the SHA.

* Participates in and reports on joint donor humanitarian evaluations and UN led assessments, and participates actively in the international community response structures.

* Provides regular reporting, through official cables and other means, on issues related to the humanitarian situation in Sudan.  Provides overviews of patterns and trends in the humanitarian situation and keeps the SHA and the DCHA Team Leaders current on response issues.  Provides regular reports on site visits, meetings, general atmospherics and other issues that impact humanitarian relief efforts.

* Participates in development and implementation of OFDA and USAID strategy and plans for Sudan.

* Works with NGOs, IOs, and UN agencies that are developing proposals for OFDA (including grant amendments and extensions) in close coordination with the SHA, DCHA Team Leaders and the Sudan team in Washington D.C.  Ensures draft proposals' compliance with "OFDA's Guidelines for Grant Proposals and Reporting." Reviews concept papers and proposals; and provides recommendations/comments to OFDA for final funding determination.

* Coordinates, along with other Program Officers, Team Leaders and the SHA, with the donor community on policy issues affecting humanitarian operations, and to develop integrated, non-duplicative programs.  Prepares agendas and briefings for official U.S. government visitors interested in humanitarian issues.

<DESC>The purpose of amendment # 01 to RFQ # 263-07-008 is to Include the attached questions and answers.

Q 1: Is there an incumbent contract?
A 1: No  
 
Q 2What kind of contract do you anticipate awarding? 
A 2: It will be Commercial Items Order. 
 
Q 3 Can you please provide the name and contact information for the technical representative? 
A 3 At this time all communications should be with the Procurement Office.  Contact names and addresses in the synopsis.
 
Q 4 Can you please provide the program office? 
A 4 Question is not clear and does not affect the proposal submittal
 
Q 5 Is the place of performance the contractors facility? 
A 5 Yes 
	
Q 6 How many employees will be on payroll each year? 
A 6 Up to 150 

Q 7 Are all of these employees in the military? If not, how many are civilian? 
A 7 All are civilian

Q 8 How many employees will be in a combat zone, and how long will they be in a combat zone?  
A 8 None

Q 9 Is the pay for these payroll services $50,000--$100,000 for five years? If not, then what is the pay for each year? 
A 9 Each company will submit their costs to USAID.  USAID does not determine the price for services charged 
 
Q 10 When is the very last day to e-mail this proposal? 
A 10 The solicitation closes on December 16, 2006 at 17:30 hours, Cairo Local Time 

Q 11 Will these supervisors have their own computers? 
A 11 Yes.
 
Q 12 If so, what types of computers will they have?  
A 12 USAID will not accept any proposal where software and/or hardware must be installed on our system.  So, it shouldn't matter what kinds of computers we have.  

Q 13 Is this a new request for quotation not related at all to the previous request?   What is different on the RFQ that wasn't on the previous RFQ? Was the previous RFQ awarded? 
A 13 This should be considered as the only solicitation to meet current requirements. No award was made before. 

Q 14 Are all employees salaried employees? The reason for asking this is that T&A systems usually track hourly employees. Salaried employees are paid automatically with exceptions noted within the payroll system; vacations, illness, unpaid leave, etc. - there is no need for Time Clocks. 
A 14 Employees are generally salaried, but the system must be able to accommodate part-time and temporary workers. 
 
Q 15 What specific capabilities must the Time and Attendance system have?
A 15 The system should be flexible enough to be used in many ways.  We are looking for the best off-the-shelf system at the lowest price.  We want to be able to enter our time and attendance information into the system and have it feed directly into the payroll system". 

Q 16 : s there a need for lien, garnishment or child support payments?  
A 16 Yes, although such payroll offsets are not common, the need may arise from time to time.

Q 17 Do you have a requirement for checks, stubs, and reports to be generated at your location or are we express shipping documents? 
A 17 We should be able to print the reports and stubs right out of the system.  No checks. 
 
Q 18 If you are printing checks locally, do we quote for reams of check-formatted blank paper or alternatively specify our suppliers?  
A 18 We don't send checks.  All employees receive ETF from the Treasury.  
 
Q 19 What happens when an employee does not provide a valid US bank account? 
A 19 They are not allowed to work for USAID. 

Q 20 Do we cut a paper check, or reverse the transaction for local disbursement? 
A 20 Absolutely no paper checks allowed.  Employees will receive pay stubs, but not checks.  We should be able to print the pay stubs right out of the system. 
 
Q 21 Do we need to provide ATM cards for employees without valid US bank accounts? 
A 21 No 

Q 22 Alternatively, can we deposit payrolls into employee travel cards? 
A 22 No 
  
Q 23 You have not indicated a requirement to validate employee social security numbers, provide Justice Forms I-9, etc. Are you certifying that all employees are US citizens or have the proper Green Cards? 
A 23 All US citizens and have valid SS numbers.  . 
 
Q 24 Who will be responsible for ensuring the accuracy and validity of Social Security Numbers?
A 24 USAID?

Q 25 Where are the employees headquartered?
A 25 Most are headquartered in Egypt and other Middle East countries. However all salary payments are made to the employees bank accounts in the US.

Q 26 For how many states will State Tax withholding and reporting be required?  
A 26 Although State Tax withholding and reporting will generally be limited to a few states, proposals should identify any increased costs associated with processing for multiple states.? 

Q 27 Are you exempt from Workers Compensation insurance? 
A 27 Yes 

Q 28 Do we need to calculate a self-insurance? 
A 28 No
 
Q 29Unemployment - are you exempt from Federal and State unemployment funds or do we calculate into the Federal fund at the higher 6.2% rate without ceilings? 
A 29    We are exempt
 
Q 30 You indicated a direct deposit requirement previously. Are you accessing a bank for that service (provide a file) or are we? If you are, we need to know the format for the bank. Standard NACHA formats are often a jumping off point for a bank.  
A 30 Contractor will not be paying the employees.  Payments are the responsibility of USAID.
 
Q 31 If we are providing a file for your use in direct deposits, we presume you absorb the bank fees for batch transmission, stop payment, etc? 
A 31 We are a US government organization and use the US Treasury to pay our bills.  The contractor will not be making the payments to the employees.  USAID will. 
 
Q 32 Is there a requirement for non-scheduled special payrolls? If an employee doesn't get paid for any number of reasons, do we await the next cycle, or create a special payroll?  
Q 32 Either way would be fine.  We usually correct it the following pay period. 
 
Q 33 Your requirement for a toll  free telephone number for customer service is daunting. Very few Middle Eastern, Asian, or African countries are serviceable on a toll free basis. There is the exception of International Callback, but we do not have an authorization to skip past the local telephone authorities' billing systems, do you? 
A 33  We have a US based telephone system, so we only require a toll free number within the US.  If you have a 1-800 number, then that is enough.

Q 34 Are you exempt from national treaties about international callback? 
A 34 N/A 
 
Q 35 Instead, could you use an Autovon circuit to dial to a US toll-free number? 
A 35 N/A 

Q 36 Are there payments to local government authorities? 
A 36 No payments to local government authorities. 
 
Q 37 Are you considering ex-PATs and their tax exemptions within this   quotation? Usually if ex-PATs are considered part of a contract, payments to local taxing authorities have to be considered too - e.g . taxes to the nation where the employee is working.  
A 37 Our employees do not pay local taxes.  USAID only deducts US federal tax for their income.
 
Q 38 Similarly, is there a 1099 payment requirement?
A 38 No.
 
Q 39 Insurances, medical policies, cafeteria plans, pretax exemptions, etc. - are we required to send paper checks for these services? 
A 39 No paper checks will ever be sent for any reason. 

Q 40  Is there a requirement to manually enter other systems to key in employee data, earnings or payments? Or are we providing reports on a memorandum basis? 
A 40 USAID should enter time and attendance information into the contractor's website.  The contractor will process the payroll and send us a payroll report showing all income and deduction items. 
 
Q 41 Data security & the Privacy Act. What are you expecting for a certification? Could you show a generic contribution so we can understand what you are looking for?   
A 41 No.  The format isn't important.  It is up to the contractor to show whether or not they understand what is in the Privacy Act and how they comply with it.  USAID must comply with the its terms, so our contractors will as well.   The Act can be found at www.usdoj.gov/foia/privstat.htm   There are guidelines we must follow to access, protect, use, and disclose sensitive information.  Questions you may want to answer are (this is in no way a complete list):  Are written policies and procedures in place regarding collection, disclosure, use, maintenance of the system of records, system security, etc, etc of personal info, and are those policies and procedures being followed?  Who is your organization has access to the personal info, and is it necessary that these people have access to perform their duties?  Are you aware of what sort of circumstances require the disclosure of personal info?  If so, describe those circumstances. 

Q 42  Is this a question of data encryption for transmission? 
A 42  Encryption is a small part of compliance 
 
Q 43 What kind of computer are you using and what is its operating system? Are these USA IBM formatted desktop or laptop computers with Windows 98 or XP?  
A 43 Windows based systems 

Q 44 Are you trying to access demonstrations with Apple operating system computers?   (Citing Apples will generate quick No-Quotes.) 
A 44 No

Q 45 Training materials - do we presume employees using this system read and comprehend American English? 
A 45  Yes

<DESC>The following is added to the original announcement:

A major objective will be to develop sound RFP documents that clearly and comprehensively articulate the performance requirements which will be the basis for the post-award design documentation (plans and specs) to be prepared by the Contractor's Design Agent (AE #2). It should be recognized that the AE (AE #1) effort for development of the design build Request-for-Proposal (RFP) needs to be tailored to the time available for development of the RFP.  The end date (established by law) for completion of BRAC construction, dictates that the time (and thus the associated effort) for preparation of the RFP need to be streamlined. It is estimated that 12 15 weeks will be allotted for preparation of the RFP. Expected RFP development-related work tasks include the following: some overall programming; documentation of existing conditions and available utility capacities; identification of utility connection points; performance criteria coordination; incorporation into the RFP, space requirements and associated outfitting requirements (performance based)- provided by the Government; incorporation into the RFP, space adjacency requirements provided by the Government; determination of temporary swing space requirements; topographic surveys, geotechnical services/soil borings; hazardous material surveys; preparation of cost estimates and cost analyses; and post construction award services, including technical review of the design provided by the Contractor's Design Agent (AE #2). 

It is noted that in addition to the RFP encompassing medical facility requirements, the RFP will also encompass some non-medical facility requirements, such as parking structures and admin space renovations. The work that the RFP encompasses could potentially exceed $400 million.

Because this contract could eventually result in an award over $500,000.00, a subcontracting plan will be required by large business concerns.  The small disadvantaged business goal in the plan shall not be less than 15.88% of the subcontracted work.  The women-owned small business goal shall not be less than 14.22%.  A subcontracting plan is not required from firms classified as small businesses.
