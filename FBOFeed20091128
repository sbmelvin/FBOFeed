<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">MILSATCOM is a vital piece of the DoD communications architecture as it provides the space-based network connectivity needed to deliver global communications to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>tactical national security operations in areas that lack terrestrial infrastructure, as well as to mobile platforms. In order to best utilize our commercial and military satellite resources, the Department of Defense (DoD) must examine all current (and evolving) ground networking infrastructure, and terminal architecture technologies available. This examination will allow the DoD to take advantage of these capabilities and move forward on a path towards developing mitigation strategies for existing capability/requirement gaps and threats. With the current cancellation of the TSAT program, the role of the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) and Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) constellations is anticipated to expand to fill MILSATCOM capability and functionality gaps. DoD also turns to commercial SATCOM (COMSATCOM) assets to fill in essential bandwidth gaps, and appears willing to continue exploring SATCOM options such as leased capability and hosted payloads in the future.</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The operational requirements of the MILSATCOM terminal architecture are moving towards full functionality across multiple frequency bands and communication protocols. As such, future MILSATCOM architecture components (terminals, systems, ground infrastructure, etc.) should be designed with both the flexibility and adaptability to operate across different MILSATCOM satellite systems and communications layers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Commonality at the component level would increase terminal affordability and interoperability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In order for DoD to maximize the use of its existing SATCOM resources while leveraging new technologies, joint service collaboration and planning must be a part of a forward-moving strategy that focuses on; increased terminal capabilities, affordability, a unified approach to network management and connectivity, and decreased IA vulnerabilities.</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The path to develop enhanced satellite terminals is challenging because many of the legacy satellite terminals and associated satellite systems were designed to function as independent systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Integrating these legacy systems with new technologies to meet DoD demands for a more interoperable, integrated SATCOM architecture is a huge challenge. An integral piece of this new architecture is the interoperability of the space, aerial, and terrestrial communications layers. Changes in SATCOM demand (increased AISR and Communications On The Move (COTM), for example) within this integrated architecture require us to leverage legacy assets while exploring new technologies, incorporating a mix of SATCOM options to successfully meet the warfighter's operational requirements.</span></p>
