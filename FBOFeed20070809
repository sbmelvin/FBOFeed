<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Kapow Technologies, 260 Sheridan Ave., Suite 420, Palo Alto, California  94306-2407 for the following requirement: STATEMENT OF WORK TO PROVIDE WEB SERVICES SOFTWARE AND TRAINING FOR HD.GOV

BACKGROUND

Guiding the conservation and wise management of the nation?s coastal resources is a primary function of the federal government?s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  This is accomplished through a variety of mechanisms, including collaboration with state and local coastal resource management programs.

The Coastal Services Center (Center) is a division of NOAA located in Charleston, South Carolina.  The Center supports coastal managers and natural resource agencies by facilitating access to and utilization of the most up-to-date technology, information, and management strategies available in the field of coastal resource management.

This support is accomplished as the Center works with state and local programs to resolve site-specific issues.  No  project is undertaken at the Center without a state or local partner.  Over 100 projects are ongoing each year.  The technology created and the lessons learned from these efforts are then transferred to the rest of the nation?s coastal resource managers.  Detailed information on the Center is available at www.csc.noaa.gov.

An emerging need within the coastal management community has been the expressed interest in knowing more about the social, cultural and economic factors of managing our nations coastlines.  Although the information and resources available in this field are limited due to the relative novelty of this field in the coastal arena, there are many non-coastal resources to draw from and a rich opportunity for partnerships and learning from each other to better understand the relationship between people and the coasts.

The Center is working with staff from over 20 federal agencies, 15 universities, and many NGO?s who have programs focusing on the human dimensions of natural resource management to develop HumanDimensions.gov, an interagency web portal focused on the application of social science to natural resource management.  The web portal will include case studies, agency specific information, tools, methodology, policy and legislation, publications, a forum, and more.  This concept will essentially be to support a community of practice for those interested in learning more about social science tools and resources for natural resources.

SCOPE OF WORK

The purpose of this procurement is to assist the Center in developing HumanDimensions.gov (HD.gov).  Specifically, the contractor will provide software for the Web portal.  The software must extract, and integrate appropriate Web site content from partner agencies onto HD.gov.  Software must be capable of extracting content in multiple formats including:  text, charts, and photographs.  Software must be able to extract Web-based tools and applications from partner Web sites and post to HD.gov.  Additionally software must be able to apply results from one application to a secondary or tertiary application.

REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor must have expertise in software development, focusing on Web site content transfer, data integration, and the sequential co-dependent utilization of Web based applications.  Additionally, the contractor must have the ability to demonstrate their product to audiences with wide ranging backgrounds and technical experience.  Excellent communication skills, both written and oral, are required.

TASKS

This task requires the contractor to provide software for the application of Web services to partner agencies.  Specific contractor responsibilities include:
1.	Provide technical support as needed up to period of performance date. 

TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor shall make independent travel arrangements and pay for any travel costs associated with the contract in accordance with federal travel regulations.  No invitations travel will be issued to the Contractor.

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES
The C&A requirements of clause 73 do not apply, and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.

OVERSIGHT AND ACCEPTANCE

The NOAA Project Manager will provide oversight for all products and services under this contract.  The NOAA Project Manager will review, approve and authorize payments based on partial invoices submitted by the Contractor to NOAA on a monthly basis.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

The period of performance shall be from 09/24/2007 through 04/04/2009.

AFTAC requires more Matlab toolbox licenses to accommodate the growing number of users and also requires more modern tools for interacting with the operational database.  All these tools will increase the efficiency thereby saving the government time and money.  Software maintenance is required to assure that researchers have the latest technology available.  No solicitation documents exist at this time.  This item/service utilizes Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 7379 with a business size of $23.0M and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541519.

<DESC>This notice servers as a presolicitation notice / procurement synopsis for the High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) Targeting System (HTS) Production Lot 7 buy, scheduled for award in FY08.  The 328th Armament Systems Wing (328 ARSW) intends to award one (1) sole source contract for the 7th production run of HTS pods to Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS) Company, 1151 E. Hermans Rd, Tucson, AZ  85706-9367.  The authorities for going sole source are FAR 6.302-6 [10 U.S.C.(c)(6)], National Security, and FAR 6.302-1 [10 U.S.C.(c)(1)], Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Specific production requirements may include, but are not limited to, HTS pods, associated spares and support / support items [i.e. program management, engineering, logistics, test support, support equipment, spares, offset administration, and associated data].  Total production for Lot 7 is estimated to be from a minimum of 9 pods up to a maximum of 44 pods.  Deliveries for Lot 7 are anticipated to begin Nov 2009.  RMS Company, the current HTS pod producer, is presently in production; therefore, the Government will not be able to provide government property, government special tooling, and/or special test equipment to any prospective new source.  Consequently, the fulfillment of the above supplies requires substantial initial investment and an extended period of preparation for manufacture.    Should your firm desire subcontracting opportunities, contact Jon Olson (RMS Company) at the above address or phone (520) 794-2524.  The response date to this synopsis is 24 Sep 2007.  Communication concerning this acquisition should be directed to Ms. Holly Deuser, Contracting Officer, at (850) 883-0296, 693 ARSS/PK, 207 West D Ave, Bldg 349, Rm 4300, Eglin AFB, FL 32542.

The Autism Treatment Network began as a collaboration of 5 sites, and will be expanding to 12 sites.

This meeting will facilitate the expansion of the care network by providing a venue for new and returning sites to develop plans for activity for the larger network. This meeting will include formal presentations and collaborative workgroups. Specifically, veteran sites will have an opportunity to share their findings to date and report on the lessons learned in the initial development of the program. The sites of the expanded network will have the chance to develop concrete network-wide goals and objectives. Initial planning for the key consensus statements and methods to getting to consensus will be established. Moreover, key elements for the database/registry element can be reviewed and finalized. The period of performance: November 2007.The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 611430 and the Size Standard. An award to any other source would affect the NIH prior and current research.   

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Title: National Agriculture Greenhouse Gas Inventory Reporting of Soil Organic Carbon and Soil Nitrous Oxide Emissions Posting Date: August 9, 2007 Procurement Office: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Administrative Contract Service Center (3803R), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW Washington, DC 20460 Response Date: August 24, 2007 THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT, NOT A RFQ The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Climate Change Division (CCD), Program Integration Branch intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.303-1 (a)(2), to Colorado State University (CSU) in Fort Collins, CO.  The staff at CSU, are uniquely qualified to complete this work for EPA.  The CSU team has developed extensive expertise in utilizing the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change methodology for estimating soil carbon stocks in the US and remains the only group of scientists who have successfully applied the IPCC methodology to the existing US activity data for generation of national soil carbon estimates.   EPA has utilized the soil carbon estimates generated by the CSU team over the last eight years in the annual publication of the US Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks.  The Century/Daycent models, which will be used for the foreseeable future to estimate soil carbon and nitrous oxide flux from soils, were developed by a team at CSU.  Members of the CSU team have recently run these models for the US, and the soil carbon and soil nitrous oxide estimates generated from the models were utilized in 1900-2005 US Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks.    Members of the team have been working for over seven years to develop the methodology and associated documentation for the soil carbon estimates and for two years on the soil nitrous oxide estimates used in the US Greenhouse Gas Inventory.  The team contains the Lead Author on the soil carbon chapter of the recently completed 2006 IPCC Guidelines, amongst many other IPCC publications, which are used as the methodological basis for developing the greenhouse gas estimates in national inventories including the United States?.  For these reasons, the proposed team is exceptionally and uniquely qualified to undertake these tasks and present the best value to the US Government. The purpose of this acquisition is to support the national agriculture greenhouse gas inventory reporting of soil organic carbon and soil nitrous oxide emissions.  The contractor will provide the inventory estimates and the required documentation for soil organic Carbon stock changes in croplands and grasslands, and soil Nitrous Oxide emissions from all managed lands disaggregated to the state level.  The contractor will provide the Agency with text, tables and summary spreadsheets documenting the data, methods and results from the soil Carbon and Nitrous Oxide analyses; agricultural soil Carbon and Nitrous Oxide methodology annexes for inclusion in the US GHG Inventory; maps and appendices depicting variation in state-level carbon stock changes and Nitrous Oxide emissions; data inputs for the Common Reporting Format Tables; a Quality Control/Assurance Report for each inventory assessment; and responses to reviewer comments from the expert and public review comment periods. This is not a request for quotation.  No contract will awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  All inquires and concerns must be addressed in writing to U.S. EPA, Stacey Wolejko (3803R) 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20460, or to facsimile number (202) 565-2560, or sent by email to wolejko.stacey@epa.gov.  Response to this notice must be submitted within fifteen (15) days after this electronic posting.  Consideration of responses is solely within the discretion of the Government, generally for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Description:  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Bruker AXS Inc., 5465 East Cheryl Parkway, Madison WI, 53711-5373, to provide AXS D8 Discover X-ray Diffractometer with a General Area Detector Diffraction System for the Laboratory Services Division.  The AXS D8 Discover X-ray Diffractometer is a unique instrument in the scientific examination and identification of a variety of materials, to include explosives and explosives residue, which may be found in pre- or post- blast explosives evidence for ATF laboratories.   
 
The XRD meets the following requirements:
a.       The instrument must have microdiffraction capabilities
b.      The instrument must have a modular design for interchange of optics
c.       The instrument must have image and data recording capabilities 
d.      The instrument shall be compatible with the most current XRD system employed in the ATF laboratory system to satisfy the goal of instrumentation uniformity between all ATF forensic laboratories.  This is critical for sharing technical information and joint methods development between the laboratories.
e.	The instrument must have the two-dimensional HiStar detector and laser-video targeting system for fast and two-dimensional detector available for collection of diffraction data.  
f.	The system must have the patented laser- video cross hair targeting system, which  permits collection from samples or spots as small as 10 microns and simultaneously records both image and data.  For forensic applications, this provides an unquestionable record of evidence. 
g.	The system must have the HI-STAR Super Speed detector, a two-dimensional detector, which is the fastest and most sensitive detector available from any x-ray diffraction system manufacturer.  It has 80% quantum efficiency, collects up to 65 degrees 2 theta, and in conjunction with laser/video provides real time data collection and display.
 
This procurement utilizes the procedures under FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  Vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration Database at www.ccr.gov to receive this award.  Award will be made on an all or none basis.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to award a twelve (12) month sole source purchase order with two one-year option periods, to Thomas Scientific Inc., 3501 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 191043302, for Journal Usage Reports.  NIST librarians and administrators must be able to provide relevant and useful literature resources to NIST researchers.  In order to do this, a tool that has the ability to combine journal usage data, journal citation metrics, institutional publication data, and article-level data to obtain quantifiable statistical data providing a systematic, objective method for evaluating an Institution?s collection is needed.  To obtain article level data, the tool must integrate with the Web of Science already used by NIST.  To obtain journal citation metrics the tool must intergrate with Journal Citation Reports, already used by NIST. To obtain institution publication data, the tool must be able to accept institutional information about its researchers and projects, and to generate reports on who has published and where, creating a matrix of information-qualitative and quantitative to truly evaluate collection holdings.  The tool must be able to serve NIST when it is adding new research programs.  The tool must be able to identify which journals in that subject area NIST already subscribes to, how often each title is being used, and what is necessary to develop NIST collections to capably support this research front.  The tool must provide unbiased information in the matrix style above for NIST administrators to consider when funding new programs.  The tool must be able to efficiently collect, compile, and analyze usage reports from all the publishers.  Journal Usage Reports is the only product that NIST is aware of that meets these requirements.  Journal Usage Reports is created and distributed solely by Thomson Scientific.
The Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to meet the requirement and objectives as described in this synopsis.  Capability statements may be e-mailed to Barbara.Guise@nist.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not a request for quotation. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quot es are being requested via this synopsis and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Requisition Number W912HZ-07-G-8579 is being issued as a request for quotes (RFQ) with intent to award as a simplified acquisition.  The solicitation document and inco rporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12.  The US Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement for: 2 each data acquisition base system and 1 each data acquisition vision system.  The purpose of this purc hase is to provision MSB (Mobility Systems Branch) with a system to accommodate data acquisition needs in vehicle testing.  This system will replace aging, bulky, and limited equipment used in MSB for over 20 years.  The replacement system will need to acc ommodate needs for the next decade.  Nature of Instrumentation and Data Collection at MSB.  Various vehicles are instrumented and tested in austere environments.  Environmental conditions include high humidity, high temperature, winter conditions, and dust .  Instrumentation and data collection equipment is subjected to shock and vibration during testing.  Support vehicles and test crew travel to remote sites for testing.  During vehicle testing, some data reduction is necessary to ensure sufficient data is captured.  Therefore, real-time, remote monitoring of some test parameters is needed.  Standoff distance is sometimes up to four miles with LOS, but is usually ~250 meters.  There are several types of vehicle tests conducted.  There are occasionally irregu lar tests.  Increasingly, tests are being conducted on small unmanned vehicles.  Occasionally, test data is classified.  The number of parameters measured varies according to test types.  Some tests require synchronized recording of measurements from over 16 sensors. At times, there is more than one vehicle being tested where the test is for a different purpose.  Video and photographs are used to document test procedures.  Video and photographs are also used to document or annotate data collection events.  Unmanned veh icle systems rely on various vision systems for operation.  Vision as a sensor is part of unmanned vehicle study and a useful in alignment, identification, and gauging.  Cameras used in machine vision come with a variety of interfaces including CameraLink,  analog, IEEE 1394, and USB. MSB Vehicle Tests: Standard Tests:  (1) drop-test (natural frequencies); (2) draw-bar pull; (3) single wheel tire tests; and (4) ride dynamics (a) shock and (b) rms (driver absorbed power) Other Tests:  (1) acceleration / deceleration; (2) slalom / lane change; (3) traverse Sensors: (1) strain; (2) speed (pippers) (Hall-effect sensors); (3) acceleration; (4) location (GPS); (5) distance (string payout); (6) thermocouple; (7) inclinometer; (8) gyroscope Requirements for MSB Data Acquisition Base System (2 each) System must allow wireless monitoring and control of data acquisition system.  Wireless communication components must withstand shock up to 30g half-sine.  Wireless communication components must meet or exceed distance and throughput performance of 802.11g .

Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of Dell Enterprise Systems Silver Service extended warranties for Dell servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST/II owns and has in use several Dell servers, Dell PowerEdge 6650, Dell PowerEdge 1750, and Dell PowerEdge 2650.  This Dell tape library is used to support Domestic Operations at SA-1.  The warranties for four (4) Dell PowerEdge 6650s expired on October 27, 2006, sixteen (16) Dell PowerEdge 1750s expired on April 13, 2007, two (2) Dell PowerEdge 1750s on April 14, 2007, and the five (5) Dell PowerEdge 2650s expired on April 15, 2007; the hardware is no longer covered by Dell.  The servers, however, are still in use and are an essential part to CA/CST/DO.  By extending the warranty and reinstating the equipment, CA can ensure that Dell will provide hardware and software troubleshooting after business hours or over the weekend, followed by on-site service and parts when necessary. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. Due to CAs investment and overall satisfaction with the Dell tape library and the service Dell provides, it would be counter-productive and unnecessarily costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.  CA/CST believes that it is critical to the ongoing operation of Consular Systems to continue service for the Dell tape library.  Because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Governments best overall interests to procure and use this particular product.<BR><BR>

<DESC>FA2823-07-R-0026 Questions and Answers 2:

1. Question: When attaching the optical polygon, is it acceptable to attach the optical polygon to the back side of the position transducer or will you require that the optical polygon be mounted to the gimbal itself? 

Answer: We are measuring the gimbal position error at varying commanded positions.  As long as the optical polygon is attached to the gimbal to measure the gimbal position/movement we will be satisfying the position requirement of the acceptance test.  Therefore, the optical polygon should be attached to the gimbal itself.

2. Question: Should we quote systems with less accuracy as an option since the original mechanical portions of these systems were not designed to meet these specifications?

Answer: There should be no problem meeting system accuracy specs.  Therefore, you should NOT quote systems with less accuracy as an option.

<DESC>Questions and Answers FA2823-07-R-0026:
1. Position Accuracy and Repeatability vary greatly depending on the method used to measure the angle. Is it acceptable to take the measurements off the back of the readout package rather than off the actual gimbal even though it is not an accurate indication of the actual angle of the system? 
Answer: No.  Due to possible inaccuracies of the feedback/readout packages the gimbal angle itself must be measured independent of the feedback/readout package.  Possible measurement may be obtained by using an optical polygon and a theodolite containing the required accuracy measuring capability.

2. These specifications look like position transducer specifications and not the actual accuracy of the system? If this is the transducer specification, what is the specification for the system? If it is the system specification, should we quote lesser accuracy variations also as meeting these accuracy will require extensive mechanical modifications if it is achievable at all?

Answer: The question seems to be unclear.  However, solicitation presented ?system? specifications.

<SUBJECT>S -- Distributed Generation of Department of Defense Installations in the State of Hawaii

<CONTACT>Mark Asato, Contract Specialist, Phone (808) 471-5691, Fax (808) 471-5881, Email DodHiGen@navy.mil
<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) will be hosting an Industry Forum on 15-16 August 2007 at the Lanai Ballroom, Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Kaneohe Bay Officers Club, on the island of Oahu.  The Forum will focus on the acquisition of Distributed Generation, with an emphasis on renewable energy, for DoD installations in the State of Hawaii.  The intent of the Forum is to identify responsible sources and to obtain information in regard to soliciting proposals for Distributed Generation (DG) for various military installations in the State of Hawaii.  These installations include but are not limited to: Naval Station Pearl Harbor (includes Pacific Command; Commander, Pacific Fleet; Commander, Navy Region Hawaii; Commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet; Fleet Industrial Supply Center, Pearl Harbor; Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station, Pacific; Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility; Naval Security Group Department, Kunia; Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility; Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command Activity Pacific; Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific and Hawaii; and Navy Exchange); Pacific Missile Range Facility, Kauai; 15th Air Lift Wing, Hickam AFB; Schofield Barracks; Fort Shafter; and Marine Corps Base Hawaii (includes MCBH Kaneohe Bay; and Camp Smith).  To register for the Industry Forum, please visit the website at:  https://portal.navfac.navy.mil/navfacpac. 

In 2004, the combined military branches in Hawaii controlled 236,303 acres.  On the island of Oahu, the military controls 85,718 acres.  Collectively in calendar year 2006, the military consumed 1,198,800 MWhrs with a consolidated electric bill of $187 Million.
Specifically, the DoD desires to acquire power generated from conventional and alternative fuel sources, and renewable energy sources as defined in Executive Order 13423 ((renewable energy) means energy produced by solar, rooftop solar, wind, biomass, landfill gas, ocean (including tidal, wave, current and thermal), geothermal, municipal solid waste, or new hydroelectric generation capacity achieved from increased efficiency or additions of new capacity at an existing hydroelectric project).  Energy displacement projects, such as solar water heaters that displace heating energy, are not part of this scope, unless innovatively combined with another generating technology.  The current requirement is for all generation to be produced on the military installation.  It is the desire of the DoD that the generation plants will be developed, constructed, owned, operated and maintained by a non-federal government entity or entities.
The desire of the DoD is to purchase power without any direct interest in the ownership or responsibility for the operation or maintenance of the generation assets.  The DoD may consider several procurement authorities and contract formats to accommodate this acquisition; for example, a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), a Public Private Venture (PPV), and/or an Enhanced Use Lease (EUL).  The DoD may consider other alternatives if deemed beneficial to the government.
Specific sites for potential distributed generation plants will be shared at the Industry Forum.
Finally, it is the DoDs intent to purchase power at a rate which is lower than what is currently being purchased for the base. Currently the electricity rate for DoD installations ranges from $0.14/kWh (installations on the island of Oahu) to $0.30/kWh (installations on the island of Kauai).
Specifically, the DoD is currently interested in identifying risks and advantages associated with awarding a contract(s) for the procurement of power, including, but not limited to; awarding a contract within a timeframe where current Federal and State Tax Credits can be applied. Unless extended by Congress, the current deadline for receiving the Federal Renewable Tax Credit is December 2008. Perceived risks are supply of material, construction timelines, Renewable Energy Credit (REC) sales and pricing, and capital financing availability.  Responses to this RFI should address these and other issues that the responder feels should be brought to the attention of the DoD.
The DoD would also like to ascertain whether the sale of power to other parties other than the DoD is either desirable and/or feasible.  In that regard, responses should address specifically what capacity or size of generation asset would be envisioned, and what acreage of land would be developed.  Furthermore, the DoD requests information in regards to an alternate arrangement for a PPA where a site for the distributed generation system would be unspecified. Responses should include considerations of site and location, limitations of site and location, market demand for power, power transmission and distribution costs, and any other pertinent information the responder deems should be brought to the attention of the DoD.  The DoD plans to provide site specific information, including capacity or size of generation asset required and acreage of land available, at the Industry Forum.
The DoD requests that interested parties submit a Statement of Interest and as a minimum provide the following information: (1) Name and location of company, type of business; (2) capability and relevant experience; (3) financial capacity to develop, construct, own, operate and maintain a distributed generation system of desired magnitude; and (4) points of contact.  It is the Governments intent with this RFI to receive Industrys Input as stated in the Statement of Interest Questionnaire.  Marketing brochures or elaborate descriptions of the company are neither necessary nor desired.
The Forum concept is to focus on the acquisition of Distributed Generation for DoD installations in the State of Hawaii.  The intent of the Forum is to identify responsible sources and obtain information in regards to soliciting proposals for Distributed Generation (DG) for various military installations in the State of Hawaii.
All information submitted will be considered proprietary and for official government use only.  Interested parties are encouraged to mark their submissions accordingly.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL (RFP), AND A CONTRACT AWARD WILL NOT BE MADE FROM THE ATTACHED STATEMENT OF INTEREST. The Statement of Interest is due thirty (30) days after this posting date. The maximum length of the Statement of Interest is seven (7) pages. POC: MARK ASATO (808) 471-5691 OR EMAIL: DoDHiGen@navy.mil

<DESC>This is modification 10 to the synopsis entitled Constellation Space Suit System (CSSS) Solicitation Number NNJ06161022R which was posted on August 2, 2006. You are notified that the Government is announcing a change in the procurement schedule. The procurement webpage is updated to show the revised procurement schedule.   The schedule is revised for two reasons.  First, draft Element Requirements Document (ERD) data will be made  available at an earlier date than originally planned, allowing potential Offerors a greater length of time to respond to the data.  Second, the proposal due date has been moved prior to the Christmas holidays in order to provide Offerors an opportunity to enjoy the holiday season.  It should be noted that the length of time between final RFP release and proposals due has been lengthened by 12 calendar days over the previous scheduled proposal development period.   The majority of the data required for the Final RFP release will be available by October 1, 2007 with the following known exceptions: 	CxP 72207, Constellation Space Suit ERD and CxP 72208, Constellation Program Vehicle Interface Element (VIE) Element Requirements Document (ERD), will be in draft form.  Drafts of these documents will be added to the CSSS Technical Library shortly. 	CxP 72002, EVA Systems Project System Requirements Document (SRD) will not have been updated by October 1, 2007 	CxP 72176, Constellation Program EVA Systems Architecture Description  Document (ESADD) will not have been updated with an updated reference approach will not have been updated by October 1, 2007 	Attachment J-16, Deliverable Items List (DIL) will not be updated to reflect the updated reference approach will not have been updated by October 1, 2007 An amendment to the Final RFP will be released that will include the baselined ERDs, an updated SRD, and an updated Attachment J-19 SRD/ERD Requirements Applicability and Verification Participation Matrix and an updated ESADD, an updated Attachment J-3, Applicable, Guidance, and Informational Documents List (if required) and an updated version of Attachment J-16, as well as any other changes identified or documents updated prior to that time.  This amendment will also indicate that the Technical Library is complete and is then frozen for proposal development purposes.	It is anticipated that the amendment release will occur around November 1, 2007.  The Technical Library will be complete by October 1, 2007, coinciding with the planned release of the Final RFP (with the exceptions identified above).  However, it may be necessary to continue to post some documents to the Technical Library in the period between October 1, 2007 (planned Final RFP release) and the November 1, 2007, the planned release of the amendment indicating the Technical Library is complete.	The Technical Library will be frozen with the release of the amendment.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to submit questions no later than one week after the amendment is issued.    The proposal due dates are also revised.  The Past Performance Proposal Volume VI is now due November 13, 2007.	Proposal Volumes I, II, III, IV, V, and VII are now due on December 20, 2007.  This change was made so that potential Offerors could complete proposal efforts prior to the typical holiday period.  The updated schedule can be viewed at: http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/csss/Updated_CSSS_schedule.doc	 You are notified that the due date for comments to the Draft RFP has not changed and remains August 17, 2007.

Besides the SF-18, technical approach plan, and access to samples of work products, is there anything else we need to submit?  Answer:  As identified in the technical evaluation criteria, qualifications of personnel need to be addressed,  including background/resumes.  A price proposal also shall be submitted detailing the firm fixed price amount.      Question #6.  We have MS Word 2003.  Will we need any additional software to handle the data tasks?

Addendum 1b - Eznis Organizational Chart

<b><a href=http://www.ustda.gov/rfp/EZNISOrganizationalChart.pdf> http://www.ustda.gov/rfp/EZNISOrganizationalChart.pdf</a></b>
e RFP solicitation should be sent to the Grantee, not USTDA.   Note that USTDA can only provide guidance on what has been stated in the RFP.  The Grantee will have the ultimate authority in deciding whether your proposal complies with the requirements of this project.
 
<u>Below are questions posed by U.S. bidders and answered by the Grantee (Eznis Airways LLC):</u>
 
<b>Question (U.S. bidder):</b> While we have pretty much finalizing our submission, we would be interested in learning more of the results of   7-8 months of Eznis operations - e.g. loads, yields, financials, operational performance of the Saabs, plus an idea of how advance bookings and forecasts look.  
 
<b>Answer (Eznis Airways LLC):</b> This is little bit hard to present at this moment, therefore, we could not provide full statistics

<b>Question (U.S. Bidder):</b> It would be interesting to learn how the airline has done in relation to your startup forecasts.  And also get your thoughts on what you perceive as your biggest problem(s) and the most positive surprise(s) to date. 
 
<b>Answer (Eznis Airways LLC):</b> In line with startup forecast maintenance, cost control, crew, engineering sourcing is hard. The positive side is actually we surprised by real potential of market after observation of few months operation.

<b>Question (U.S. Bidder):</b> We are also anxious to learn more of the government's current posture toward de-monopolization of international routes (e.g. authorizing Eznis to compete with MIAT or be awarded sole route authority on some specific routes). 
 
<b>Answer (Eznis Airways LLC):</b> We believe Government wants to de-regulate international routes. There is no principal legal barrier exists.

<b>Question (U.S. Bidder):</b> Given the lack of progress on privatization, we believe that pressure could be brought to bear on the government to open up the international market - and look forward to working with you on this.

<DESC>Questions received for "Sources Sought Synopsis" N61339-07-SS-0073


A.         Please state whether courseware and curricular materials will be provided by NAWC TSD or if the contractor will be required to develop them.  ANSWER:The courseware and curricular materials will NOT be provided by NAWC TSD. The curriculum will be developed by the vendor and approved / accepted by the Government Learning Centers [i.e. approving Centers'; Center for Surface Combat Systems (CSCS) and Center Information Dominance (CID)]. CSCS AND CID will expect the vendor to maintain the courses by keeping them relevant and current. Any new courses or existing course overhauls will require a separate contract with a Statement of Work (SOW) that specifies the requirements.  B.  Please specify the duration of each course of instruction.  ANSWER:(1) Over the Horizon-Targeting/Command, Control, Communication, Computers and Intelligence (OTHT C4I); one (1) week (2) Command Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I SYS ENG); one (1) week (3) Information Technology for the 21st Century for Managers (IT21 For Managers); three (3) days (4) Common Operational Picture Advanced (COP Advanced); one (1) week (5) Information and Communications Manager Course (ICMC); three (3) weeks (6) Tactical Tomahawk Weapons System Engineering (TTWS-E); one (1) week (7) Information Professional Officer Basic Course (IP Basic); two (2) weeks C.  Please clarify the number of course offerings per year; is the requirement for a total of 100 courses/year or for 700 courses/year. ANSWER: Total courses will be approximately 100 per year, but this will vary according to the Centers' schedule. The following is a break out of the number of courses that were taught last year (past history); (1) Over the Horizon-Targeting/Command, Control, Communication, Computers and Intelligence (OTHT C4I); 6 each (2) Command Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I SYS ENG); 40 each (3) Information Technology for the 21st Century for Managers (IT21 For Managers); 2 each (4) Common Operational Picture Advanced (COP Advanced); 42 each (5) Information and Communications Manager Course (ICMC); 12 each (6) Tactical Tomahawk Weapons System Engineering (TTWS-E); 2 each (7) Information Professional Officer Basic Course (IP Basic); 4 each
D.  Please identify, at least hypothetically, the worldwide
Locations where courses will be offered and the number of times each course of instruction is to be offered at each location.  Businesses cannot realistically comment on their ability to support worldwide instruction without some knowledge of course venues.  The following are the locations of the classes this past year.  The number of courses at each location will vary:  Norfolk, VA, San Diego, CA, Japan, Jacksonville, FL, Seattle, WA, 
Pearl Harbor, HI, Manama, Bahrain.  Please note that the vendor will be required to provide training anywhere in the world.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management on behalf of the Substance Abuse and Mental Heath Services Administration (SAMHSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for a twelve (12) month purchase order with the National Business Group on Health (NBGH) to establish a multidisciplinary Working Committee on child adolescent behavioral health and develop an Employer Toolkit for building a benefit package for children and adolescent behavioral health. Mental health disorders and mental health problems appear in families of all social classes and backgrounds.  Roughly 20% of the U.S. child and adolescent population experience behavioral health and addictive disorders.  Approximately 7% are thought to have a severe and persistent mental illness that significantly impairs daily functioning.  In addition, an estimated 3-5% of all school children have a serious behavioral or emotional disorder. Anxiety disorders, mood disorders (such as depression), and disruptive disorders (such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) are the most common mental disorders among children.  Once a young person experiences a major depression, he or she has a greater risk of developing another depression or mental health problem within the next 5 years. An estimated two-thirds of all young people with mental health problems are not getting the help they need.  According to the 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health 5.5 million youths aged 12 to 17 (21.8 percent) who received treatment or counseling for emotional or behavior problems during 2004.  Untreated mental health problems can lead to school failure, family conflicts, substance abuse, violence, and even suicide.  Youths with mental health problems or substance abuse disorders receive treatment from a variety of sources.  Of young people aged 9 to 17 years who have a mental disorder, 27 percent receive treatment in the health sector.  An additional 20 percent of children and adolescents with mental disorders use mental health services only in their schools.  Similar to adults, children and adolescents receive a significant proportion of psychotropic medications from general medical clinicians, primarily primary care providers such as pediatricians. As with physical illness, when a child or adolescent has a mental illness, it does not only affect the child or adolescent, but the entire family.  The stress of caring for a child with mental illness may reduce a parent or caretaker?s capacity to perform well in the workplace.  Similarly, parents may be unaware of current mental health promotion efforts and treatment options.  Additionally, children and other dependents who have serious mental illnesses can affect their parents' (or other family members') work attendance.  Working parents of children with serious mental illnesses are sometimes absent from the workplace because they need to care for their children or to take them to mental health providers for treatment. The  purpose of this purchase order is to (1) create a blueprint of actionable strategies and recommendations that will enable employers to create and implement a system of affordable, effective, and high-quality child and adolescent behavioral health practices; (2)create a  working committee on child and adolescent behavioral health  to address the translation of mental health and substance use needs and services along a continuum of promotion, prevention, early identification, treatment and aftercare  into a comprehensive benefit design that aligns with the goals of the New Freedom Commission; and (3) develop an instructive toolkit to guide employers in the development of a benefit design that meets the needs of children and adolescents with mental health and substance use disorders.

The Government knows of no organizations other than the National Business Group on Health that possess the skills and resources to perform these tasks within budget (less than $100,000) and the required timeframe. The NBGH is uniquely qualified to fulfill the tasks of this purchase order for the following reasons: It is the only national nonprofit organization devoted exclusively to the analysis of health policy from the perspective of large employers with access to Fortune 500 and large private and public sector employers. The NBGH is critical in shaping health benefits designs, and testing and implementing these with their membership. No other organization is able to access these employers and their health plans and benefit managers to help carryout the tasks of this purchase order, from the environmental scan of health benefits for children and adolescents to accessing health plans and benefit managers for information on contracting requirements, and gathering employer feedback for a toolkit on developing benefit designs for children and adolescents with mental health and substance use issues.  NBGH is the only group composed of the target audience that has a track record on the analysis of health plan for its membership. NBGH is the only member organization that communicates with the senior executives who the government wants to learn about health care issues/solutions, and it has done so for over 33 years.  This simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source. Interested concerns may identify their interest in and capability to satisfy the requirement within 15 days after the date of publication of this notice. Capability statements may be submitted to Anthony Webb in Room 5-101, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857 or via email at awebb@psc.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>20 -- Shibata Rubber Blocks for Marine Drydocking
<SOLNBR>HSCG86-07-Q-66H108
<RESPDATE>082007
<ARCHDATE>09042007
<CONTACT>Bonnie Hoe, Contracting Officer, Phone 808-541-2158, Fax 808-541-2203, Email Bonnie.L.Hoe@uscg.mil
<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard Naval Engineering Unit Honolulu intends to procure 20 Shibata rubber blocks to be used in Marine Ship Drydocking applications.  At present, wooden blocks are usually used.  The height and angle of the wooden blocks are adjusted to correspond to the dimensions of each docked ship.  There has always been a need for blocks that do not need curved surface processing and that are reusable and the Government believes that these rubber blocks meet that criteria.  It is the Government?s belief that Shibata Industrial Company of Tokyo Japan is presently the only manufacturer of these rubber blocks, therefore it is the Government?s intention to procure and test these rubber blocks on USCG ships.  Here are the salient features:  

1. Dimensions:  300mmW X 600mmL X 65mmT (12? X 24? X 2.25?)
2. Steel plate embedded in 5 ply fiber reinforced rubber parallel to the 12" X 24" surface no more than 0.250" thick.
3. Pads must have counter-bored holes IAW attached drawing.
4. The pad must have a maximum service load of 64.8 Ton/ft^2. 
5. In parallel compression the pads can deflect no more than .315" under a 15 ton/ft^2 load. 
6. In shear compression the pads can deflect no more than .354" under a 15 ton/ft^2 load.
7. Upon removal of load, blocks must return to their original shapes with no appreciable deformation. 
8. Blocks must be seawater and weather resistant for a 10-20 year service life

Any and all domestic concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing the same within 10 calendar days from the day this notice is posted. The information that must be submitted includes: (1) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered material (i.e., salient physical, functional, and performance characteristics) and/or (2) Data that the offered material has been satisfactorily manufactured for the use of other Government contracts.  This data must include sufficient information to allow the Coast Guard to evaluate the information relative to the above requirements.   If not response are received within ten (10) calendar days with sufficient information to determine that another responsible source is available, the rubber blocks will be procured from Schuyler Rubber Company, Inc., 16901 Wood-Red Rd. NE, Woodinville, WA  98072.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Response to this RFI will not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  However, only respondents to this RFI will be sent an RFP if one is issued as a result of this RFI.  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is currently conducting market research to examine competitive sourcing alternatives for soil survey services to determine the existence of viable commercial sources capable of providing the necessary services. In support of NRCS field offices, USDA is seeking further information, comments, recommendations, and capabilities from interested parties with relevant experience in any or all of the following areas:   soil genesis and classification, soil survey, and technical soil services.  

Study scope includes approximately 300 soil survey scientist field positions providing services to produce, document, and deliver scientifically-based soil information by National Cooperative Soil Survey Standards to help society to understand, value, and wisely manage global resources.  The current organizational structure consists of 18 Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) Regional Offices that provide quality assurance over smaller project offices responsible for conducting soil surveys and quality control oversight within 146 assigned geographic areas covering 2.3 billion acres.  

The soil survey scientist function is sought to support the USDA NRCS mission and operational requirements for full field, laboratory, and technical support for the Soil Survey Program.  The Soil Survey Program is authorized under law and regulation and guided by executive order and secretary?s memoranda.  The Agriculture Appropriation Act of 1896 established the soil survey and subsequent laws (1903, 1928 and 1935) clarified purpose.  In 1966, Congress expanded the scope and further clarified the intent of the Soil Survey Program in Public Law 89-560, known as the Soil Survey for Resources Planning and Development Act.  

This function provides basic conservation data for the purposes of planning and application of conservation measures.  The data in many instances is complex and requires in-depth scientific analysis including laboratory investigations.  Interpretations are built from this analysis of data into tables and other formats, including computer databases, to help simplify the planning and application phases of conservation activities.  Duties include professional and scientific work in the investigation of soils, soils management, and adaptation for alternative uses.  Detail qualifications include the following: 

1.0	Conducting the survey, including field data collection and documentation, investigation, description, classification, correlation and developing and maintaining the soil geographic data for the MLRA Regional Area to include:
?	Ensuring accuracy of line placement with respect to landforms
?	Ensuring accuracy and consistency of the soil map unit attribute data
?	Ensuring soil series are mapped regionally on appropriate parent materials and landforms
?	Geo-referencing locations of sampled soil profiles and ensuring adequate representation of soil series by laboratory data
?	Quantifying distribution and extent of designated benchmark soils
?	Ensuring sufficient and appropriate benchmark soils are designated to represent the most common soils in the region
?	Creating sufficient, high quality block diagrams to represent the benchmark soils of the MLRA region
2.0	Publishing to the Web Soil Survey as areas are completed and reviewed
3.0	Reporting progress for the geographic area of responsibility
4.0	Periodically completing a review of new soil survey area data
5.0	Developing a long range work plan and investigations plan
6.0	Meeting with Soil Survey Area Technical Team which includes state staff, cooperators,  NRCS field staff, resource soil scientists, and others
7.0	Developing an annual business plan with priorities and resources requirements

Written responses must contain sufficient documentation to convey organizational capabilities to fulfill the requirements.  Interested organizations submitting a capability statement must provide the following:  1) company name and address; 2) point of contact; 3) phone/fax/email; 4) NAICS Codes; 5) business size and status; 6) capability information in response to the function requirements / description; 7) at a minimum, the American Registry of Certified Professionals in Agronomy, Crops, and Soils (ARPACS) professional soil scientist certification; requirements for the Office of Personnel Management 470 Occupational Series, or applicable state soil scientist certification are required for all soil survey scientist positions; and 8) past experience describing similar projects.  Clearly identify any information considered to be sensitive or proprietary.

<DESC>Prior to 27 September 2007 and based on FAR Part 6.301-2 criteria (services that will satisfy agency needs are only available from one source), Federal Student Aid intends to award, on a sole source basis and using FAR Part 12 (commercial) procedures, a 2-year bridge contract, to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), its incumbent data center services provider.  This bridge contract will enable the continued acquisition of data center services currently being provided by CSC, until the successor provider effectively assumes full responsibility for providing these needed data center services.  Of note, the successor provider was identified during fiscal year 2006, following completion of a recompete procurement effort.  On 23 March 2007, via FEDBIZOPS reference number VDCNotice032307, Federal Student Aid announced it intended to extend its existing commercial type outsource task order (ED-01-GS-0002), awarded to CSC under GSA FEDCAC contract GS00T97ALD0003, for the same purpose.  Subsequently, a 6-month extension was effected.   However, it has since been determined, due to various operational issues and to mitigate program risk, upwards of 18 added months may be required to fully complete this data center transition effort; FEDCAC contract GS00T97ALD0003 has now expired; and existing terms and conditions require material revision.  Award of a bridge contract, on a sole source basis, for the unique purpose stated above, will effectively address these considerations.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Sources Sought Synopsis for Additional UHF Capabilities
<SOLNBR>SPAWAR_Headquarters_MKTSVY_4A7DE
<RESPDATE>083007
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Maureen Zajano, Contract Specialist,  858-537-0675
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWARSYSCOM), on behalf of the Program Executive Office Space Systems and its Communications Satellite Program Office (PMW-146), is seeking to identify responsible prime sources (i.e. prime contractor or contracting teams) that can provide narrowband Military Communications (MILCOM) satellite services [i.e. Ultra-High Frequency (UHF)] beyond that currently provided or under contract for future use. The UHF Follow-On (UFO) constellation, procured from Boeing Satellite Systems, Inc. (Los Angeles, CA) under contract N00039-88-C-0300, currently provides the warfighter its narrowband communications needs.  For reference, the last satellite (F11) added to the UFO constellation has a design lifetime of 14 years and a payload with 41 channels:  one (1) broadcast channel of 25 kHz bandwidth; 17 relay channels of 25kHz bandwidth; and 23 narrowband channels of 5 kHz bandwidth; plus one (1) EHF uplink and downlink channel for commanding the spacecraft.  The warfighter also uses additional UHF capabilities (five 25kHz channels) from G2 Satellite Solutions Corporation (Washington D.C.) under the LEASAT services contract N00039- 05-C-0022. The Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) constellation, currently being procured from Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (Sunnyvale, CA) under contract N00039-04-C-2009, is the next generation narrowband Military Satellite Communications system that will replace the UFO system.   Operational availability of the first MUOS satellite is scheduled for March 2010 with final satellite delivery scheduled for March 2014. For any additional UHF capabilities, the U.S. Navy is considering the use of firm- fixed-price contracts via FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and possibly service-based only (leasing) acquisitions.  Please note that the Government will consider UHF services from satellites that may contain other bandwidth (e.g., C-band) channels for other customers, provided that priority consideration is given to meet UHF service needs. Though not the preferred Government approach, if the interested party first requires Government funding to complete any engineering development (i.e. not manufacturing and applicable only to providing additional UHF capability), such effort would be contracted using FAR Part 15 with services options via FAR Part 12. The Government will not consider any arrangement that requires a multi-year (see FAR Part 17) contracting approach or termination of liability if any services options are not exercised. At a minimum, these Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) capabilities must be interoperable with current military UHF terminals and telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C) system without changes to the integrated waveform. It is important to note that the Government prefers additional  UHF capabilities to be provided sooner rather than later (i.e. less capability short-term is preferred over waiting longer for greater capability). Accordingly, the Government requires that any interested party identify the earliest availability date it can provide any UHF capabilities. Each interested party shall describe the range of its qualifications, including the feasibilty of providing UHF capabilities available at its earliest delivery date (month and year)  via its lowest risk (technical and schedule)/most affordable solution with the related risk level (technical and schedule) and rough order of magnitude (ROM) price. THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE, but rather this is a sources sought synopsis in order for the Government to identify interested sources that are capable of providing these narrowband military communications satellite efforts.  The purpose of this sources sought is to identify potential prime sources that: (1)   can adequately demonstrate their current capabilities; and (2)   have a detailed plan of action that shows the ability to meet satellite capability service requirements within executable schedules and corresponding ROM prices as well as contracting approaches required to perform accordingly. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized under separate cover on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website.  Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  The information requested herein will be used to support a potential solicitation issued in 4th quarter FY07 or 1st quarter FY08 that will result in a contract award as early as the end of the 2nd quarter of FY08.  All information provided below is for planning purposes and is subject to change. The satellite, whether already produced or to be produced, must be designed for stabilization in geosynchronous orbit to ensure that the antennas are constantly maintained in an earth pointing orientation.  The spacecraft must provide the necessary power to support the mission requirements during those periods when the satellite is in eclipse.  The spacecraft must provide the essential support functions for the control of the communications payload, and must accommodate and provide essential support functions for operation of the Communications Security (COMSEC) Equipment used for TT&C.  The TT&C equipment must provide all necessary functions for the control of the satellite and communications payload. Any prime sources (i.e. prime contractor or contracting teams) shall reply to this synopsis if they are interested in proposing for this potential future narrowband satellite communications effort.  Interested offerors shall submit qualification packages generally describing their capabilities and satellite designs for meeting this requirement.  Packages shall be in the form of a narrative statement not exceeding 10 face pages double-spaced and a slide presentation (e.g., MS PowerPoint) not exceeding 25 slides.  Interested offerors shall submit their qualification packages via the SPAWAR E-commerce website to the SPAWAR contracts point of contact, Ms. Maureen Zajano. Replies should be submitted by 4:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) on Thursday, Aug 30th, 2007.  After reviewing the responses, Government may contact a prime source for a live presentation (telecon, VTC, or in-person, not to exceed 90 minutes) of its response. Any live presentations, if requested, must be made no later than Friday, September 14th, 2007. This is NOT a request for proposals. Proprietary data in responses will be protected where so designated.  All respondents should indicate their company size status and the extent to which they can include small business participation (of all small business categories listed in FAR 19.7).   If proposing a solution yet to complete manufacturing, the contractor size status is based on NAICS Code 334220 with an SBA size standard of 750 employees.  If proposing a solution that in involves services only, the contractor size status is based on NAICS Code 517410 with an SBA size standard of $12.5M.  Partnering between small and large businesses is encouraged.  Responses received in reply to this notice may, in part, be used to make a determination of the level of competition for the resulting solicitation [e.g., full and open competition, SB set-aside, 8(a) set- aside, etc.]. Given the potential size and complexity of the proposed satellite utilized to fulfill the performance requirement, the Navy expects that the qualification packages submitted will describe the mature satellite design (whether satellite is already built or not) including: 1) define the satellite architecture to be used to meet the performance requirements and affordability constraints at verifiable and acceptable levels of risk; 2) describe the specifics of the system production, deployment, and operations processes; 3) identify key technical risk items and key cost drivers and demonstrate how they will be managed; 4) if the satellite to be used is not already in orbit, demonstrate the capability to achieve operation in orbit; 5) provide spacecraft information including satellite size, weight and power breakdowns to the payload and bus unit level with sufficient detail to demonstrate how spacecraft weight and power consumption estimates and margins were derived; technical descriptions of key spacecraft hardware and software components such as antennas, deployment mechanisms, feeds, filters, receivers, transmission lines, processors, and transmitter subsystems; and spacecraft reliability estimates to show that all performance requirements will be met; 6) technical descriptions of UHF payload in adequate depth to clearly demonstrate requirements satisfaction; signal analysis showing attainment of critical technical parameters such as gain, noise figure, dynamic range, linearity, efficiency, isolation, Gain to Noise Temperature (G/T), Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP), intermodulation products, out of band emissions, signal processing, and any other key technical parameters affecting performance; 7) bus architecture information including functional block diagrams of the satellite bus and technical descriptions of key bus subsystems that clearly demonstrate requirements satisfaction; technical descriptions of all key bus subsystems including power, attitude control, propulsion, TT&C, thermal control and any other bus subsystems required for proper spacecraft operation; and 8) a ROM price (by Government fiscal year) for providing the UHF capability and, if satellite not yet on orbit, delineate the portion of the ROM price attributed to completion of engineering development applicable to the UHF capability only.  If an interested party believes its solution to meeting the Governments requirements does not meet the FAR 2.101 definition of commercial item and that FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items does not apply, it shall state so, provide the rationale for such interpretation, and clearly specify its qualification package is based on an acquisition using FAR Part 15 only and what contract type.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center in Huntsville, Alabama (CEHNC) is planning an acquisition for the procurement of utility metering data management system(s) pursuant the Energy Policy Act of 2005 which requires Federal facilities to be me tered for purposes of managing energy consumption including water.  The plan is to install advanced meters at approximately 6,500 facilities at more than 480 Army installations, Army Reserves and Army National Guard facility locations worldwide.  These adv anced meters will electronically transmit their data to central data management system(s) for consumption analysis and reporting.  Regional and installation-centric meter data management systems are currently envisioned.

<SUBJECT>R -- Notification of MAS EXPRESS PHASE 2 ROLL-OUT on August 15 2007
<DESC>On January 16, 2007, the General Services Administration, Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) introduced Phase I of the MAS Express Program (referred to as ?MAS Express? in this document).  MAS Express is a pilot program designed to reduce the time it takes to get a basic GSA Schedule contract. During Phase I, the core criteria of the program was established, and specific Schedules and Special Item Numbers (SINs) were selected to participate. 
On August 15, 2007 FAS is scheduled to roll out Phase II of MAS Express.  Under Phase II, FAS has increased the number of Schedules participating in the program from 5 to 15, and the number of Special Item Numbers (SINs) in the program is also increasing.  In addition to the expansion, the program is also being enhanced to provide our Industry Partners the ability to submit electronic MAS Express Program offers under Express EOffer.  Initially, the ability to submit an Express eOffer will be available for specific schedules.  This feature will be expanded over the coming months. 
MAS Express offers several benefits to GSA customers and prospective GSA Industry partners.  The near-term benefit will result in a reduction in the amount of time it takes to process an offer.  This will make selected products and services available quicker to GSA?s customers.  The program will also allow for streamlined collaboration and communications between our Industry partners and GSA Contracting personnel.
Besides meeting MAS Express offer criteria Offerors are required to successfully complete the ?Pathway to Success? course.
The ?Pathway to Success? course is available via live sessions or online at http://vsc.gsa.gov, Vendor Training. The primary function of the  ?Pathway to Success? course?s is to provide our Industry partners information about the MAS Schedules program so that potential Offerors can make an informed business decision as to whether it is in their best interests to have a MAS contract.  Another important objective of the course is to improve the quality of Schedules offers submitted by our Industry partners. The ?Pathway to Success? course includes discussion sessions covering:
-	the proposal submission process and the MAS solicitation
-	the obligations involved in being a Schedule contractor
-	How an Offeror must differentiate their firm (through; pricing, service, delivery, and/or terms conditions) in order to be successful in the Federal marketplace.
Individuals who satisfactorily complete the ?Pathway to Success? course will receive certificates, which they must submit with their offer. The certificates are valid for one year, and the firm?s employee who completes the course must still be employed by the firm at the time a proposal is submitted. 
Additional MAS Express Eligibility Requirements:
To be eligible for the MAS Express, a company must first offer products/services from one of the participating Schedules. The eligible SINs are product/service specific (with associated maintenance).
   Selected SINs from the Schedules listed below are in the MAS Express Program.
36 The Office, Imaging & Document Solution  
71 III Special Use Furniture
48 Transportation, Delivery, & Relocation   
73 Food Service, Hospitality, Cleaning, Equipment
51 V Hardware Superstore  75 Office Products/Supplies & Services
58 I Professional Audio/Video Telecommunications, & Security Solutions	
78 Sports, Promotional, Outdoor, Recreational Trophies, & Signs (SPORTS)
67 Photographic Equipment ? Cameras,
Photographic Printers & Related Supplies and Services (Digital Film Based)	
81 IB Shipping, Packaging, & Packing Supplies
69 Training Aids, Devices, Instructor-Led Training; Course Development; Test Administration	
599 Travel Service Solutions
70 General Purpose Commercial Information Technology, Equipment Software & Services	
899 Environmental Services
71 I Office Furniture	

In addition, Offerors must meet all other MAS Express criteria. The basis of the program criteria is to demonstrate that the Offorer?s company is financially sound, has a proven track record of sales and is willing to offer GSA its best pricing.
Additional information on MAS Express criteria requirements can be found at www.gsa.gov/masexpress and in the MAS Express Program ?Letter to the Offeror,? which is located with the Solicitation of each Schedule in the program.
Vendors may obtain additional information regarding MAS Express by accessing the Vendor Support Center (VSC) at http://vsc.gsa.gov and clicking on the "Business Opportunities" tab. For questions specifically related to MAS Express, vendors may contact the Schedule Program Express Evaluation Desk at (312) 886-8897.

We strongly encourage you to respond to our questions, the responses do not have to be formal but we would like to have industrys perspective on these to pics.  The white papers were requested by 3 August, 2007, to david.kimzey@us.army.mil, however responses will be accepted through August 20, 2007.  PM SKOT intends to set aside time to meet individually with interested contractors at their request to discu ss information contained in the White Papers.  The purpose of these individual meetings is to ensure PM SKOT understands the contents of the information provided as well as to provide a confidential forum for contractor specific questions or comments about  their companys participation in the SKO segments.  While the Government may use appropriate general information or ideas gathered from the responses during the general sessions, we will not share company confidential information marked proprietary during  the conference.  To assist with this, please ensure you include the appropriate proprietary markings on any documents provided.  White Paper Topics: 1.	Problem Statement:  PM-SKOT was used to cyclical requirements generated by funding availability.  With the Single Source initiative, requirements could come in quantities that may vary from one to hundreds accompanied by short lead times for delivery. It is believed this situation mirrors that faced by industry in the commercial market place.  How can we predict or project out-year requirements in an uncertain market? Are there commercial models that can be used to predict cyclic or surge requirements?  What contracting arrangement would be attractive to industry for low density items requiring rapid deliveries?  Does industry have any recommendations on a contract vehicle suitable for this environment? 2.	Problem Statement:  As PM-SKOT moves to become the Single Source for Tools, requirements will come in from a variety of sources.  What is the most efficient means of capturing and fulfilling customer orders?  Is a web site best suited to meet these need s, and if so, are there commercial models for system and staffing requirements?   3.	Problem Statement: The current SKO contract was created to allow segments of bidders to be identified as interested and qualified to respond to requests for pricing and allow quicker lead times between identification of need and contract award while sti ll obtaining competition.  PM-SKOT is finding we are not receiving competitive bids for all of our requirements; sometimes only one segment member responds to a pricing request.  Reasons given are the number of line  items, small quantities, and short turn around times.  What type of solicitation turn around time and contractual arrangement would work best to meet expected but unquantifiable quantities and mixes of SKOT items?  Does your company have any other recomme nded changes to the current SKO contractual arrangement?   4.	Problem Statement:  The PM-SKOT environment is evolving in several ways:   a.	A Shift from primarily ID/IQ type contracts to Requirements Contracts when it makes sense. b.	The make or buy decisions involving government installation capacity. c.	The shift in funding sources, i.e.,  ratio of AWCF to PA dollars d.	A variety of sources generating requirements e.	The possibility of kitting Special Tools for the various Army Platform PMs and for other Services. What information could be or should be shared between industry partners and PM-SKOT to allow both sides to be responsive to the others needs?   Lastly, if there are interested companies unfamiliar with the SKO contract arrangement and you desire more information and background, the following is provided:  The SKO contract was set up to allow the Government to award to a pool of contractors that have been pre qualified, and  provide them with the opportunity to compete for future requirements that fall into 5 Segments as identified below: Segment 1:  Mechanical/Maintenance Tool Kits         2:  Construction/Engineer Tool Kits         3:  Specialized Tool Sets          4:  Containerized Shop Sets         5:  Vehicle/Trailer Mounted Shop Sets I've attached the link for you to view solicitation DAAE20-02-R-0193 - this link provides detailed information about the SKO contract and how proposals will be evaluated.   Any future augmentation of the pools will be done using this solicitation.  https:/ /aais.ria.army.mil/aais/Padds_web/index.html Further details will be provided at the conference concerning SKO augmentation. We are not intending to provide specific briefings during the general sessions about what Sets, Kits, Outfits, and Tools are or how to go about joining one of the SKO Contract segments, rather, we will have a breakout session for all new interested parties where a deliberate discussion about how to do this will take place.  Please contact Captain David Kimzey if you plan to attend or if you have any questions. We look forward to seeing you at the conference.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL

Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).

JUSTIFICATION

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity. 
           Agency:  39CS/SCXR
           Contracting Activity:  DISA/DITCO/PL8322, Scott AFB IL

2.  Nature/Description of Action(s).   A firm fixed price contract for the specific make and models of equipment listed on the attached spreadsheet.  The estimated cost is $108,957.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services. Purchase of materials (antennas and transmission cables with hardware) for Ground-Air Transmitter/Receiver (GATR) Site, Incirlik AB, Turkey.

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority. FAR Part 6.302-1 (10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1)

5.  Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications. 
a.    EMCOR CABINETS:   The Emcor part # AS-025132-00  Cabinet is a Series 10 Cabinet that has been modified by Emcor to  meet the requirements for installation of communication equipment (radios) specifically identified by the 85th EIG Keesler, AFB.   This cabinet is the only known suitable substitute for the MT-686 communication rack which was the AF standard but is obsolete and  no longer available for purchase.
b.	TACO antenna:  The Taco antenna was selected due to their physical characteristics including weight, profile; size and antenna transmit and receive degradation. A change in model or manufacture at this time could cause major interference and/or bleed over problem between antennas. If a substitution is made it will dictate a re-accomplishment of a new EMC Study
c.	Trylon Universal Monopole Rings:   The Trylon Universal Monopole Rings part # 5.927.0001.001 is the mounting hardware required for mounting the Taco Antennas with respect to their weight and wind loading ratings. These ratings must be maintained as catastrophic failure of the antenna installation could result. 
d.	Andrews Hanger and Cable:  The Andrews Hanger is matched to the 7/8? Heliax physical dimensions.  The Andrews Heliax cable has a very low db loss. This is a critical factor because of the length of Transmission Line between the GATR site and the antenna field.
e.	DowKey:  DowKey is the only know Supplier of this relay, part # 402-230132 which meets the requirements of the intended application for this project and can meet the required installation start date.

DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES 

0001,  SCOPE A:  New geometry layers required: Squadron labels; Flight labels: Billet labels; ZIP Code labels (PO boxes excluded, only for ZIPs in USAF data); all are centroid based Codes within Flash map.

0002,  SCOPE B:  Set-up Coding: Monthly update of all ZIP to Billet assignments -- Because of the nested structure and dependencies, this means regenerating all the polygonal layers and all labels listed in Scope A.  This monthly update will require an entire new set of ALL USAF geometry to be generated every month.  It also means retagging all schools so they show up in the right areas.

4.	Identification of Justification Rationale:  

FAR 6.302-1 (c) Application for brand name descriptions. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 
 

5.	Identification of Justification Rationale:  

The contractor must be able to provide the Brand Name EMC2 storage in order to support current network standard implementation.  EMC2 storage is the standard for the client. FEDSIM?s client maintains support of the entire network infrastructure.  EMC storage is proprietary, and the client has approved EMC as part of their enterprise architecture. These configurations must be built as a whole, and are proprietary. Installation is part of this order, with factory representatives being needed for on-site installation. Installation by other than the factory representatives would void any warranties on the equipment  FEDSIM?s client has a significant investment in terabytes of EMC storage, with over 3.5 million dollars of EMC products currently in use at the proposed location. Only the proprietary EMC storage equipment being requested will properly interface with the existing EMC2 client network infrastructure currently installed at the location. The value of this procurement, $412K, represents a very small portion of the existing installed base of EMC2 equipment in which the proposed equipment must properly interface with. Based on this, FEDSIM has determined that EMC2 storage is the only Brand Name Products that meets the needs of our client.

6.	Description of Solicitation:

This procurement will be accomplished on an open market basis utilizing the simplified acquisition procedures allowed for within FAR Part 12, ?Acquisition of Commercial Items?. All items are not available on GSA Schedule. NASA SEWP IV does not provide any significant discounts from list pricing. Market research has determined that an open market procurement would provide the Government a discount of about 50% from list pricing. This acquisition will be publisized in FedBizOps as a brand name restriction, and will be limited to competition among the OEM, and its distributors. 

7.	A Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  

After market research, FEDSIM has found that the manufacturer of EMC products may give significant discounts over list prices.  EMC has indicated that they would offer a special discount to the FEDSIM client, which is about 50% from their published list pricing. 

8.	Description of the Market Research conducted:  

The FEDSIM project manager performed searches on the internet, conducted product searches on GSA Schedule SIN 132-8 and the NASA SEWP IV, reviewed published manufacturer list pricing, submitted Market Surveys to EMC resellers, and additionally contacted the EMC manufacturer directly.

9.	Additional Facts:  

This procurement is an add-on to the current network storage system. It is imperative that FEDSIM?s client only procures equipment that is compatible with the large current investment in EMC2 network storage in order to alleviate potential integration risks, higher costs (for additional hardware, software, other vendor service contracts for another server brand) and product performance problems. Expedited delivery of 10 and 15 days will also be required. 
 

10.	Listing of sources interested in the acquisition.:

Research for this acquisition included review of both GSA Advantage and NASA SEWP online tools. Research of pricing and availability was done with EMC, and EMC distributors including Datacure, Unisys and SANZ. In addition to these firms, any other authorized resellers of the required equipment may submit an offer.  

11.	Statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  

This procurement will be limited to OEM and dealer level competition, as only the manufacturer can provide the required products. Given the proprietary nature of the items, no barriers can be removed.

12.	Certification:


?I certify that the data provided in support of this recommendation for other than full and open competition are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.?

POSITION DESCRIPTION


BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization?s programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

Documents attached to this synopsis can be accessed at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=21#126322   .  These documents include: (a) The complete Statement of Work. (b) Los Angeles International Airport, North Field Assessment, prepared for LAWA by URS Corporation, May, 2007. (c) Analysis of LAX North Airfield Alternatives, prepared for LAWA by International Aviation Management Group, Inc. May 2007. (d) Los Angeles International Airport Runway Incursion Studies: Phase III, Center Taxiway Simulation, NASA / TM-2004-212807, NASA Ames Research Center, August 2004. Requirements for this study are as follows: Must be based on historical runway safety data, traffic demand forecasts, available technology, and include a recommendation for action. A comprehensive evaluation and report of proposed airfield configuration options with principal regard to safety and operational efficiency.  Consideration must be given to projected traffic growth, accommodation of new requirements for Group VI aircraft operations, and emergent technologies or equipment that may be employed to improve safety or efficiency. Major tasks for this study are as follows: Review existing reports and development plans to understand background and prior work. Previous reports and background information that are integral to the Master Plan or Plan Amendment study will be provided by the Government and LAWA.  Identify the underlying causes of runway incursions and assess the severity of the problem, considering future traffic requirements and configuration options. This requires the review of Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) reports and other sources of Runway Incursion data for the past 20 years, considering only major incidents for those older than 10 years. Evaluate the impact of forecast fleet mix changes on the potential for future runway incursions, with special consideration of regulatory compliance for Group VI operations and potential impact of South Field operations on North Field configuration changes. In forecasts of the future traffic and fleet composition LAWA agreements for limitation of practical capacity for 2025 (2200-2300 daily operations) should be used. Analyze the likely effectiveness of specific airfield improvements (e.g. marking, signage, and lighting) for reducing potential future runway incursions, taking into account the past 20 years of runway incursions and other surface incident history at LAX. Consider the likelihood of reducing the potential for runway incursions and improving operational efficiency through use of available technological improvements, such as; runway status lights (RSLs) and ASDE-X.  Prepare a report of your findings on the above items, recommending whether further action should be taken to reduce the safety risk on the North Airfield at LAX and what that action should be.    Deliverables for this study are as follows: A preliminary report of the findings and recommendations developed through the tasks listed above is required 30 days prior to contract completion. This preliminary report will be reviewed and returned for revision within 10 days of receipt. A final report of findings and recommendations, incorporating revisions required by the preliminary review is required at contract completion.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-18.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all interested quoters may submit a quote.

The Manufacturing Process Metrology Group (MPMG) of the Manufacturing Metrology Division (MMD) in the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory (MEL) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires a small three-axis tool force measuring transducer (also referred to as a cutting force or machining dynamometer) for machining research projects.  The tool force transducer will used in an ultra-precision machining laboratory to investigate cutting processes where the cutting forces are extremely small.  Therefore high sensitivity is of major concern.  A piezo-electric type force sensor device is required because of the need for high sensitivity unless an alternate approach (strain gage or optical sensor) can be demonstrated to be as sensitive as a quartz piezo-electric type sensor element and further that all the following specifications such as the natural frequency and stiffness requirements are met.


The technical specifications presented here cover a three-axis tool force transducer and all associated essential supporting equipment such as electronics and cables for providing machining cutting force measurements down to below the one Newton (N) range .  The tool force transducer shall be composed of multiple internal sensing elements to compensate for forces being applied at locations other than the exact center line of the loading platform.  The dynamic output of the transducer will be recorded by an existing NIST digital oscilloscope not covered in this specification. 

LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each Three Axis Tool Force Measuring Transducer, meeting all of the following required specifications: 
  
1. Overall size of the transducer shall be less than or equal to 80 mm by 75 mm by 25 mm.   

2. Mounting holes shall be provided in the tool force transducer structure for attaching the transducer to the machine tool work slide and for attaching cutting tool holders to the top or mounting platform of the transducer.  Proper mounting instructions shall be provided including a mechanical drawing showing the precise location of the mounting holes; however, all mounting bolts will be provided by the NIST. 

3. The top platform of the transducer shall have standard metric or English tapped holes for mounting the cutting tool holder assembly.  

4. 
Output cables and attachment connectors to the dynamometer unit must be leak tight to normal cutting fluids such as pure mineral oil or water soluble oil and the transducer shall be constructed of rust proof materials. 

5. The tool force transducer and all associated electronics and cables shall be factory new, not rebuilt or used.

6. The tool force transducer shall be an existing commercial product especially designed for the machining environment and not a developmental model, an experimental model, or a one-of-a-kind device.

Cutting Force Range and Sensitivity:

7. All three orthogonal axis components (x, y, and z direction) shall have a maximum force capability of at least plus or minus 250 N.  In other words, the transducer is required to be usable to measure forces in a range of ? 250 Newton to + 250 Newton (- 56 pounds to + 56 pounds) without requiring a preload.

8. A minimum force that can be sensed, or threshold force, is 0.002 Newton 

9. The output sensitivity shall be greater than or equal to 10 pico-Coulombs per Newton or better in all three directions. 

10. The cross talk between different axes shall be plus or minus 2 % or less.  (For example, if a precisely perpendicular force of 100 Newton is applied in the z-direction, the falsely indicated force in the x and y axes shall be less than 2 % of that force (in this example less than 2 Newton).  The cross talk specification shall apply to any force applied within the area of the top tool mounting platform area.

11. The calibrated sensitivity for each axis shall be stated in the technical data supplied with the dynamometer such that the sensitivity can be set on the charge amplifier.

12. The calibrated sensitivity shall apply over the complete area of the top tool mounting surface or platform of the transducer.  (The effect of the moment on the transducer for a force not perfectly centered shall be compensated for in the design of the transducer.)   For example, if a 100 Newton force is applied anywhere within the tool mounting platform area, the indicated value shall be the correct value within 2 % (2 Newton in this example).

Natural Frequency and Stiffness: 

13. The tool force transducer shall be used in experimental configurations where it is desirable to have has high of frequency-band width as practical; therefore, the natural frequency is of major concern for this dynamometer.  A natural frequency (with no mass attached to the dynamometer mounting surface) of 5 kHz or higher is required for measuring dynamic forces in all three axis directions.

14. Stiffness or rigidity must be a minimum of 250 Newtons per micrometer in all three axes.

Operating Temperature Range:

15. The transducer shall be operable in a temperature controlled environment at 15 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius. 

Output Amplifier Electronics:

16. A charge amplifier type electronic system with three channels is a must have feature.  The charge amplifier system must be 100 percent compatible with the tool force transducer and operating instructions must be supplied with the charge amplifier.

17. The charge amplifier electronics must include a means of adjusting the output signal with the specified sensitivity for each of the three output channels.

Connecting Cables:

18. All necessary electrical cables shall be supplied as part of the system such that the tool force transducer can be coupled to the charge amplifier.  Output cables from the charge amplifier to the recording instrument need not be supplied.



The Contractor shall state the warranty coverage provided for the equipment.

Please submit all questions in writing to:
andrew.perry@nist.gov

Delivery shall be FOB Destination. 
		
FOB DESTINATION MEANS: The Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.

Award will be made to the Contractor whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price.  

Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are equal in importance to 
price. If Technical Capability and Past Performance are equivalent, price shall be the determining factor.

Past Performance and price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable in accordance with the Technical Capability evaluation factor.

Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Quoters shall include the manufacturer, make and model of the product, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which CLEARLY DOCUMENTS that the offered product meets or exceeds the specifications stated herein.

SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES ARE USED IN THIS ACQUISITION AND THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION AND IS A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ).  A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The RFQ document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-18.   The associated NAICS code for this acquisition is 541330.  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires engineering services to perform a Pilot Paper Machine Upgrade Study and anticipate an award sometime in the August/September 2007 timeframe.  All interested offerors shall provide a quote for the following services: 
BACKGROUND:  Project 8500421 in the NIST Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory has operated a pilot scale Rotoformer/Cylinder (R/C) paper fabrication facility manufactured by the Sandy Hill Corporation since installation was completed in the 1970??s.   The increasing age of this machine combined with the normal attrition of the Sandy Hill machine designers and the NIST staff that were knowledgeable in operation and maintenance of such have contributed to an increasing concern for the reliability of this equipment.  This concern for the R/C machine reliability has prompted this proposed study to complete an engineering analysis of the current process equipment, controls, and performance and subsequently, to evaluate what upgrade paths are feasible to achieve various optional process goals. 
OBJECTIVES:   A detailed engineering analysis and upgrade feasibility study of the current NIST R/C paper machine with sheet width ?? 635 mm (25 in), line speed ?? 15 to 21 mm/s (35 to 50 ft/min), and operation period ?? 16 hours / week (2 days / week @ 8 hours / day). This upgrade study shall define process requirements, options, and design criteria, and identify areas in the R/C paper machine process where improvements are needed to meet future process performance requirements. This study will include an analysis of current paper quality objectives, the type of paper fiber supply, paper stock preparation, stock refiners, wet end process equipment, the various press rolls, dryers, and finishing rolls.  Initially an R/C paper machine design criteria and production analysis is to be completed. This requires the definition of the R/C machine base case using current machine data and projecting future machine performance requirements.  The resulting data will be used to establish the needed upgrade objectives to meet these requirements. Following this production analysis, a list of technical options shall be developed.  This study shall address all aspects of the current R/C machine operation with the following Feasibility Study Deliverables: Statement of Objectives; Executive Summary; Design Criteria; Process Description; Feasibility Site Work/Utilities; Feasibility General Arrangements; Paper Machine Process Balance and General Flow Diagram; Feasibility Equipment List; Discipline Scope ?C Mechanical, Structural, Controls, Electrical; Total Installed Feasibility Cost Estimate - ?? 40 %;Feasibility Schedule.
CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS AND DELIVERABLES:  The contractor shall supply to the Government the completed feasibility study printed on ??letter?? size paper with all pages assembled within a ??3-ring?? style folder or bound in a book style report.
GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES:  The Government will provide the required machine specifications or operating parameters that are specific to the NIST R/C paper machine (Sandy Hill Corp. Serial No. 124). 
INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:  The completed feasibility study will be delivered to the Government six (6) weeks after receipt of order.  Inspection and approval of the maintenance manual will be performed by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) following delivery.
The following provisions apply to this acquisition:  52.212-1 Instructions to Offertory-Commercial Items; 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items-the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Technical and past performance and experience are approximately equal when compared to price.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Past Performance-35% - the technical proposal must include three (3) specific contract references and clearly address most recent experience (both Government and non-Government), contracts, subcontracts, and grants related to the pulp and paper industry and engineering studies for requirements of similar scope and complexity.  The offeror shall include the name of the customer, including contracting agency, address, phone number, contract number, type of contract, dollar value, date of contract, period of performance, place of performance, and a brief description of the contract work scope and responsibilities; Past Experience-35%-Offerors shall include sufficient supporting data demonstrating the engineering and project management skills of the offeror??s staff.  Offeror??s expertise in the design, operation, refurbishing and maintenance of pilot scale pulp and paper processing equipment will be the focus of the evaluation for this factor;  Technical Capability-30%-Demonstration of technical capability shall be illustrated through technical descriptions, visual illustrations and a detailed explanation of the methodology to be used to produce the pilot paper machine study.  Since the deliverables of this study will be primarily written reports, the offeror??s quote should include evidence of their abilities to organize and produce detailed and clearly written technical documentation on paper processing equipment and shall discuss current or proposed facilities and equipment that will be used for the performance of the acquisition; Price-(not scored)- the price evaluation, although not scored, will determine whether the proposed price is realistic, complete and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements.  Proposed price must be entirely compatible with the technical components of the quote.  The Government reserves the right to accept an offer and make award without discussions.  52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO: Answer technical questions raised by potential bidders.

QUESTION 1: Regarding Model # ETL32x1IFL, please specify the connector type as well as the impedance.
ANSWER: L-Band with N-Type connectors and 50 ohms impedance. It does have gain so there is no loss associated with the 16:1 conversion.

QUESTION 2: Regarding L-Band Switch - Manufacturer: ATCi, Model# ETL32x1IFL, Do you want the unit 6RU or 12RU?  Connectronics and impedance?
ANSWER: The switch and controller (together) are 50 ohm, SMA connectors, 50 to 2150 MHz operating range.  All together (switch and controller) is 3U.

QUESTION 3: Regarding the Connectronics CCIFI-16N, 1:16 combiner, please specify the connector type as well as the impedance and advise if this is an active or passive combiner and what the operating frequency is.
ANSWER: 50 ohm impedance, SMA connectors, 50 to 2150 MHz operating range.  This is an active device.

QUESTION 4: Regarding the 1:16 Combiner ? Manufacturer: Connectronics, Model# CCIFI-16N, Connectronics does not recognize this P/N.  Do you have a spec or alternate model number?  Is this device passive?  Is there a power pass or 10 MHz pass needed for one of these ports?
ANSWER: Our requirement is 16:1 combiner with N-Type connector and no loss.  Small footprint is obviously preferred.

QUESTION 5: Regarding the Hub Canceller ? Manufacturer: ViaSat, Model# VA-021400-T000, Can you confirm this part number?  ViaSat does not recognize this part?  Is this a satellite modem with the PCMA technology?
ANSWER: Purchasers will have to talk directly to ViaSat reps for this.

QUESTION 6: Regarding Cables ? Manufacturer: Integrated Network Cables, Description: 80 ft of 6 ft Male to SMA Male cable, or equal, Quantity: 80 ft., can you explain the quantity?
ANSWER: This requirement is 80 6ft cables (not 80ft of cable).  These are for each of the SIMULSAT feeds (80) to connect to our switch matrix.

QUESTION 7: Regarding Cables ? Manufacturer: Integrated Network Cables, Description: 80 ft of 3 inch F type cables (1 male Y split to 2 Female), or equal, Quantity: 80 ft., can you explain the quantity?
ANSWER: This answer is the same as the previous, but these split the feeds from the SIMULSAT.  We need 80 of these cables (not 80 ft of cable).

SUBJECT:  Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor for a Country Director - Venezuela in Caracas, Venezuela

The purpose of this Amendment is to provide Attachments 1 and 2 referenced in the main solicitation.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.

OBJECTIVES

?	To create an accurate current-condition record of the existing building conditions and assist in the repair and alteration work throughout its design process. The deliverables from the interior scanning will be used primarily for (1) the documentation of existing conditions, and (2) the coordination of proposed building systems (under design) with the existing conditions as determined by (1). As-build drawings do not exist for some interstitial space for this building. The 3D imaging at this location will provide 2D CAD plans, elevations and geometric models and/or BIM required to document as-built conditions, including details of the interior spaces.  The elevations will assist architecture and engineering firms in developing their restoration and renovation designs.

?	To assist GSA in developing 3D Imaging Best Practices that will be incorporated into GSA?s BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that current and future 3D imaging yields high quality deliverables in the most efficient manner.	

Scope of Services
Imaging/Scan and Post Processing Plan

Registered Raw Data
The contractor shall submit registered raw data.  Such raw data may include point cloud data, calibrated photographs, satellite images, etc.  If 3D imaging technology is employed, the preferred format for this data is in ASCII: x, y, z, I, R, G, B (if intensity and color information are available). Other formats may be acceptable and are subject to approval by the GSA COTR. The registered point cloud data shall be reduced in size, to filter noise and redundant data to the maximum extent possible without compromising the accuracy and resolution of the model.  

2D Drawings of Existing Conditions
The contractor shall submit 2D representations of existing conditions (e.g., represent deformations and out-of-plumb conditions of artifacts that are subject to the artifact size definitions) of the areas scanned using the registered raw data.  The government shall provide current drawings and specifications for each facility structure, if available, after GSA issues the Notice to Proceed. The 3D imaging information is expected to be used for verification and modification of existing 2D CAD drawings which will be provided by the GSA to the contractor.  

3D/BIM Model of Existing Conditions
The contractor shall model the existing condition of the facilities (e.g., represent deformations and out-of-plumb conditions of artifacts that are subject to the artifact size definitions) for the architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing components listed below using either a 3D model and/or a BIM model.

Building Information Model of Proposed Design 
Contractor shall provide a BIM of the building interior and exterior based on Design Development documents and of the MEP system based on Engineering Design documents.  Proposed design documents will be provided by the GSA COTR.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Project Name:  New Bern Courthouse/Post Office/Customs House Renovation/Addition
Building Type: Courthouse
Approximate Area: 38,000 s.f.
Year Built:  1700?s (~300 years ago)
Location:  New Bern, North Carolina
Project Phase: The project is currently in Conceptual Design (CD).  CD will last approximately through October, 2007, and Design Development (DD) and Construction Documents (CD) will last through November, 2008.
Description: 
The U.S. Courthouse/Post Office/Customs House (Appendix A) is a historic structure located in New Bern, North Carolina. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building footprint is approximately 100 feet by 70 feet, and the total area is 38,000 SF. There are 3 stories (plus basement), with approximately 12 rooms per floor.

OBJECTIVES

?	To create an accurate current-condition record of the existing building conditions and assist in the repair and alteration work throughout its design process. The deliverables from the interior scanning will be used primarily for (1) the validation of existing ?as-built? data, and (2) the coordination of proposed building systems (under design) with the existing condition as validated by (1). The 3D imaging at this location will provide 2D CAD plans, elevations and 3D geometric models and/or BIM required to document as-built conditions, including details of the interior spaces.  The elevations will assist architecture and engineering firms in developing their restoration and renovation designs. 

?	To generate a point cloud of the building interior and exterior for applications such as archival, visualization, and site planning.

?	To assist GSA in developing 3D Imaging Best Practices that will be incorporated into GSA?s BIM Guide Series.  It is the intention of the government to develop the Best Practices in a collaborative way so that current and future 3D imaging yields high quality deliverables in the most efficient manner.	

SCOPE OF SERVICES
Imaging/Scan and Post Processing Plan

Registered Raw Data
The contractor shall submit registered raw data.  Such raw data may include point cloud data, calibrated photographs, satellite images, etc.  If 3D imaging technology is employed, the preferred format for this data is in ASCII: x, y, z, I, R, G, B (if intensity and color information are available). Other formats may be acceptable and are subject to approval by the GSA COTR. The registered point cloud data shall be reduced in size, to filter noise and redundant data to the maximum extent possible without compromising the accuracy and resolution of the model.  

2D Drawings of Existing Conditions
The contractor shall submit 2D representations of existing conditions (e.g., represent deformations and out-of-plumb conditions of artifacts that are subject to the artifact size definitions) of the areas scanned using the registered raw data.  The government shall provide current drawings and specifications for each facility structure, if available, after GSA issues the Notice to Proceed. The 3D imaging information is expected to be used for verification and modification of existing 2D CAD drawings which will be provided by the GSA to the contractor.  

3D/BIM Model of Existing Conditions
The contractor shall model the existing condition of the facilities (e.g., represent deformations and out-of-plumb conditions of artifacts that are subject to the artifact size definitions) for the architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing components listed below using either a 3D model and/or a BIM model.

Building Information Model of Proposed Design 
The contractor shall provide a BIM of the proposed design of the systems listed below. Contractor shall provide a BIM of the building interior and exterior based on Design Development documents and of the MEP system based on Engineering Design documents.  Proposed design documents will be provided by the GSA COTR.  

Design Coordination and Visualization Services
The contractor shall coordinate and identify any possible conflicts between existing (as-is) conditions and the proposed design solution, informing the design team of any current 2D errors or omissions.  

Quality Control Report

Site Visit
Should the offeror like to visit the site during the solicitation period, GSA may be able to facilitate the site visit.  Contact GSA contract specialist for further details.

Pre-Bid Conference 
The CO, GSA COTR, and regional teams will hold a pre-bid teleconference on 8/22/07 at 1pm EDT.  Contractors bidding on any portion of this solicitation will have the opportunity to gain clarifications on that day by calling the conference number: 888-790-6578 and using the passcode: BIM
