<DESC>Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC (BBWI), a management and operating contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office, is seeking expressions of interest from qualified companies provide macroencapsulation treatment containers.  BBWI is responsible to disposition legacy mixed low-level waste (MLLW) at the Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Project (AMWTP).  The MLLW is primarily packaged in the following containers:
Box 1:  84" L x 48" W x 48" H 
Box 2:  88" L x 54" W x 54" H 
110-gallon drum:  31" OD x 34.75" H   
Standard 55-gallon drum:  23 7/16" OD x 34.75" H  

BBWI is interested in implementing an onsite macroencapsulation treatment capability whereby these AMWTP waste packages would be placed into compliant macroencapsulation treatment containers that meet the technology description and performance standards identified in 40 CFR 268.45.   The configuration after loading would minimize void space ideally meeting the required less than 10% void space per 40 CFR 264.315(a).  Additionally, in order to minimize cost, it is imperative that the macroencapsulation container(s) be designed to efficiently configure AMWTP waste packages.  These containers must be Department of Transportation IP-2 certified.  

The forecasted MLLW volume that could potentially be dispositioned utilizing this approach is up to 13,679 cubic meters.  Approximately 40% of the MLLW will be packaged in box 1s, 40% in box 2s, 10% in 110-gallon drums, and 10% in standard 55-gallon drums.  

Containers for 1421 cubic meters of waste must be available no later than May 2008.  BBWI estimates that delivery of containers will be required on a just-in-time basis through 2014. 

Interested companies must submit capability information to the point of contact below by no later than 5 pm, Mountain Time, 03/20/2007.  Your response is limited to 15 pages.  Provide the following information: 1) Performance information for the previous three years that clearly demonstrates familiarity and experience with the anticipated work; 2) Company Quality Program description; 3) three references including summary of work, period of performance, on-time delivery performance and point of contact; and 4) conceptual design and rough order of magnitude cost estimate per container.  

BBWI will use capability information for identification of qualified companies to receive a request for proposal.  Only those companies able to demonstrate an ability to meet the requirements stated herein will receive the solicitation.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY & ASSESSEMENT Operations Planning for the FAA Office of Technology Development Financial Management, Cost-Benefit Analysis and Operational Assessment & Benefits Analysis Support  This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.1.3.12.  This is not a solicitation announcement.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Since this is an informational announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents at this time. PURPOSE:   The purpose of this market survey is to: 1) inform Industry of an upcoming procurement;  2) solicit comments on the Statement of Work; 3) assess market interest and capability of potential offerors. BACKGROUND: The Directorate of Operations Planning Technology Development Services, ATO-P  provides aviation engineering services that are an integral component of the National Airspace System (NAS) planning and operational system.  The NAS provides the flying public with air traffic control services designed to ensure air transportation safety.  ATO-P is responsible for providing technical and engineering direction and program management for multiple projects through various stages of development and NAS implementation.  ATO-P must satisfy the technical requirements of the NAS as envisioned and implemented by the FAA. The Draft Statement of work (SOW) is attached which states the contractor will support the Federal Aviation Administration's, Operational Planning & Technology Development Office, in numerous Financial Management, Cost Benefit Analysis and Performance Metrics.   Included are specific project tasks and general tasks. A Screening Information Request (SIR) is anticipating being released in late April 2007. We are considering use of a Cost Reimbursement "Cost Plus Fixed Fee" type contract.  The government estimate for this procurement is approximately $9 Million over a 5 year period.   Responses to the below Capability Statement questions are to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competitive procurement for small business. The following North American Industry Classification Codes are designated for this procurement: 541710 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences, designated small business at 500 employees or $11M ; and 541611 - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting services, designated small business at $5 M. The FAA requests the following information from interested vendors: 1. Capability Statement - Please answer the following questions: A. Has your firm provided similar type services or supported similar type programs as described in the SOW. How recently?  If so please elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance. B. Please provide additional comments regarding the SOW and any other relative comments and suggestions.  2. Discuss expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.). If respondent is an SBA 8(a) certified business, or other small business, provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent. 3. Completion of the attached Business Declaration form. And if applicable, a copy of the interested vendors 8(a) Certification Form.  This should include all necessary signatures and its expiration date. A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey does not necessitate that vendor's exclusion from the competition.  However, the failure of adequate small business participation in this market survey may result in the government determining there are not sufficient qualified small business' interested to set aside this procurement  for small business. Therefore, a full and open competition would be considered.  Interested companies can register for future announcements related to this and any procurement by Going to the FAA Website address: "http://www.asu.faa.gov/faaco/index.cfm, which is the "Contract Opportunities" site.

<DESC>Telephone Equipment and Installation for NOAA?s Beaufort Lab
EA133C-07-RQ-0180

The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Center for Coastal Fisheries and Habitat Research (CCFHR), Beaufort, NC is issuing an intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with Carolina Telephone and Telegraph Company DBA Embarq, of Greenville, NC for Telephone Parts, Cabling, and Installation.  The proposed contractor, Embarq Corporation is the present phone carrier and also has a maintenance service contract which is responsible for equipment repairs/replacement parts, etc. and our existing complex telephone equipment as well as the knowledge & expertise to maintain/service it.  The new telephone addition and installation will be tied into our present system.  The current PBX system is expanding to accommodate additional phone sets in offices of a newly constructed administration building, which is reaching completion.  Data/Voice wiring and phone capabilities for the new building were not included in the current building contract.  These capabilities are needed to meet operational requirements before occupancy of the building by CCFHR staff.  Not having these services will prevent NOAA, Beaufort Lab from meeting its operational requirements.  Expansion of the current PBX is a cost effective measure that can be completed before the new building occupancy date.  Replacing the current PBX with new equipment was considered, however it was determined to be more costly and the completion of purchase and installation not possible before the building completion date. It was determined the cost would almost triple compared to using the proposed contractor.   Purchasing, installation, and programming of expansion cards, wiring and expanded service from Embarq for our current needs can proceed in a timely manner and be completed before occupancy.  The contractor will furnish personnel, materials and equipment necessary to provide the service.  Authority:  41 USC 253(c)(1).  The NAICS Code is 517110. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1). Embarq is the only known source capable of providing the service due to the proprietary telephone equipment utilized at the Beaufort Lab.

 Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to this requirement by March 21, 2007 by 12:00 Noon.  Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.    Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Janie.M.Laferty@noaa.gov. Note 22 applies.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.  The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to procure Ring Laser Gyro Navigators (RLGN) and Ring Laser Gyrocompasses (RLG) including Technical/Test Program Support and Engineering Services under Option Year III, which will include a renegotiation of unordered but previously negotiated quantities of the Ring Laser Gyro Navigator and Ring Laser Gyrocompass systems.  The solicitation will be issued to Northrop Grumman, Sperry Marine since it is the original equipment manufacturer and sole supplier of these i!  nertial navigation systems.  It is the only company that possesses the design, data, and expertise necessary to provide the supplies within the time required to meet the Navy’s requirements.  No other source has the technical qualifications and the necessary resources to perform the work described herein and to make this effort available for full and open competition would result in unacceptable program delays and additional costs.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is soliciting offers for a contract to study the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) chemical disposition in mammals. The purpose of the project is to obtain detailed chemical disposition data from 3 to 6 studies of selected environmental contaminants or model compounds per year. Most of these studies will be required in laboratory rats (Fischer 344) and/or mice (B6C3F1); however, some studies may require other laboratory animals (other rodent species or dogs).  Most of the studies will address the disposition of organic chemicals or environmental contaminants; however, studies of inorganic chemicals may also be requested.  Individual studies may vary in complexity from preliminary investigations of chemical absorption to detailed studies of all phases of chemical disposition, toxicokinetics, and metabolism.  The immediate goal of these studies is to determine more accurately the doses for National Toxicology Program (NTP) bioassay studies.  The long range goal is the accumulation of data that will permit a better assessment of structure-activity for chemical absorption, metabolism and disposition in laboratory animals and to better interpret the significance of these data to man.  A study shall consist of the determination of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of a selected compound in a given species. Identification of unknown metabolites may be complex enough to be considered a separate study.  Estimation of toxicokinetic parameters may be requested for selected chemicals.  One or more studies per year may be requested to investigate the comparative metabolism of chemicals in human and rat liver microsomes or hepatocytes in vitro. The compounds for study shall be selected and provided by the Project Officer.  Unless a satisfactory analytical procedure is available for unlabeled compounds and both parties agree to its use, radio labeled compounds shall be provided to facilitate the assay.  In most instances, the initial studies shall be performed in male rats; however, the Project Officer shall reserve the right to require studies in female rats or additional species.  Male animals are studied initially to avoid the influence of estrogenic hormones on xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes.  The protocol for the study shall be developed by the Principal Investigator in cooperation with the Project Officer.  The government estimates that the project will require the work of 2 professional man-years and 3 technical/administrative personnel man-years in each contract year.  The Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator shall have a minimum of 5 years Post-Doctoral Degree experience.  The Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator shall demonstrate experience in specific areas by manuscripts or publications as described in the evaluation criteria.  The estimated annual level of effort is 9,980 labor hours.  Award of two cost-reimbursement, level of effort contracts (the work on the contract involves continuous activity with no clearly defined end point) on an open competition basis is contemplated as a result of this solicitation.  The contracts obtained under this solicitation will continue the work of two similar contracts.  The period of performance for the contract is five years, beginning on or about March 1, 2007 through February 28, 2012.  Five (5) one-year options extending the performance of the contract beyond the fifth base year are planned.  Should a study using dogs be initiated it will be included as an option.  Interested organizations should fax a request for RFP NIH-ES-06-01 to the attention of Mr. David Sedgley, Contract Specialist at (919) 541-2712 or send an e-mail request to sedgley@niehs.nih.gov.  Information regarding this solicitation with instructions for submission of proposals and evaluation criteria will be available on the Internet at:  http://www.niehs.nih.gov/dert/rcb/rfp.htm.  An electronic copy of the RFP (without the attachments) will be posted to this site on or about April 6, 2006.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  Expected release date of the RFP is April 6, 2006 with proposals due May 24, 2006.  This requirement is unrestricted.  NAICS Code is 541710.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), through its National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), will release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for commercially available small wind turbines to be tested at NREL’s National Wind Technology Center (NWTC).  

Background: Reducing barriers to the expansion of wind energy is an important goal for DOE’s Wind and Hydropower Technologies Program.  One of the barriers for the distributed wind market is the lack of small turbines that are independently tested and certified.  The small wind turbine community has long needed a means of distinguishing good, safe wind turbines from products that do not perform as advertised or are hazardous.  The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) have recently developed standards for testing and evaluation of small wind turbines.  NREL has developed a testing capability that is accredited by the American Association of Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) and is widely recognized as a competent testing organization.  

Objective:  The objective of the solicitation for independent testing is to provide high-quality, detailed, and independent test results for a number of small turbines and allow them the opportunity to earn a certification granted by an independent certification body, which is the process of being formed by the IREC Small Wind Certification Corporation, a non-profit organization with support from DOE, AWEA, States Energy Offices, and turbine manufacturers.

The solicitation will target commercially available turbines that have a high probability of success in the US market over the next several years.  NREL will select representative models for testing, arrange for installation of the turbine systems at the NWTC, evaluate the turbines through testing and other observations over a period of up to one year, and report its findings on the NREL web site. 

Turbine System Requirements: There are several requirements that the turbine must meet for consideration in the solicitation. These requirements include:
1.	Currently available in the US marketplace.  Converts wind energy to electricity.  Generate electricity for use on a 60 Hz AC grid or for a 12, 24, 36, or 48v battery system.  Mechanical turbines and direct connect (variable voltage) generator/motor configurations will not be accepted;
2.	Swept area of less than 200 m2;
3.	New, not refurbished;
4.	Meet NREL and National Electric Code (NEC) electrical safety requirements such as circuit protection and anti-islanding provisions; 
5.	Due to safety and access restrictions, hub height for horizontal-axis turbines not be over 100 ft and overall turbine height not over 130 feet; and, 
6.	Available for shipment and installation at the NWTC upon execution of the subcontract.

Testing Protocol: NREL will evaluate turbines based on testing protocols which are defined in detail by IEC standards and, where applicable, by the latest version of the draft AWEA standard for small wind turbines.  These tests will include duration, power performance, acoustic noise emissions, safety and function, and power quality.

If there is a major turbine failure, testing will be terminated and NREL will report results obtained, including the failure.

Solicitation Plan: NREL is planning to release an RFP in Spring 2007.  In this first phase, NREL is envisioning up to 8 awards.  The subcontract value will be dependent on the size of the turbine and the installation requirements.   NREL intends to use a firm fixed price type of subcontract.  The Subcontractor will deliver a complete turbine system to the NWTC, provide documentation, and assist with installation and maintenance. 

NREL will provide the test site and electric load, perform testing, data analysis, and reporting.

Test Reporting: Test reports will be made available to the public through posting on the NREL web site as soon as possible after test completion or turbine failure.  Participants in this project must recognize that NREL plans to report all significant results obtained, including negative results that may have a detrimental effect on future sales.  If turbine behavior is observed that is of concern to experienced wind turbine experts at NREL, NREL will make every effort to explain fully and without bias the observed behavior in its reports.  Audio and video recordings may be used for this purpose.

Selection Criteria: Selection Criteria include: 

1)	likelihood that the turbine will comprise a significant share of the U. S. small wind turbine market;
2)	total system installed cost per unit of wind intercept area;
3)	offeror’s capabilities to manufacture and supply turbines for the U.S. market, and to provide the associated installation and maintenance support; and, 
4)	programmatic factors, such as size diversity, turbine configuration diversity, technology innovation, geographic diversity, and price participation (in-kind contribution).
  
Note: The RFP will require the offeror to provide information on: projected Annual Energy Production; selling cost; turbine features; maintenance requirements; warranty; UL rating of the inverter and other components; sales history, especially in the last year; number of turbines currently installed; tower options; number of dealers/installers; manufacturing volume capacity; and, the capabilities to support the product for the life of the turbine system.  These data will be used to evaluate the above selection criteria, as well as any public domain information, such as published technical information, sales brochures, and company website information. 

Expressions of Interest: The purpose of this pre-solicitation notice is to obtain an indication of the level of interest by industry participants in the project described in the Solicitation Plan and to develop a Bidders List.  Failure to respond to this notice will not disqualify anyone from participation in the solicitation, but those that do respond to this notice are assured of receiving the RFP and notification of related activities, if they indicate that desire.  Expressions of interest should not include detailed proposals, but should include the following information: the names, addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers and email addresses of the primary contact person; a brief description of the turbine (a brochure may be provided); comments on the proposed Independent Testing project; and, a statement indicating whether or not the respondent wishes to receive a copy of the RFP. Responses to this notice should not exceed -one page; a product brochure may be attached to the response.  Responses should be received at NREL by 04/13/07.  This is not a request for proposals.  Please send responses (by mail, facsimile or email)

The background behind this EPA requirement is as follows: The EPA's National Risk Management  Research Laboratory (NRMRL), has formed a multidisciplinary Sustainable Environments Branch (SEB) within the Sustainable Technology Division (STD), with the charge of constructing a Sustainable Environments System Strategy that includes the development of environmental risk management methods. The  EPA has been testing the use of Best Management Practices (BMPs) on private parcels to mitigate the effects of excess stormwater runoff from developed areas on the hydrologic and ecological integrity of the watershed.  The contractor shall use the latest field identification references and  technology, identify the aquatic flora and fauna in freshwater stream samples, and provide this information to the EPA, following Agency sorting and processing protocol.  Based on the EPA's knowledge of technical support needed for the Statement of Work (SOW), EnviroScience, Inc. is the only known  source able to satisfy the Government's requirement.  It is critical that identification is consistent for comparison across samples from previous years (2005-06) without sacrificing data quality.  EnviroScience, Inc. has unique capabilities that are specific to the macroinvertebrate and periphyton  taxonomists conducting the identification. EnviroScience has the expertise to identify macroinvertebrate taxa to genus, plus selected taxa to species (e.g., some mayflies, midges, caddisflies, worms, and mollusks). Every taxonomist has unique capabilities allowing them to identify specific groups  to higher levels of identification than others, regardless of contract specifications (e.g., identify to lowest possible taxonomic level); thus, each taxonomist (and therefore, each contractor) provides unique capabilities allowing for consistent identification across samples. However, any firm  believing itself capable of meeting the EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete  the proposed requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable  NAICS code is 541710.  Please submit your request in writing to Scott A. Fogle at fogle.scott@epa.gov or fax your request to (513) 487-2107.  No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The price of tape drives as now deployed by GITM for this purpose is over $1700 per drive, and GITM deploys one drive for each of three servers plus a spare, at a cost of nearly $7,000 plus the cost of media.  Removable hard drives, on the other hand, consist of a carrier (around $300) and a removable drive (also roughly $300 for the same capacity as tapes).  In the recommended model of making weekly off-site backups (not daily), this reduces the cost significantly, while also greatly improving post's ability to quickly recover files and e-mails from the on-site snapshots. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Tandberg RDX Removable Hard Drive system as the only one available in the market today that meets the Department's requirements for low cost, capacity, performance, and ease of use in the backup model described in (2) above.  Per FAR 8.405-6 (e) (1), this acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s enterprise backup system.<BR><BR>CHECKING THIS BOX CERTIFIES THAT SELLER UNDERSTANDS AND IS BIDDING PER ALL SPECIFICATIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS OUTLINED IN ATTACHED DOCUMENT (1019731874Instructions.doc).

<DESC>The following is provided as updated status on the CFT source selection:

 

As a result of further reviews, it has been decided that the transition cost as originally set up in the draft RFP issued on 28 Nov 2006 will be revised.  In the formal RFP to be issued TBD, the transition cost CLIN will be removed as originally proposed.  It has been decided not to evaluate proposed transition costs for each task order on a normal basis.  The Government will reserve the right to create criteria for evaluating proposed impacts of transition costs on select task orders when in the best interest of the Government.  

It has been decided to consider increasing the target award pool on the full and open portion to 5 contracts (or however many are in the best interest of the Government).

The source selection team is scheduled to travel to Washington, D.C. on March 16 to attend an updated briefing to OSD/DPAP with the goal of resolving all outstanding issues and proceeding to final authority clearance from OSD/AT&L to issue the formal RFP.  At this point an early May 2007 release date is tentatively anticipated.

This is the most accurate information available at this time, and is subject to change.  We will keep everyone advised as things change.

<SUBJECT>A -- Studies of Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) Chemical Disposition in Mammals
<SOLNBR>NIH-ES-06-01
<RESPDATE>052406
<CONTACT>David Sedgley, Contract Specialist, Phone (919)541-4027, Fax (919)541-2712, Email sedgley@niehs.nih.gov
<DESC>The Solicitation is Ammended to replace Attachment 6 with a new Attachment 6.  The new list of Equipment and Special Facilities to be provided by the Contractor now include the following: 
A. Facilities for Animal Receipt, Housing, Treatment, and Care.
B. Facilities for safe receipt, storage, and use of toxic and radio-labeled chemicals.
C. Metabolism cages which permit humane housing of rats and mice for extended times and allow separate collection of urine, feces, exhaled volatiles and CO2.
D. Equipment for quantative chemical analysis (e.g., high performance liquid chromatogaphy (HPLC), gas liquid chromatography, UV-visible spectrometer plus the usual complement of minor laboratory eqipment).
E. Equipment for quantitative analysis of Radioactivity in chemical and biological samples (e.g., liquid scintillation counter, biological sample oxidizer, HPLC radiodetector).
F. Equipment for studies of chemical metabolism in vitro (e.g., incubator, homogenizer, centrifuges, water baths and extraction apparatus). 
G. Equipment for isolation and identification of metabolites of chemicals studied (e.g., mass spectrometers including the capability of performing liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers).
End to Ammendment 1 to RFP NIH-ES-06-01.
The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is soliciting offers for a contract to study the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) chemical disposition in mammals. The purpose of the project is to obtain detailed chemical disposition data from 3 to 6 studies of selected environmental contaminants or model compounds per year. Most of these studies will be required in laboratory rats (Fischer 344) and/or mice (B6C3F1); however, some studies may require other laboratory animals (other rodent species or dogs).  Most of the studies will address the disposition of organic chemicals or environmental contaminants; however, studies of inorganic chemicals may also be requested.  Individual studies may vary in complexity from preliminary investigations of chemical absorption to detailed studies of all phases of chemical disposition, toxicokinetics, and metabolism.  The immediate goal of these studies is to determine more accurately the doses for National Toxicology Program (NTP) bioassay studies.  The long range goal is the accumulation of data that will permit a better assessment of structure-activity for chemical absorption, metabolism and disposition in laboratory animals and to better interpret the significance of these data to man.  A study shall consist of the determination of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of a selected compound in a given species. Identification of unknown metabolites may be complex enough to be considered a separate study.  Estimation of toxicokinetic parameters may be requested for selected chemicals.  One or more studies per year may be requested to investigate the comparative metabolism of chemicals in human and rat liver microsomes or hepatocytes in vitro. The compounds for study shall be selected and provided by the Project Officer.  Unless a satisfactory analytical procedure is available for unlabeled compounds and both parties agree to its use, radio labeled compounds shall be provided to facilitate the assay.  In most instances, the initial studies shall be performed in male rats; however, the Project Officer shall reserve the right to require studies in female rats or additional species.  Male animals are studied initially to avoid the influence of estrogenic hormones on xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes.  The protocol for the study shall be developed by the Principal Investigator in cooperation with the Project Officer.  The government estimates that the project will require the work of 2 professional man-years and 3 technical/administrative personnel man-years in each contract year.  The Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator shall have a minimum of 5 years Post-Doctoral Degree experience.  The Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator shall demonstrate experience in specific areas by manuscripts or publications as described in the evaluation criteria.  The estimated annual level of effort is 9,980 labor hours.  Award of two cost-reimbursement, level of effort contracts (the work on the contract involves continuous activity with no clearly defined end point) on an open competition basis is contemplated as a result of this solicitation.  The contracts obtained under this solicitation will continue the work of two similar contracts.  The period of performance for the contract is five years, beginning on or about March 1, 2007 through February 28, 2012.  Five (5) one-year options extending the performance of the contract beyond the fifth base year are planned.  Should a study using dogs be initiated it will be included as an option.  Interested organizations should fax a request for RFP NIH-ES-06-01 to the attention of Mr. David Sedgley, Contract Specialist at (919) 541-2712 or send an e-mail request to sedgley@niehs.nih.gov.  Information regarding this solicitation with instructions for submission of proposals and evaluation criteria will be available on the Internet at:  http://www.niehs.nih.gov/dert/rcb/rfp.htm.  An electronic copy of the RFP (without the attachments) will be posted to this site on or about April 6, 2006.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  Expected release date of the RFP is April 6, 2006 with proposals due May 24, 2006.  This requirement is unrestricted.  NAICS Code is 541710.

Review Part D Plan Formularies and Benefits 

INTRODUCTION

This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis in support of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Center for Beneficiary Choices (CBC).  CMS is seeking capability statements from small and minority business firms (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that are qualified to support CMS in reviewing plan formularies and benefits related to the Medicare prescription drug program. This initiative will assist CMS in achieving its objective of reviewing plan formularies and benefits to ensure compliance with the guidelines outlined in the CMS Strategy for Reviewing Prescription Drug Plan Formularies and Procedures for Affordable Access to Needed Drugs Covered under MMA: Guidelines for Reviewing Prescription Drug Plan Formularies and Procedures (referred to as Formulary Guidelines), available at: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PrescriptionDrugCovContra/03_RxContracting_FormularyGuidance.asp#TopOfPage and to ensure compliance with CMS’ benefit guidelines.
 

HISTORY

In January 2005 the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued the final rule on the Medicare prescription drug benefit.  This new voluntary prescription drug benefit program was enacted into law on December 8, 2003, in Section 101 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization act of 2003 (MMA). The addition of a prescription drug benefit to Medicare represents a landmark change to the Medicare program that will significantly improve the health care coverage available to millions of Medicare beneficiaries.  The MMA specified that the prescription drug benefit program would be available to beneficiaries beginning on January 1, 2006.  The drug benefit is offered to Medicare beneficiaries through Medicare Advantage drug plans (MA-PDs), stand-alone prescription drug plans (PDPs), or fallback plans.

The MMA requires CMS to review Prescription Drug Plans formularies to ensure beneficiaries have access to a broad range of medically appropriate drugs to treat all disease states and the formulary’s design does not discriminate or substantially discourage enrollment of certain groups of beneficiaries.  The primary focus of the formulary review is to ensure the inclusion of a broad distribution of therapeutic categories and classes, utilize reasonable benchmarks to check that drug lists are non-discriminatory, review tiering and utilization management strategies, identify potential outliers at each review step for further CMS investigation, and obtain clinical justification when outliers are determined to be potentially discriminatory. 

The MMA requires CMS to review Prescription Drug Plans benefit packages to ensure nondiscriminatory benefit designs.  In addition CMS reviews the benefit packages to ensure there are no discrepancies between the plans formulary and benefit submissions. 

TASK DESCRIPTION

Formulary Review

Under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) (formerly known as the SIC code): 541611 – (Size Standard: $6.5 million. Additional information on NAICS codes can be found at www.sba.gov), the Contractor shall review plan formularies to ensure they meet the standards outlined in the CMS formulary guidance documents. All reviews must be done by licensed pharmacists.  The pharmacist reviewers will utilize reports generated by Health Plan Management System (HPMS) to review plan formularies against CMS’ standards. This review will consist of reports that contain “potential issues” listed for the pharmacist to review for discrimination, access or clinical issues.  The review will include, but is not limited to, the following areas:  

•	Discrimination Review.  Formularies will be reviewed for inclusion of drugs to check for formulary robustness and breadth of covered drugs.
•	 Formulary Classification Review.  The categories and classes will be reviewed for all submitted formularies.  Additionally, all formularies will be reviewed to ensure inclusion of at least two drugs in each of the plans’ categories and classes.  
•	Common Medicare Drugs Review.  Formularies will be reviewed to ensure inclusion of those drugs or drug classes that are most commonly utilized by the Medicare population.  
•	Drug Classes of Clinical Concern.  Submitted formularies must be reviewed to ensure coverage of all or substantially all drugs in recognized classes of special clinical concern.
•	Treatment Guideline Review.  Drugs or drug classes specifically identified in widely accepted treatment guidelines will be identified.  Formulary submissions will be reviewed for these drugs or drug classes.
•	Tier Placement Review.  A tier review will be performed for all Part D formulary submissions to ensure adequate coverage of drug classes in preferred formulary tiers.
•	Utilization Management Review.  Applicable utilization management tools will be reviewed for clinical appropriateness, as well as to ensure that there are no discriminatory practices.

In addition to the identification of potential formulary issues, the review will require the coordination and completion of following processes: 

•	Communication of potential formulary issues identified during the initial formulary review.
•	Review of plan-submitted clinical justifications in response to outlier communication.
•	Participation in formulary negotiations with plan sponsors
•	Secondary formulary reviews.
•	Review of monthly formulary updates.
•	Tests and analyses to assure review consistency (e.g., 95% of the materials reviewed by a second reviewer result in the same finding as for the original review).
•	The estimated number of formularies to be reviewed is 600 initial formulary submissions and 450 monthly updates.

Benefit Review

The Contractor shall review the cost sharing structure for each formulary tier to ensure plans do not have a benefit structure that is discriminatory. The analyst will utilize data generated by HPMS to review cost sharing per tier against the standards set forth by CMS. This review will consist of data analysis that focuses on “outliers” to review for potential discrimination.  The review will require the coordination and completion of the following processes:

•	Maintain a spreadsheet of the outcomes of the benefits review.
•	Participate in benefit negotiations with plan sponsors
•	Secondary benefit review
•	Tests and analyses to assure review consistency (e.g., 95% of the materials reviewed by a second reviewer result in the same finding as for the original review).
•	The estimated number of plan benefit packages to be reviewed is 2500.

<DESC>Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement Potential Sources Sought 

Potential Sources Sought. This is not a RFP. 
  
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for an anticipated award to advance the knowledge and use of continuously reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP).  The effort requires development of a national communications plan to develop a shared sense of purpose among all of FHWA’s partners and customers in the States and throughout the industry group associated with concrete pavement design, construction, repair, and rehabilitation.  

This focused technology transfer, and the acceptance and implementation of guidance for design and engineering that follows, must be structured for continuous feedback in order to gain the support of decision-makers in multiple sectors including State DOTs, the professional design community, and the concrete pavement industry. This effort will result in a strategic approach to communicate with national audiences on this proven approach to pavement design, construction, and rehabilitation and will encourage timely acceptance and technically sound implementation of CRCP as an alternate pavement system. 

The advancement of CRCP through technology transfer and delivery of industry guidance for design and engineering consists of two distinct yet related parts: 

Part A:  Strategy for technology transfer of guidance for design and engineering of CRCP to State DOTs, and to pavement engineering and industry communities – The effort will require the organizing and coordinating of program activities among the agency/owner and industry communities through the use of periodic in-person meetings, conference calls, listserv and mailing lists, workshops, seminars, conferences; and, through the preparation and distribution of printed and electronic documents including, but not limited to, informational flyers, technical briefs, videos and technical reports.  

Part B:  Strategy for assisting State DOTs in the process of acceptance, modification as needed, and implementation of industry guidance for design and engineering of CRCP – The effort will require the organizing and coordinating of program activities among State DOTs and industry communities through the use of working groups.  FHWA anticipates that an Expert Task Group (ETG) subject to Government review.  The ETG will have a key roll in providing guidance for this process.  One or more members of the ETG can come from each of the sectors identified as follows: industry organizations, paving contractors, concrete and material suppliers, engineering and architectural firms, research organizations, academia, state highway agencies and FHWA offices.  The ideal number of ETG members may vary from time to time; however, a range of ten to fifteen members would be a reasonable target for use in organizing the ETG.

The FHWA Office of Pavement Technology has an ongoing concrete pavement technology program to develop and transfer new technologies related to improved concrete pavement performance.  The advancement of CRCP through technology transfer and delivery of industry guidance for design and engineering is within the broad scope of that program; however, new and complementary efforts are needed to create national awareness, acceptance and implementation of this proven CRCP technology. This effort needs to be focused not only on State DOTs but also on the entire concrete pavement industry, including engineers, architects, concrete producers, material suppliers and pavement contractors, in order for the established industry guidance for design and engineering to be accepted and used by all parties. 

The awardee selected will be expected to have capabilities in:

Technical and engineering – Capabilities to fully understand the technical aspects of CRCP and to convey that knowledge to other parties including but not limited to engineers, contractors and agency/owners of roadways. The delivery of industry guidance for design and engineering of CRCP will be the major focus of this effort. Technical and engineering staff members should be conversant in current and relevant topics concerning best practices for concrete materials and concrete production, and best practices for concrete pavement design, construction, repair, and rehabilitation.  

Communications and marketing – Capabilities to develop, maintain and utilize a variety contact lists such as listserv and mailing lists.  Timely transfer of information, including feedback from other parties including but not limited to engineers, contractors and agency/owners of roadways will be critical to the delivery of CRCP guidelines. Other capabilities that would be considered useful include editorial and document production services.

Project management and reporting – Capabilities to perform and/or direct the efforts of technical, engineering, communications, and marketing staff. Timely and cost-effective performance in each of these areas is required. 

The estimated period of performance for the project is five years.  FHWA anticipates a level of effort ranging from 2 to 4 professional and technical staff members per year for the duration of the project.  

Note: The level of activity will greatly depend on continued and additional funding under the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) to FHWA. 

RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE: Any interested organizations are invited to submit a Capability Statement by March 26, 2007, by e-mail to Katasha.White@DOT.gov, or in writing to Federal Highway Administration, Office of Acquisition Management, Attn: Ms. Katasha G. White, HAAM 40F, Room 4410, 400 7th Street, SW, Washington DC, 20590.     

Capability Statements shall clearly identify the following items regarding the interested organization(s): (1) name and address of prospective organization(s); (2) technical capabilities to perform the work; (3) relevant experience and credentials; (4) synopsis of experience and expertise of potential staff; (5) relevant projects completed related to the anticipated objectives of the project with information on the client, scope, and products; and (6) a description of available facilities to perform the work outlined above.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. This is not a request for quotes (RFQ), invitation for bid (IFB), request for proposal (RFP), request for application (RFA) or an announcement of a solicitation and does not assume the government will award a contract or proceed with any of the above solicitations in the near future. This notice is for market research purposes only. 

Federal Occupational Health Service (FOHS) provides comprehensive occupational health (OH) services to federal agencies throughout the federal government. The FOHS mission is to improve the health and safety of the government workforce by designing and providing innovative, customized, cost-effective occupational health, environmental and work/life solutions that exceed customer expectations. In keeping with this mission, the Clinical Division of FOHS provides a full range of health fair services. On occasion FOHS needs assistance from a contractor when coordinating larger health fairs. This assistance would include: attending meetings with agency prior to fair to determine specific needs; arranging on behalf of agency any specific permits necessary for fair; assisting with exhibit set up on the day of the fair; meetings with agency after fair. In addition to these services, the contractor may be asked to bring in vendors to perform screenings for bone density, glucose, cholesterol, and other wellness laboratory tests. Currently, the health fairs are only in the Washington, D.C. Metro region, but may extend to other surrounding states. 

Contractor would not be responsible for the procurement of tents, tables, or generators for health fairs; this will be the responsibility of the sponsoring agency.  However, contractor would need to make recommendations to the agency as to quantity of these items needed for the fair well in advance, no less than 90 days prior to date of fair.

Some health fairs may require special clearances or permits, which could include road closures.  Contractor will need to be well versed in this process and be able to attend necessary meetings to accomplish this task on behalf of the sponsoring agency.

FORMAT OF INFORMATION REQUESTED

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE; there is no solicitation available at this time.  No response will be provided to requests for a solicitation.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) seeks potential sources for the development of nuclear radiation detectors that use Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) as the detection medium for gamma-ray spectroscopy.  It is desired that an existing CZT production capability has been demonstrated through prior sales.

In the short term, DTRA seeks to advance the production capability for CZT towards large, single crystals at a minimum size 10 cubic centimeters with gamma spectral resolution of 1% or better at 663 keV.  A measurable response to gamma rays up to 3 MeV is highly desired.  The long-term DTRA goal is single CZT crystals of at least 100 cubic centimeters with similar spectral resolution.  In order to make progress towards this goal, it is desired that a vendor have excess CZT production capacity that could be devoted to research and development on modified production processes.

Sources sought responses shall reflect corporate information and a capability summary reflecting experience related to the above area.  Responses are to be limited to no more than five pages.

<CONTACT>George Odorizzi, Contract Specialist, Phone 847-688-2600x415, Fax 847-688-6567, Email george.odorizzi@navy.mil
<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS ISSUED AS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY and while a solicitation does not presently exist, a solicitation will likely be crafted based, in part, upon responses to this notice.

NAVFAC Midwest is currently seeking potential sources for a performance based preventive maintenance and emergency troubleshooting & repair service program for the existing base central steam plant digital boiler control systems.  This is not a request for proposal and no solicitation is available at this time.  A market research survey is being conducted to determine interest and capability of potential sources from any 8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, and/or general Small Business offerors.  All interested parties are invited to respond by registering and submitting a statement of capabilities (as described later in this announcement).  

The Central Steam Plant Boiler Control System is comprised of a network of devices including servers, client work station computers, programmable logic controllers, input/output modules, switches, etc, all operating and communicating in an integrated manner using a variety of different software programs/packages that control and facilitate various network processes/applications, such as communications, process control, operator system interface, data storage, etc.  A majority of the applications used by this system were developed by Rockwell Automation and all controller programs are written using Rockwell Automation software, which serves as the backbone upon which the entire control system is built.  Plant operators monitor and control the boilers and other equipment using networked clients/workstations which access process data constantly being collected by system control devices, using a graphical interface operating on the network servers.  The majority of system control equipment is manufactured by Allen Bradley.      

The scope of the anticipated service contract includes a variety of maintenance duties in support of the Central Steam Plant Boiler Control System including routine/periodic preventive maintenance, as well as emergency system troubleshooting and repair.  Routine/preventive maintenance tasks will include system backups, software revision upgrades/installations, checking various network equipment functions/status indicators, etc.  Emergency system troubleshooting and repair tasks will include addressing network equipment and/or control system software program failures or inadequate performance.  These tasks would be performed at varying times, including normal working hours, after hours, on weekends and holidays.  In essence, a Control Engineer with intimate and complete system knowledge must be available to respond to emergencies 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, due to the critical nature of the processes/equipment being controlled by the system.  

An additional category of tasks required under the anticipated service contract includes various control system modification and add-on projects that may be developed during the contract period.  These projects might include control programming modifications or additional logic in support of new or modified control equipment/strategies and may also require the purchase, installation and programming of new control system devices. 

If issued, the request for proposal (RFP) will likely be a combination of Firm Fixed Price/Indefinite Quantity Performance-Based Contract, using Best Value Source Selection Procedures.  In addition, if issued, the RFP will likely include a base period award for a period of up to one year with up to four (4) option periods (years).  Exercise of each option period would depend on contractor performance and whether the requirement continues to exist.  The total duration, including exercise of any options, would not likely exceed sixty (60) months.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334513 for which the small business size standard is 500 employees.

<CONTACT>Darrick Early, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-205-5668, Fax 202-690-7412, Email darrick.early@hhs.gov
<DESC>*** BACKGROUND *** The National Pandemic Plan of 2005 designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response for pandemic preparedness and response. Following the issuance of the HHS Pandemic Plan of 2005, the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP) was made responsible for the advanced development, establishment of surge capacity, and acquisition of medical countermeasures such as vaccines and antiviral drugs that may be used to contain, control, and mitigate the mortality and morbidity associated with influenza pandemics in the U.S. The tactical and logistical implementation of policies and decisions regarding these pandemic medical countermeasures is the responsibility of the Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OPHEP. ***DESCRIPTION*** This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned. HHS/OPHEP/ORDC has an interest in identifying potential prophylactic / therapeutic agents likely to be effective in preventing or reducing influenza virus infection. The appropriate use of these antiviral agents during an influenza seasonal or pandemic outbreaks may delay or contain influenza infections in local communities, may reduce the morbidity and mortality, and may mitigate the overwhelming load that will be placed on the healthcare system.

Currently there are two main classes of FDA-licensed antiviral drugs that interfere with the influenza virus infection: adamantanes which act as M2 ion channel blockers (amantidine and rimantidine) and viral neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir and oseltamivir phosphate). The U.S. Government has an interest in identifying sources of new antiviral drugs and compounds which could be used potentially during circulation of influenza viruses in a community for treatment or prevention of infection during epidemic or pandemic events. Potential antiviral drugs of interest include neuraminidase inhibitors, inhibitors of hemagglutinin-mediated functions, drugs that block influenza receptor binding, inhibitors of influenza virus fusion, influenza virus RNA polymerase inhibitors, new inhibitors of M2 ion channel activity, snRNAi, polyclonal/monoclonal antibody cocktails, other viral replication inhibitory compounds and other drugs sharing anti-influenza effects. Of particular interest are those antiviral agents that are in clinical development for prevention and/or treatment of influenza infections and that may exhibit longer or greater product shelf-life, efficacy, bioavailability, half-life, and pharmacokinetics for treatment after influenza infection or post exposure. Additionally, of interest are those agents that can be delivered both orally (or by other needleless technology) and parenterally, depending upon the clinical status of the recipient.
   
Interested organizations that have potential candidate drugs or compounds are invited to submit a statement of capability, product description, and development status to HHS/OPHEP/ORDC. Specifically, submitted information depending upon the stage of product development provide  the following: (1) a description of the potential antiviral drug including chemical structure, physical chemical characteristics and biological activity; (2) a description of the method of synthesis, isolation or purification and potency assays; (3) a description of the mechanism of action; (4) a description of the proposed production process; (5) a description of the proposed preclinical or clinical studies; (6) a description of the proposed formulation, dosage and route of administration; (7) regulatory pathway, limitations, and possible obstacles; (8) an estimate of production capacity, manufacturing sites, and timelines and estimated retail costs; and (9) intellectual property accessibility. 

Data obtained from this RFI will be used by HHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy for National Pandemic Preparedness. All information submitted to HHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. 
Information must be submitted by 3:00 pm, February 13, 2006. Responses should be limited to 50 pages in an electronic and hard copy formats and can be e-mailed to the attention of Darrick A. Early, Contract Specialist, phone 202-205-5668, email darrick.early@hhs.gov.  Please ensure that at least one electronic and TWO (2) HARD COPIES of all responses are submitted.

It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned. HHS/OPHEP/ORDC has an interest in identifying potential influenza vaccine manufacturers capable of providing expanded domestic pandemic influenza vaccine capacity using egg-based vaccine products. Additionally, there is further interest in identifying potential influenza vaccine manufacturers with active pandemic influenza vaccine programs using recombinant-based approaches and committed to U.S.-based manufacturing and licensure.

The current domestic influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity is approximately 180 million doses at 15 ug HA per dose in nine (9) months using inactivated, egg-based vaccines. In order to achieve a goal of 600 million monovalent pandemic influenza vaccines doses manufactured in six (6) months, significant increases in surge capacity must be afforded by expanding existing egg-based influenza vaccine manufacturing facilities, erecting new influenza vaccine manufacturing facilities utilizing egg-based technologies as available and converting existing manufacturing facilities that produce FDA-licensed vaccines and biologics to influenza vaccines. Further to this end, advanced development of recombinant-based influenza vaccines towards U.S.-based manufacturing and licensure needs to accompany the HHS support of advanced development of cell-based influenza vaccines.  

Interested organizations that have potential candidate facilities, plans for facilities, or vaccine candidates are invited to submit a statement of capability, facility or product description, and development status to HHS/OPHEP/ORDC.
Specifically, submitted information depending upon the stage of facility should provide  the following: (1) U.S. facility location and description (i.e. sq. ft., systems, equipment, etc.); (2) a description of the facility’s potential pandemic influenza vaccine product yield and capacity (i.e. number of monovalent doses in six months following receipt of pandemic virus isolate or nucleotide sequence); (3) a description of the vaccine manufacturing process and biocontainment capability including waste products; and (4) a description of milestones, timelines, and cost estimates for the design, renovation (if applicable), construction, commissioning, and validation of the facility to address the urgency of a possible pandemic in the near future. 

Similarly, submitted information depending on the stage of recombinant influenza vaccine development should provide the following: (1) a description of the recombinant vaccine product and comparability to existing influenza vaccines; (2) description of the manufacturing process and lot release product assays; (3) results of preclinical and/or clinical studies; (4) a description of the proposed formulation, dosage and route of administration; (5) regulatory pathway, limitations, and possible obstacles; (6) an estimate of production capacity, U.S. manufacturing sites, and timelines and estimated retail costs; and (7) intellectual property accessibility. Data obtained from this RFI will be used by HHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy for National Pandemic Preparedness. All information submitted to HHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. 

A pre-solicitation meeting of interested companies will be scheduled at 10:30am to 12:00pm EST on February 7, 2006 in the Humphrey Building of the HHS located at 200 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, D.C. 20201. Information from the meeting will be posted on the website www.Fedbizopps.gov. Advance registration is required to attend the meeting. There is a limit of two attendees per organization. Email name of attendee, organization name, and telephone number to darrick.early@hhs.gov.

Information must be submitted by 3:00 PM, EST, February 21, 2006. Responses to the facility or recombinant product requests should be limited to 25 pages in an electronic and hard copy formats and can be e-mailed to the attention of Darrick (Andre) Early, Contract Specialist, phone 202-205-5668, email address: darrick.early@hhs.gov. If information is sent by courier or mail service, please ensure that at least one electronic and TWO (2) HARD COPIES of all responses are submitted.

<SUBJECT>R -- Creation of Final Analysis Data Sets
<DESC>In accordance with FAR subpart 13.106(b) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Jose Luis Carlosama, in the amount of $40,500 for the Creation of Final Analysis Data Sets and Electronic Files for Reproductive Health Survey Data and Reports. This project also involves the creation of complete sets of data files and documentation standard format for twelve Eastern European surveys. It also requires archiving and distributing survey data and final reports more efficiently and economically and makes data and reports available through web application involving 24 published reports, creating PDF files from scanned documents and introducing electronic bookmarks so the reader can navigate through the document by chapter.  CDC believes that Jose Luis Carlosama is the only individual that can meet the requirements of the order because He has demonstrated experience in managing and producing electronic files, including scanning and preparing PDF files. Mr. Carlosama is a skilled SAS programmer and has experience in creation of data sets for survey data.  His educational and professional experience with the Center for the Study of Population and Social Development indicates his understanding of the survey process and materials developed from Reproductive Health surveys. Mr. Carlosama ability to speak Spanish is a pre-requisite for completing the work, given that 60% of the reports to be scanned and developed are in the Spanish language. His academic training in informatics and computer science provides a solid foundation for providing technical support in the required activities. Mr. Carlosama?s Spanish-language capabilities and his ability to program in SAS and clear understanding of how survey data sets are arranged, organized, and documented are unique skills.   Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to provide this service described above should submit a capabilities statement demonstrating their abilities to provide the service. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.

Documentation should be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by CDC. A determination by the CDC not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within discretion on of the government.

<SUBJECT>A--LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER OUTREACH IMAGING PRODUCTS
<DESC>NASA will be flying the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) in late 2008.	This mission is scheduled for a 50 km lunar polar orbit with a nominal 1 year life.	Its primary mission will be to obtain critical orbital data on the properties and environment of the Moon.  Given the current resource picture, there will be an opportunity to fly additional cameras (under 5 kilograms with a spacewire interface per European Space Agency specification) on this orbiter for education and public outreach purposes.  If this occurs, it would provide opportunities for on-board video and/or still photos to be taken that capture images of the spacecraft, the Moon, and/or the Earth.  It is anticipated that up to 10 minutes of video at a time may be obtained for later downlink.  The frame rate is variable up to approximately 30 frames per second.  The field of view will include portions of the LRO spacecraft such as solar panels and the high gain antenna, and depending on spacecraft orientation, the Earth and/or the Moon.  The Lunar Precursor Robotic Program (LPRP) Office is requesting concepts for innovative commercial methods for making these images available to the public at no or low cost.  As part of this Request for Information (RFI), recommendations are also sought for the content of images to be captured, as well as details about how this imagery could be used to enhance public recognition of NASA’s Vision for Space Exploration. Any information obtained as a result of this RFI is intended to be used by the Government on a non-attribution basis for program planning and acquisition strategy development. By submitting information in response to this RFI submitters of such information imply consent to the release and dissemination of the information to any Government or non-Government entity to which NASA releases and disseminates the information for review. Review of the submitted information may be performed by multi-disciplined review teams. Moreover, review teams may include third parties, such as contractor personnel who support NASA. As such, to the extent that any information submitted in response to this RFI is marked as or construed to be proprietary or business-sensitive, submitters are hereby notified (a) about the potentiality that such information may be disclosed to third parties and (b) that submission of information in response to this RFI constitutes consent to such handling and disclosure of submitted information. This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only and the Government does not presently intend to award a contract at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is subject to FAR 52.215-3.  Responses to this RFI should be provided on or before March 30, 2007.  Responses should be addressed to Mark E. Nall at VP41, Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. An Offeror may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction.

Offerors may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means.

SHIPPING DOCUMENTS WILL CELARLY LIST EACH ITEM AND THE QUANTITY SHIPPED AS CONTAINED WITHIN BOXES OR CONTAINERS. IF SINGLE LINE ITEMS HAVE BEEN ASSEMBLED INTO MAJOR COMPONENT, SHIPPING DOCUMENTS MUST ACCOUNT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL ITEMS SHIPPED WITHIN THE MAJOR COMPONENT.<BR><BR>New equipment ONLY, NO remanufactured products<BR><BR>FOB DESTINATION CONUS<BR><BR>*The Vendor may not substitute any item listed on this order without prior written approval by the Contracting Officer. *No other individual is authorized, either verbally or in writing to change part numbers, manufacturers, quantities, delivery dates or any other specification of this award. *Items that do not conform to descriptions and part numbers found in Block 17 will be rejected at the time of delivery causing a return at the Vendors expense. *Items received must adhere to the configuration as submitted and approved by the PMA Lab. *Vendors must deliver to the configuration as tested and approved. *Items not in compliance will be returned to the Vendor at no additional cost to the Government and comments will be noted to Vendor Performance. *Random Quality Assurance will be conducted to ensure Vendor/Manufacturer conformance.<BR><BR>The Department is moving in the direction of using frequent, local, disk-based snapshots for quick recovery of lost or damaged files or e-mails, which will reduce the need for off-site transport of backups for disaster recovery purposes (as required in 12 FAM 622.3). The price of tape drives as now deployed by GITM for this purpose is over $1700 per drive, and GITM deploys one drive for each of three servers plus a spare, at a cost of nearly $7,000 plus the cost of media. Removable hard drives, on the other hand, consist of a carrier (around $300) and a removable drive (also roughly $300 for the same capacity as tapes). In the recommended model of making weekly off-site backups (not daily), this reduces the cost significantly, while also greatly improving post's ability to quickly recover files and e-mails from the on-site snapshots. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Tandberg RDX Removable Hard Drive system as the only one available in the market today that meets the Department's requirements for low cost, capacity, performance, and ease of use in the backup model described in (2) above. Per FAR 8.405-6 (e) (1), this acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor¿s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department¿s requirements as a key component of the Department¿s enterprise backup system.<BR><BR>CHECKING THIS BOX CERTIFIES THAT SELLER UNDERSTANDS AND IS BIDDING PER ALL SPECIFICATIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS OUTLINED IN ATTACHED DOCUMENT (1019731874Instructions.doc). No exceptions. If you cannot agree to ALL terms and instructions, do not bid.<BR><BR>ENTIRE QUANTITIES OF ALL LINE ITEMS MUST BE DELIVERED BY CLOSE OF BUSINESS MARCH 29 2007, IF YOU CAN NOT MEET THIS DELIVERY DO NOT QUOTE.<BR><BR>

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for real-time sign language interpreter services in support of deaf/hearing impaired Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) employees in the conduct of their official duties. The ability to call upon interpreter services on a real-time basis requires the availability of on site interpreter services Monday through Friday during the core hours of 8:30 AM through 5:00 PM. The interpreter will effectively be on demand during these core hours to provide services at FHWA wherever needed. The services of a second interpreter will be required Tuesday through Thursday during the core hours of 9:30 AM through 3:30 PM. In addition, there may be events and activities outside of core hours or events and activities scheduled concurrently during core hours that require interpreter services.

The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 05-15. This procurement is a total small business set-aside. See Note 1. The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 541930 and $6.5 million respectively. The offeror shall state in their offer its size status for this procurement.     All responsible small business sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the agency. Offers for the services described above are due by March 26, 2007, 4:00 PM local time to Federal Highway Administration, Office of Acquisition Management, Room 4410, 400 7th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590, and must include, solicitation number, discount/payment terms, taxpayer identification number (TIN) and be signed by an authorized company representative. 

Offerors shall provide the information required by FAR 52.212-1 (SEP 2006), Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, which is incorporated by reference. FAR 52.212-4 (FEB 2007), Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items with its Alternate 1 is applicable.  FAR 52.212-5 (NOV 2006), Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items is applicable and the applicable clauses are incorporated in the attached RFP. The FAR may be obtained via the Internet at URL: http://www.acquisition.gov/far/index.html. The clauses and provisions cited herein may be found at http://acquisition.gov/far/current/html/52_212_213.html. 

All contractual and/or technical questions must be in writing (email only) to Bob Prior at bob.prior@dot.gov not later than March 21st at 11:00 AM local time. Telephone questions will not be accepted. The Government plans to use the tradeoff process described in FAR 15.101-1 in the evaluation of proposals. This process allows the Government to consider award to other than the lowest price offeror when, in its judgment, a higher priced proposal provides benefits that merit the additional cost. The fact that a higher cost proposal is rated higher than lower cost proposals does not necessarily justify award. The benefits of a higher rated, higher cost proposal must be judged to be sufficient to warrant the higher cost and the amount of the higher cost must be judged to be both reasonable and worth the benefits. The Government will make an award to the offeror representing the best value to the Government. The following relative weights will be used when assessing proposals: The Technical Capabilities (includes interpreter experience, understanding, management plan and administrative responsibility) 50%; Past Performance 20% Oral Presentation 30%.  All technical factors, when combined are more important than price. Offerors must include completed copies of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (NOV 2006) with their offer. These representations and certifications will be incorporated by reference in any resultant contract.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, F2A3E27030A100, is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This acquisition is set aside for small business only.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-02. The NAICS code is 541620 and the small business size standard is $6.5 Million dollars.  The following commercial items are requested in this solicitation: Line Item 0001: Conduct LBP Inspections and Risk Assessments in MFH being transferred to Operation Walking Shield.

STATEMENT OF WORK
LEAD BASED PAINT
INSPECTIONS AND RISK ASSESSMENTS
FOR TRANSFERRED HOUSING UNITS

The Contractor shall conduct a risk assessment and lead-based paint inspection of the following residential housing units (34 total) in accordance with 40 CFR 745.227 and all applicable North Dakota Department of Health Regulations (NDAC 33-15-24) and guidelines (NDLBP001):

Side-by-side duplexes:

1203A and 1203B March Drive
1205A and 1205B March Drive
1207A and 1207B March Drive
1208A and 1208B March Drive
1220A and 1220B March Drive
1222A and 1222B March Drive
1224A and 1224B March Drive
1226A and 1226B March Drive
1512A and 1512B March Drive
1513A and 1513B March Drive
1514A and 1514B March Drive
1516A and 1516B March Drive
1517A and 1517B March Drive
1518A and 1518B March Drive
1519A and 1519B March Drive
1218A and 1218B Cedar Avenue

Single family units:

1228 March Drive
1520 March Drive

All housing units are located at Grand Forks Air Force Base; Coordinate with Mr. Kevin Flickinger, 319 CES/CEH (701-747-4473), for scheduling and access to the housing units.

THE FINAL BID SUBMISSION DATE HAS CHANGED TO 19 MAR 2007 @ 1600HRS

All requests for additional information and questions regarding the SOW must be directed to 319 CONS, A1C Michael J. Haack at 701-747-5294.  The successful Contractor will then contact Mr. Kevin Flickinger for access to the units to perform the inspections and risk assessments.

Answers to proposed questions:

1.  What is the approximate age of the housing?  The housing units were built in 1962.

2.  Regarding scheduling.  Would the housing be available consecutive days?  Thus allowing for us to perform the assessments  one building after another until complete. OR will we need to coordinate in as a phased approach, as the buildings are not readily accessible?  There are currently 27 units empty and 7 units still occupied.  The base will require that the 27 vacant units  be inspected and assessed when the weather permits (snow is gone and yards dry enough for soil sampling, perhaps late May or early June).  The remaining 7 units will be available no later than sometime in September 2007.  If the occupied units are vacated prior to September 2007, 319 CONS will contact the successful Contractor for earlier completion of the field work.

3.  Is there a template or order you prefer the information presented, regarding the assessment report?  There is no particular template or order that the base prefers.  However, the format and order must be consistent for each report.

1) By definition, a risk assessment does include soil samples.  The federal HUD regulation (24 CFR Part 35 Subpart C) does not address the situation where a housing unit is actually relocated to a new property.  Therefore, soil samples are still required.

2) The collection of paint chip samples will have to be determined by the contractor based on his/her professional knowledge and experience.


There are four floor plans associated with the units requiring LBP inspections and risk assessments: 
1.	MC3-2 (Units1205, 1208, 1220, 1224, 1226, 1513, 1514, 1517, 1518, 1519, and 1218);
2.	MC4-2 (Units 1203, 1207, 1222, 1512, and 1516);
3.	C4-1 (Unit 1228); and,
4.	C04-1 (Unit 1520).

Drawings of each floor plan and square footage can be provided to the contractor by submitting a request through email to michael.haack@grandforks.af.mil  

Final reports shall be compiled to include both A and B side of each duplex structure. The single units shall have their own individual report. The contractor shall generate 18 (16 duplex and 2 single) reports. Three copies of each unit shall be provided to: 

Stephen M. Braun, REM
319 CES/CEVC
525 Tuskegee Airmen Blvd
Grand Forks Air Force Base, ND 58205

This amendment removes that requirement. Toward that end, all responsible small business sources may submit a quotation in response to this solicitation. Offerors who submitted responses to RFQ#: VA-101-07-RQ-0048 are authorized to resubmit their original quotes as long as the capacity increase required by this solicitation is clearly addressed in the technical quote submission.

The period of performance for each awarded IDIQ shall be six months. Commercial Item specification addendums:  a) Each flag shall be neatly folded and individually packaged in a new corrugated cardboard carton (of any color) of appropriate size and design and of a sufficient strength so that it can be used as a mailing container without additional wrapping or reinforcing.

Technical capability shall be assessed using the results of the bid sample evaluation, technical criterion identified in item 6 and past performance.  Past performance shall be evaluated. In conducting the past performance assessment, the Government may use data obtained from other sources as well as from the quote. The evaluation will examine the offeror's actual performance on supplying similar flags and items and the relevance to the DVA interment flag procurement. The Government may contact some or all references provided by the offeror. Past performance information will be obtained through one or more of the following: Government past performance databases; references supplied by the offeror; and other sources of past performance information known to the Government, including commercial sources. Past performance will assess the offeror's performance history with its customers for the same or substantially the same government/commercial item (flags) manufactured from the same material and of substantially the same quality.
