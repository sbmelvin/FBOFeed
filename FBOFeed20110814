<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), intends to award a purchase order to Gerstel Inc., 701 Digital Drive, Suite J, Linthicum, MD 21090 to establish a follow-on maintenance agreement with Gerstel Inc. for the maintenance of SC3R and MPS2 gas chromatographic sampling systems, equipment, and accessories. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is 12 months. <br /><br />GERSTEL is the only known source that completely satisfies the Government's requirements, which are:
<p>&bull; Factory trained on the service and maintenance of CTC dual rail samplers<br />&bull; Prior experience with the service and maintenance of CTC samplers operated in conjunction with Agilent gas chromatographs.<br />&bull; Factory trained in the use of Maestro software for the operation of the CTC dual rail sampler<br />&bull; Factory trained in the integration of Maestro software with Agilent ChemStation software<br />&bull; Have a service engineer resident in the Atlanta metropolitan areas who can respond in 48 hours under normal conditions and be available 24/7 in times of national emergencies.</p>
<p>The operation of the sampler through the controlling software and the integration of the sampler controlling software with the Agilent ChemStation software controlling the GC-MS system to which the sampler is attached is critical to the performance of the combined instruments. The capability to properly integrate the controlling software is unique to GERSTEL.</p>
<p>Several market research techniques were used to identify other possible sources, including review of market research on similar items, queries of internet information sources, contact of knowledgeable individuals in the industry, and review of catalogs and product literature. There is currently no company or individual that has the ability to provide a service agreement for the GERSTEL systems. <br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Gerstel Inc. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the maintenance to Vallerie Redd VIA E-MAIL ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2011-Q-13681 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN July 28, 2011. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), intends to award a sole source contract to Borgwaldt KC, 7741 Whitepine Road, Richmond, VA 23237 for the acquisition of one LX20 linear smoking machine and one RM200A smoking machine.
<p><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is 9 months. <br /><br />The LX20 smoking machines are an industry standard. This smoking machine is designed identical to the current LX20 in the lab to serve as a backup to ensure optimal sample throughput and uptime to fulfill FDA50 project requirements.</p>
<p>The RM200A rotary smoking machine is the leader in rotary smoking machine technology. This smoking machine has three design features that make it superior to the current competition. The first design feature is that it will automatically load the cigarettes into the individual ports, reducing operator involvement and error in loading. Secondly, the smoking machine is enclosed in a chamber to limit operator exposure during smoking. Competitor rotary smoking machines do not have auto-loading functionality or integrated enclosures. Thirdly, it has the options of having a CO/CO2 analyzer or a NOx analyzer or both which is required for our current FDA50 projects.</p>
<p>Borgwaldt is the only company that sells the LX20 and RM200A. It is a proprietary smoking machine. The smoking machine being purchased is an identical system to that currently in use and will be used as a backup to increase throughput and uptime. The RM200A is the only smoking machine which automatically loads the cigarettes and with a NOx analyzer.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Borgwaldt KC. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Vallerie Redd VIA E-MAIL ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 99086 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN July 28, 2011. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples.(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.(2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>
