<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Warren, (ACC-WRN) intends to issue a three year, sole source Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contract to Hodges Transportation, Inc. DBA Nevada Automotive Test Center (NATC) of Carson City, NV. The proposed contract is to provide co-located fabrication, repair, maintenance, and storage of ballistic, blast, and automotive assets along with evaluation and analysis of ballistic, blast, and automotive evaluation events on assets being researched by the Tank Automotive Research Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) specifically in support of (ISO) the Occupant Centric Platform Technical Demonstrator (OCP TECD), the number one priority TECD program in the Army, and joint survivability efforts between the Army and the Marine Corps.
<p>NATC is the only source capable of timely providing the services required in a single location as a result of their unique facilities, test ranges, and automotive engineering test expertise. There is no known commercial or government site with the combination of evaluation environments, equipment, and instrumentation to simulate the mission profile and record vehicle capabilities that is required to meet the needs of this requirement.</p>
<p>NATC's facilities are uniquely situated where the terrain profile covers elevation ranges from below sea level to 10,000 feet in altitude and represents 85% of the world surfaces. NATC is the only test site that provides the Army with access needed to vehicle test courses and ranges that were developed over naturally occurring terrain features with the severity and roughness which physically replicates the Army cross country and off-road mission profile in order to effectively test the operational capabilities of Army automotive assets.</p>
<p>The Marine Corps uses NATC as their sole test center for their vehicle testing due to NATC's wide range of availability and capability. Contracting with NATC for this Army requirement allows for the needed standardization of the Army (TARDEC) and United States Marine Corps (USMC) mobility and survivability test operating procedures which will avoid future duplication of costs. To duplicate necessary range facilities and complete identical testing (100% comparable) by someone other than NATC would require substantial duplication of costs in order to modify/upgrade the test site, test equipment, and test operating procedures to meet the required range and testing capabilities for just the first task order, and much more so for the full effort anticipated.</p>
<p>The testing required will utilize NATC's unique automotive and blast capabilities. The majority of evaluation asset fabrication will be from Developmental Technical Data Packages (Level II) which require expertise in fabricating for blast (e.g. welds, instrumentation mounting). Few companies have experience in this type of ballistic fabrication and only NATC can now timely provide co-location of necessary fabrication and necessary evaluation services for the planned contract. Having this co-location will allow the Government to avoid additional substantial duplication of costs.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency if timely received after publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract after considering responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>All inquiries on this action can be submitted in writing miranda.e.smith5.mil@mail.mil. The solicitation will be posted on or about November 22, 2012.</p>

<DESC>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) to provide a Digital Asset Management System (DAMS) for the NATO HQ Public Office.
<p>NCIA has been authorized to use the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure, Best Value Procedures. The successful bid pursuant to this IFB will be that bid that is deemed to offer the best value in accordance with predefined bid evaluation criteria, which will be detailed in the IFB.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-13560-DAMS. The Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.</p>
<p>It is planned to place a single contract for the entire scope of work. No partial bidding will be allowed.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The DAMS project will focus on the creation and usage preparation of a repository containing all of NATO HQ's non-classified multimedia material, including documents, video, audio, and image files. This system will consist of four integrated parts:</p>
<p>1. A post-production video environment<br />2. A central digital media repository supported with metadata, search, workflow, and automation capabilities<br />3. A multi-level tiered storage capability to include fall-back storage for disaster recovery and business continuity<br />4. A front-end portal solution to provide multi-media access services to the HQ Public Office, the media, and other customers</p>
<p>The project will include all public digital assets that are currently held on local and external storage solutions used by the HQ Public Office.</p>
<p>The project will embrace all public digital assets in any of the following formats: video files (mpeg, avi ...), audio files (mp3, wav ...), imagery files (jpeg, tiff ...), and textual content (txt, doc, html, xml, pdf ...).</p>
<p>The project will address all public digital assets with the following classifications: non-classified / public.</p>
<p>The project will supplement all existing hardware, software, and interfaces to provide access services to and from current future users of DAMS. The incorporation of current NATO HQ digital content into the DAMS environment is in scope. The meta tagging for searchability and retrievability is not in scope.</p>
<p>The project will provide all necessary interfaces between existing NATO websites and the DAMS, social media and the DAMS, and LAN access to DAMS information/data by authorized users.</p>
<p>The DAMS solution must interact with the ICT infrastructure of the current HQ; therefore, it is essential that the architecture align with the current (NR2) architecture.</p>
<p>The DAMS solution must also interact with the NNHQ ICT infrastructure; therefore, it is essential that the DAMS architecture align with the NNHQ target architecture, which identifies relationships and interfaces between NNHQ projects and technical solutions.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB, which requires that the NATO member governments nominate to the bidders list those firms that are located within their borders. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. firm to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:<br />http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA. The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO-member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from the DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit completed one-time NATO ICB application): 26 November 2012<br /><br />- IFB planned to be issued December 2012</p>
<p>- Bid Closing planned for March 2013</p>
<p>- Contract Award expected to take place in May 2013</p>

<CONTACT>DANIEL L HERRING, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, Phone 717-770-6030, Fax 717-770-5689, Email daniel.herring@dla.mil
<DESC>The proposed contract action is for an acquisition for which DLA Distribution intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to procure the following Replacement Parts for a White Systems bottom drive Horizontal Carousel located at DLA Distribution Susquehanna, New Cumberland, PA:<br />Item 1) Part number PT-30-304-40734-000, NEMA enclosure assembly (includes the control, drives, safety relay, breaker, etc. completely wired) - quantity 2 EA<br />Item 2) Part number PT30-302-72633-000, 2HP motor assembly for 1 carousel dual (includes (2) 2HP motor with encoder) - quantity 8 EA <br />Item 3) Part number PT30-304-40733-000, Operator interface control (includes HMI control and pedestal) - quantity 8 EA<br />Item 4) Part number PT12307, Photoeye assembly (includes 2 photoeye and mounting hardware) - quantity 8 EA<br />Item 5) Part number PT53928, Remote reset station assembly (includes estop button, reset button, enclosure, and cable) - quantity 2 EA<br />Item 6) Part number PT41040, Home sensor assembly (includes sensor and mounting hardware) - quantity 8 EA
<p>White Systems/SencorpWhite is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of the bottom drive Horizontal Carousel located at DLA Distribution Susquehanna. As the OEM, White Systems/SencorpWhite is the only source that can provide these Replacement Parts because 1) the Replacement Parts must be compatible with the carousel onto which they will be installed (i.e., they must have the same form, fit, and function as the parts they will be replacing); 2) the carousel is obsolete and no longer in production; and 3) only White Systems/SencorpWhite possesses the necessary drawings and/or technical manuals needed to fabricate these Replacement Parts. In order to ensure that the performance, reliability and safety of this White Systems Horizontal Carousel is not compromised, the use of OEM replacement parts is required; the use of non-OEM replacement parts could be detrimental to the Government in terms of damage to the equipment. Accordingly, the Government intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price purchase order utilizing FAR Part 13 to White Systems/SencorpWhite to supply Replacement Parts for a White Systems bottom drive Horizontal Carousel.</p>
<p>Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 333922 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may respond by submitting qualifications/capabilities of the company to supply Replacement Parts for a White Systems bottom drive Horizontal Carousel by 4:00 PM Eastern time, Monday, November 26, 2012 to DLA Distribution, Acquisition Operations, J7-AB, J Avenue, Bldg 404, New Cumberland, PA 17070, Attn: Daniel Herring, Phone: 717-770-6030, FAX: 717-770-5689, e-mail: daniel.herring@dla.mil, for consideration by the agency. If no affirmative responses are received by 4:00 PM Eastern time, Monday, November 26, 2012 to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, a purchase order will be negotiated with and awarded to White Systems/SencorpWhite.</p>

<CONTACT>Neil M. Kern, Phone 5713452366, Email KernNM@State.gov - Kelly Bracey, Senior Contracting Officer, Phone 703-875-6298, Email BraceyKM@state.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of State intends to award a time and materials contract, with firm-fixed price and cost reimbursable elements, for local guard services at the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong, S.A.R. Local guard services are required to: prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; prevent destruction of assets; prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks. The Consulate requires a secure environment to conduct its mission. Duties will include, but are not be limited to, restricting entry of unauthorized personnel, the operation of walk-through and hand-held metal detectors, and the operation of electronic and hydraulic barriers. <br /><br />
<p>Each Contractor will be asked to provide fully burdened hourly rates for all labor categories (e.g., Guard, Senior Guard, and Supervisor). The fully burdened hourly rates for Standard Services as well as Additional or Emergency Services shall include all wages (local labor law compliance if applicable and any premiums relating to overtime, holidays, or night shifts), overhead, fringe benefits, severance costs, general and administrative expenses and profit for each category of labor.</p>
<p>Contractor performance will be monitored through a Quality Assurance and Surveillance Plan. For specific deficiencies in performance, the U.S. Government may deduct the estimated cost for the Government to provide the service in the absence of a contract employee or the additional administrative time incurred by the Government in correcting the performance deficiency.<br />For certain deficiencies such as an unmanned position, the negative incentive for not meeting the Performance Standard is a deduction in the billing amount at the Government's estimate cost for providing the required service not to exceed the length of the guard shift.</p>
<p>Some of the major tasks required of the Contractor are Entry Control (i.e., Office Building Entry Control, Official Residential Entry Control, Vehicle Entry and Access Control), Inspections, Use of Explosive and/or X-Ray Inspection Equipment, Patrols, Escort Services, Completion of Logs and Records, Operation of Closed Circuit Televisions, Use of a Guard Electronic Monitoring System, Operation of a Radio Network, and Implementation of a Contingency Plan capable of dealing with strikes and labor unrest should either occur.</p>
<p>The Government will solicit this requirement for full and open competition, using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15. The North American Industry Classification code for this procurement is 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services. The Government plans to award one contract. The anticipated period of performance is for one base year and four one-year options, which shall be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract. Additionally, all guards shall successfully complete an approved training program of instruction before being allowed to perform guard services. The basic training program shall consist of 80 hours of training and this requirement does not apply to guards who have previously successfully completed the training.</p>
<p>Guard/key personnel positions require a minimum Level 1 English language proficiency, which requires the ability to satisfy minimum courtesy requirements and maintain very simple face-to-face conversations on familiar topics. Certain positions require up to a Level 3 proficiency in English.<br /><br />The Government plans to issue the solicitation 15 days after the issuance of this synopsis, on the FedBizOpps site through addition to this synopsis. No paper copies will be mailed. All announcements and amendments made to this solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps; to receive updates, click the link for "Watch This Opportunity."<br /><br />The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: the synopsis will be posted for approximately fifteen (15) days and then the solicitation will be released and will remain open for sixty (60) days. The Question and Answer period begins when the solicitation is released and will end approximately four (4) weeks prior to the close of the solicitation. Proposals must be received by close of the sixty (60) day solicitation period; award will be made approximately sixty (60) days after proposal submission. All dates are subject to change; Offerors will be notified by amendment to the solicitation posted on FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>A site visit at the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong, S.A.R., is tentatively scheduled for twenty-one (21) days after the solicitation opens; a firm date will be announced at the time the solicitation is posted. Offerors are responsible for all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations in Hong Kong. Due to space limitations, only two representatives from each firm will be allowed to attend the site visit. Do not contact Consulate officials or personnel regarding any element of the solicitation, including the site visit. All proposals from responsible vendors will be evaluated if received on time. No questions concerning this requirement will be answered until the solicitation is posted. Once the solicitation is posted, questions may be submitted by email to Neil Kern at KernNM@state.gov; NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.</p>

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Denver Acquisition and Logistic Center (DALC), 555 Corporate Circle, Golden, CO  80401, intends to solicit for quotations from qualified and experienced community dialysis providers through full and open competition.

The prices shall be all-inclusive of equipment, facility, nursing, technical personnel, laboratory testing, drugs, supplies and professional services (social work and dietary), except Nephrologists.  CMS Medicare Program pricing is the basis from which all claims will be submitted and paid.

This acquisition will be conducted as a full and open competition for any and all qualified, experienced, and knowledgeable business entities, who can meet the requirements and whose pricing is considered fair and reasonable.  The North American Industry Classification System is 621492, Dialysis Centers and Clinics. The Small Business Size Standard is $34,500,000.00.

Award of a follow-on contract is expected in May 2013. This contract action will effectively extend the period of performance of the SE&amp;I services currently being acquired under Contract FA8807-12-C-0010, thereby providing SMC/GP sufficient time to complete a source selection, award a long-term follow-on contract, and allow sufficient transition time between the existing contract and the follow-on contract. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 5.207(e), the classification code for this synopsis is R (Professional, Administrative and Management Support Services).

<p>This contract will provide a highly capable SE&amp;I contractor/team to produce and manage the GPS technical baseline in support of SMC/GP.

The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (Service Disabled/Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB/VOSB), Hub zone, 8(a), small, small disadvantaged, woman owned small business, or large business) relative to NAICS 238210, Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors (size standard $14.0 million). Responses to this notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.

SPECIFIED REQUIREMENT: Network Contracting Office 7, Charleston, SC is seeking sources for a potential contractor to provide a Roam Alert Wander Guard System or a system with equal salient physical, functional, and performance characteristics.  The Roam Alert Wander Guard System is a solution for protecting patients who are prone to wandering in a non-restrictive way without a locked unit.  The Wander Guard System is installed in a building and wired with a rapid response radio frequency that sets off an alarm when residents who are wearing the corresponding transmitter bracelet attempt to exit the building without an escort.  The alarm panel displays the resident's exit site, which allows staff to immediately locate and redirect the resident back into a safe environment.  Residents who wear the bracelet are able to leave the facility in the company of family or other escorts using a bypass code that prevents the alarm from sounding.
The facility requires ten workstation licenses, one main power supply, four door controllers, two exciter antennas and access keypads for the main doors, 12 waterproof wrist tags, and system installation and training.  The facility also requires that the system be integrated with the existing Vocera phone system.

Please indicate whether your company is the manufacturer of the item.  If your company is not the manufacturer of the item, please provide evidence that your company is an authorized reseller and/or distributor of the item. Also include past experience in providing supplies to the VA, other Government (Federal or State) agency, or for a private facility. Please specify your availability to start date and your address. (2) BUSINESS SIZE AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS: (a) Indicate whether your business is large or small (b) If small, indicate if your firm qualifies as a small, emerging business, or small disadvantaged business (c) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and if your firm is certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (d) Indicate if your firm is a certified Hub-zone firm (e) Indicate if your firm is a woman-owned or operated business (f) Indicate if your firm is a certified Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) (g) Include the DUNS number of your firm. (h) State whether your firm is registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov and/or the VetBiz Registry at http://vip.vetbiz.gov/.

Responses must be emailed to Whitney.Warrington@va.gov no later than 5:00 p.m. EST, November 23, 2012. Your response should include both the STATEMENT OF CABABILITY and BUSINESS SIZE AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS information as explained above.

Synopsis:

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. There is no solicitation available at this time. This Sources Sought Notice is published for market research purposes only, and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quote (RFQ), or as an obligation on the part of the Government.
  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought, or otherwise pay for the requested information.  Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (NAVFAC EXWC) is seeking qualified businesses to demonstrate their ability to perform the work described below.  All qualified vendors may respond, and 8(a), HUBZONE Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and Small Business sources are especially encouraged to reply.  

The work that may be performed is for non-personal services. Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (NAVFAC EXWC) requires unique technical skills for support services required by the Centralized and Integrated Reporting for the Comprehensive Utilities Information Tracking System (CIRCUITS) program.
  General requirements are covered below, and specifics will be covered in future draft Statement(s) of Work (SOW).

The Centralized and Integrated Reporting for the Comprehensive Utilities Information Tracking System (CIRCUITS) is the Department of the Navys (DON) holistic Utilities and Energy Management (UEM) software solution.  It is a critical component required to comply with executive and legislative energy mandates Executive Orders 13423 and 13514; Energy Policy Act (EPACT) of 2005; Energy Independence and Security ACT (EISA) 2007 and others.  The software has modules in the production, test and development phases.  This effort is in direct support of the Utilities Payable (UP) module.
  UP is deployed world-wide in all Navy regions and NAVFAC Facilities Engineering Commands (FECs).  The services to be provided under possible future contracts are invoice processing for 80% of the Navys utility invoices, representing approximately $100 Million/month.  Vendors must demonstrate the capability for receipt and processing of approximately 40,000 Navy utility invoices annually including, but not limited to, electricity, water, sewage (wastewater), natural gas, LP gas and steam.

The invoice processing services include invoice scanning and processing, manual and automated data entry, maintenance and optimization of scanning and CIRCUITS data base interface. Program requirements call for the automatic scanning of invoices into the CIRCUITS database.
 Data must be optically retrieved off of the commercial invoice and placed in the correct field in the CIRCUITS database.

All contractor employees and subcontractors working on project sites are required to be US citizens in good standing with clean records. Many locations require all employees working on-site to pass a background investigation (e.g., check of National Law Enforcement data bases, interviews, etc.) before being granted site access. At least two employees will require IT2 level clearance and ability to receive and maintain a Common Access Card (CAC) to access CIRCUITS.

The purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to identify interested/qualified vendors, and to determine if if opportunities exist for the socioeconomic and small business programs provided in FAR part 19.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT. This is not a solicitation announcement. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntington District, is seeking preliminary marketing information from capable and reliable sources. This includes potential qualified small business sources such as 8(a), HUBZone, small disadvantaged and service-disabled veteran-owned businesses relative to North American Industrial Classification System code 237990, which has a size standard of $33.5 million in average annual receipts. The magnitude of construction for this acquisition is between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00.<br /><br />The project construction includes a base contract plus one (1) option. The Base Contract consists of the construction of a partial-depth seepage barrier approximately 4,500 ft. in length and a maximum depth of 145 ft. through the upstream slope of the dam embankment terminating in the left abutment. Option 1 consists of the construction of a grout curtain approximately 329 ft. in length by 60 ft. average depth in the left abutment of the dam from the end of the seepage barrier to near the emergency spillway. Responses shall include a qualifications statement along with documentation to support Technical Capabilities and Specialized Experience for the following:<br /><br />1. Seepage Barrier - The seepage barrier shall be a minimum of 24 inches wide through the entire length and depth, have an in-place permeability of less than 1 x 10-6 cm/sec at 28 days, and a minimum unconfined compressive strength of 750 pounds per square inch (psi) at 28 days. The completed seepage barrier shall be continuous and homogeneous, produced by either mix-in-place or excavation and replacement method. The seepage barrier will be installed through the dam embankment and into foundation materials of dense glacial outwash deposits consisting of sands, gravels, frequent presence of cobble zones and silt zones and small boulder instances, and high permeability open-work gravel/cobble zones. The seepage barrier will be partial-depth for a majority of its length, founded in fine to coarse grained silty sand with intermittent gravel zones, and terminate in the left abutment of the dam where the barrier will be constructed in hard sedimentary rock with unconfined compressive strengths ranging from under 1,000 to over 30,000 psi. The integrity of the existing dam must be maintained throughout the construction process and procedures developed for addressing emergency situations such as sudden slurry loss, excavation trench collapse, encountering boulders and open-work gravel/cobble zones.<br /><br />2. Seepage Barrier Quality Control and Verification- A Quality Control (QC) program will be required for proving and documenting that the minimum dimensions, continuity, homogeneity, strength, permeability, and quality requirements of the seepage barrier have been achieved. Quality control methods will ensure conformance with specifications, assure full-depth barrier continuity, and include verification borings and video camera surveillance of the in-place barrier backfill of the seepage barrier. Three-dimensional digital drawings, clear QC data presentation methods, and a dedicated staff for data collection, reduction and transmission to the Government will be required.<br /><br />3. Drilling and Grouting - An option for a double line grout curtain will consist of drilling, pressure testing and grouting of the bedrock located at the left dam abutment. Grout holes will be drilled at various orientations and inclinations. Temporary casing will be installed through soil materials and sealed with grout at the base of the casing. Grout holes will be drilled through casing and into bedrock, consisting of various sedimentary rocks types that have strengths ranging from under 1,000 to over 30,000 psi (unconfined compressive strength). The grout holes will be washed and pressure tested to determine if grouting is required. Balanced and stabilized grout mixes will be developed, mixed, delivered and injected into the grout holes, such as to seal all open features within the bedrock and significantly reduce groundwater seepage. Injected air and fluid pressures during drilling, pressure testing and grouting operations will be controlled to prevent damage by hydrofracturing of the bedrock and overlying soil. Pressure testing and grouting will be monitored using automated, real-time and computer-aided data acquisition systems.<br /><br /><br />Additionally, contractors are requested to provide the following Past Performance information: A list of relevant projects, current and/or completed, in the past five years that best demonstrates competence with this type of work; include dates, locations, types of contracts, dollar amounts/values, description of the work and references.<br /><br /><br />No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this sources sought or Government use of any information provided. The Government will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments.<br /><br /><br />Responses to this sources sought announcement must include the contractor's small business status (if applicable) such as 8(a), HUBZone, etc. Contractors are hereby encouraged to make known their interest in this type of work. All responsible sources may respond to this notice and all responses will be considered. Telephonic responses will not be honored. This is only a Request for Information. No award will result from this Sources Sought. Please email or fax your qualification statement to richard.d.horton@usace.army.mil, fax: (304) 399-5281 by close of business of November 21, 2012.

<p>1.0 - GENERAL</p>
<p>1.1 - SCOPE<br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) seeks a contractor to provide firearms shooting ranges and tactical training areas in support of the USCG's Maritime Security Response Team (MSRT) operational unit.</p>
<p>1.2 - BACKGROUND<br />MSRT is the Coast Guard's only counter-terrorism force with advanced interdiction capabilities and boarding skills. MSRT provides rapid response to Maritime Homeland Security/Maritime Homeland Defense operations. MSRT provides a highly specialized resource with advanced skills and tactics for non-compliant and high threat terrorist events in a counter-terrorism role. MSRT is trained to be a first responder to potential terrorist situations, deny terrorist acts, perform non-compliant security actions, perform tactical facility entry and enforcement, participate in port level counter-terrorism exercises, and educate other forces on USCG counter-terrorism procedures. These advanced skills and tactics require specific and frequent training to maintain a requisite high level of proficiency. MSRT units have a four-hour operational response deployment time as part of their important mission. Therefore, the USCG is seeking a facility to conduct MSRT internal skill-sustainment training for operational personnel to keep their tactical skills current and precise.</p>

<DESC>Title of Announcement: Intent to Announce Request for Unfunded Project Proposals (RUPP2) under Robotics OTA
This is not a Request for Unfunded Project Proposals, but for planning purposes only. A project award will not be awarded from this announcement. The Government intends to announce a Request for Unfunded Project Proposals for execution of a project award in support of Ground Robotics related research areas. The purpose of this announcement is to provide members of the Robotics Technology Consortium, and industry in general, advanced notification of Government intent. 
In December 2007, the Government announced its intent to enter into an Other Transaction Agreement with one (1) consortium in support of Ground Robotics related Research and Development projects. As a result of the Ground Robotics Industry Day in January 2008, one (1) consortium formed, the Robotics Technology Consortium. It is the intent of the Government to make multiple project awards to the members of the Robotics Technology Consortium as a result of member project proposals submitted via the Request for Project Proposals. 
The anticipated research areas for which project proposals will be sought are the following: (1) Enhancing Trust in Autonomous Behaviors; (2) Outdoor Semantic Mapping for Navigation; (3) GPS Denied High Precision Night Time Navigation and Mapping; (4) Omnidirectional Optical Communications for High-Bandwidth Operation; (5) Semantic Speech Interfaces for Robot Control; (6) Enhance Navigation via Obstacle Manipulation; (7) Wearable Human Robot Control. The Request for Unfunded Project Proposals (W15QKN-08-9-0001-RUPP2) will be issued to the Robotics Technology Consortiums Administrative Agent, the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, who will then issue the request to the members of the Consortium.

<SUBJECT>Request For Information - NLETS Automation
<SOLNBR>OPM15-13-R-0001
<RESPDATE>120412
<CONTACT>Leslie L. Henderson, Contract Specialist, Phone (724) 794-7172, Fax (724) 794-7199, Email leslie.henderson@opm.gov
<DESC>Request for Information<br />U.S. Office of Personnel Management - Federal Investigative Services
<p>Nlets Automation</p>
<p><br />1. Synopsis</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for informational and planning purposes, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals, or Request for Quotations. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract, nor do they affect a potential offertor's ability to respond to any future synopsis/solicitation which may or may not follow or restrict the U.S. Government's eventual acquisition approach.</p>
<p>Additionally, the U.S. Government will not provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Interested vendors responding to this RFI may provide capability information for all pieces of this requirement or for an entire solution. Respondents will not be notified of any results derived from a review of the information provided, however information gathered may be utilized for technical and acquisition purposes. Time permitting and depending upon the information received, individual vendors may be contacted for product demonstration. The U.S. Government will not pay for any costs associated with such demonstration(s) of any software products.</p>
<p>2. Background</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management, Federal Investigative Services (OPM-FIS) is responsible for conducting a majority of the background investigations (BIs) for the Federal Government to support suitability and national security clearances. Criminal history record searches are an integral part of this process. In an effort to streamline operations and increase efficiency OPM-FIS has, over the past several years, centralized much of the criminal history record searches. Currently, OPM-FIS has the capability to conduct manual queries through Nlets to all state repositories using the IQ, FQ, KQ and SWQ message keys.</p>
<p>Through this RFI, OPM-FIS is seeking information as to available and/or proposed products and services for a real time automation/batching capability that will allow for the submitting, receiving, flagging and parsing of Nlets queries and responses in XML format.</p>
<p>The proposed model must be able to support the current workload of 4,000 queries per day, and be able to support an additional 8,000-12,000 checks per day as the workload increases over the next 3 years.</p>
<p>3. Requirements</p>
<p>The contractor/model must: <br />1. Have capability to accept a real time data transfer from OPM-FIS's internal system. The data file will contain personal identifying data of subjects as well as case number and identifying flag(s) associated with each subject. The case number and identifying flag(s) will not be part of the query, but is intended to be used for tracking purposes only.</p>
<p>2. Be able to forward/send IQs/FQs, KQs, and SWQs to Nlets in the same format that is currently being used. Queries will be sent in real time, meaning that it must be conducted when a request is scheduled in the OPM-FIS case management system. Queries will be staggered so as not to inundate Nlets or any particular state at one time.</p>
<p>3. Apply algorithms/logic to determine if a possible match pertains to subject. Various algorithms may need to be developed depending on how each state provides possible match data. The algorithms for these states must be tested rigorously.</p>
<p>4. Apply algorithms/logic to account for no responses being received from a particular state (e.g., when states are experiencing a backlog in queue or downtime due to maintenance updates). Queries will be queued and re-sent to state until a response has been received.</p>
<p>5. Automatically execute an FQ if the IQ query returns with a hit.</p>
<p>6. Data transfer of results will be in XML format.</p>
<p>7. The system provided needs scalability to accommodate OPM-FIS as number of queries increases over the next 3 years.</p>
<p>8. Create a tracking mechanism where the results can be flagged, parsed and categorized. The users should be able to view results provided by Nlets in this system. Error messages, manual response message from a state and possible matches for which a determination could not be made as to whether match pertained to subject would also be sent to this system for follow up/processing.</p>
<p>9. Provide capability to run reports either standard or ad hoc to provide stats such as number of checks conducted for a specific time period sorted by type of check, state and lapse time for when query was sent and response was returned. Stats will also include identification of terminal operator (if manual query executed).</p>
<p>10. Determine if there is a problem either at Nlets or with a particular state repository and customer should be notified immediately.</p>
<p>11. Provide customer and technical support 24x7.</p>
<p>12. Responses including No Record responses that do not require any follow up with the subject (e.g., no self-admission) will be automatically updated in OPM's case management system (i.e., the system will read the NR responses).</p>
<p>13. Provide for Audit Log/Transaction Log tracking by User ID and/or User SID.</p>
<p>14. Provide for Audit Log/Transaction Log reporting capabilities.</p>
<p>15. Ensure system is FISMA compliant to ensure PII data is maintained per NIST Cyber Security Standards.</p>
<p>4. Instructions for Responding to RFI</p>

<SUBJECT>Data Coordinating Center for Sudden Cardiac Death in the Young Registry
<SOLNBR>CDC13-01DCC-SDY
<RESPDATE>112912
<ARCHDATE>12072012
<CONTACT>Gordon D. Barritt, Contracting Officer, Phone 770 488 2724, Fax 770 488 2044, Email ins4@cdc.gov
<DESC>Purpose<br />The Division of Reproductive Health (DRH) seeks information about organizational capacity for a data coordinating center (DCC) to serve a sudden death in the young registry. This registry will build on current the Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Case Registry and child death review activities.
<p>Background<br />Sudden death in the young (SDY) is a tragedy that affects children and young adults of all ages, making it a critical public health concern. Development of effective screening and prevention strategies is currently limited by the lack of prospectively defined epidemiological data, including incidence rates of specific causes of death (e.g., sudden cardiac death, sudden unexplained death in epilepsy). To address this knowledge gap, the CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are developing a program to explore and provide greater understanding of SDY by developing a surveillance system and registry that will broaden and enhance the activities of CDC's Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID) Case Registry. We expect many of the infant SDY cases to be a subset of the SUID cases.</p>
<p>The SUID Case Registry (http://www.cdc.gov/SIDS/) is a state-based surveillance system that builds on local and state child death review team programs. State grantees participate through a cooperative agreement with the CDC. Grantees agree to follow child death review procedures and protocols developed by the National Center for the Review and Prevention of Child Death (http://childdeathreview.org/ ). The National Center for the Review and Prevention of Child Death provides technical assistance to improve comprehensive child death reviews for the SUID Case Registry and for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. They also manage the web-based data entry system that all SUID Case Registry grantees use for monitoring and evaluating their child death review programs.</p>
<p>By building on the same SUID Case Registry infrastructure, CDC and NIH will develop the SDY registry, the first US prospective, multi-state surveillance system to improve knowledge about SDY incidence. Similar to child death review and SUID case review, multidisciplinary teams will review and enter data from death certificates, medical records, death scene investigations, and pathology reports. In addition, a serum sample for DNA extraction will be collected from a subset of cases. <br />The SDY Registry and surveillance system's objective are: <br />&bull; To prospectively identify and review SDY cases from birth to 24 years of age in up to 15 states by building upon current SUID Case Registry activities for state-based surveillance;<br />&bull; To build upon the current web-based data entry system used by state and local child death review teams and SUID Case Registry grantees; <br />&bull; To collect and store biospecimens from registry cases that can be used by NIH-grantees to improve knowledge about SDY etiologies.</p>
<p>Core Skills and Tasks<br />The core tasks of the contract will include: <br />1. Train state grantees and corresponding child death review teams to identify and review all SDY cases<br />2. Develop a monitoring and evaluation plan including a quality improvement plan with state grantees to improve timeliness and reduce missing and unknown data.<br />3. Build upon and maintain relationships with state, regional and/or local child death review teams, health department personnel, child protection services, medical examiners/coroners, pathologists, pediatricians (including specialists in cardiology and neurology), etc.<br />4. Convene planning meetings with experts (medical examiners, coroners, pathologists, death investigators, pediatricians including specialists in cardiology and neurology, etc.) to plan the SDY Registry, including its methods, reports, and evaluations. <br />5. Assemble a Medical Examiner Panel charged with developing a standardized autopsy protocol for evaluating a case of SDY, including the collection of biospecimens, and recommending how to best incorporate medical examiners/coroners into the registry activities.<br />6. Develop a governing structure for the SDY Registry, including a Steering Committee and related sub-committees.<br />7. Develop a procedure for the collection of serum at autopsy to include consent as required.<br />8. Train medical examiners and/or pathologists to collect and ship serum samples per established SDY Registry protocol<br />9. Store biospecimens in a biorepository that meets NIH standards or sub-contract with an appropriate biorepository. <br />10. Develop a procedure and mechanism to make biospecimens available to the scientific community.</p>
<p>Potential DCC's should have the following current in-house capability and capacity:<br />1. Staff expertise and experience in creating and sustaining child death review systems (or similar death review systems) in states and local communities <br />2. Staff expertise and experience in building and maintaining collaborative relationships with individuals and organizations involved in the child death review process.<br />3. Experience and expertise in the development and maintenance of a web-based electronic data entry system with case report forms, including adherence to federal and state privacy and security laws. <br />4. Staff, facilities and infrastructure necessary to create supplemental variables to the pre-existing data entry system and case report forms, update the data dictionary and provide quarterly data sets. <br />5. Staff expertise in providing technical assistance and training for the multidisciplinary review, data entry and data quality improvement for SDY cases using child death review and SUID Case Registry protocols and procedures.<br />6. Current relationships with state, regional and/or local child death review teams, health department personnel, child protection services, medical examiners/coroners, pathologists, pediatricians (including specialists in cardiology and neurology), etc.</p>
<p>Capacity Statement:<br />Capacity statements should clearly detail relevant expertise and the ability to perform the tasks described in this notice as described. Examples of prior completed government contracts of similar nature, references and other related information should be included. The capacity statements may not to exceed seven pages in length, shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone/fax/email, and business size and status (e.g. small business, 8 (a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women owned small business).</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER
<p><br />Subject Matter Expert and Training Services for OCDETF/AFMLS Financial Investigations Seminars</p>
<p>This announcement is a notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order to Ms. Lenora Keener in accordance with FAR Part 13 "Simplified Acquisition Procedures" and FAR Part 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". The applicable NAICS Code is 611430 - Professional and Management Development Training and the size standard is $10 Million Dollars.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice, Justice Management Division, intends to award a sole source purchase order to Ms. Lenora Keener to serve as a Subject Matter Expert and to provide training services in support of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF)/Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section (AFMLS) Financial Investigations Seminars (FIS) during FY 2013.

<p>In 2003, OCDETF with AFMLS launched the Financial Investigations Initiative to teach agents, prosecutors, investigators, and other staff to trace, track, follow, and forfeit illegally obtained funds. To achieve its mission, OCDETF/AFMLS conducts many complex multi-district and international criminal investigations and civil actions that require prosecutors, agents, investigators, and other staff who are knowledgeable, experienced, and skilled in financial investigations, money laundering, and asset forfeiture. The challenges include identification of technology to track, trace, and follow assets; analysis of financial documents; and understanding of complex asset forfeiture and money laundering statutes; and this necessitated the development of the Financial Investigations Curriculum and Seminars.</p>
<p>Ms. Keener is a retired DEA Financial Intelligence Unit Chief with more than 30 years of experience, has taught financial analysis techniques nationally and internationally, and is an expert in the field of research and operations dealing with the intelligence analysis process. OCDETF has engaged the services of Ms. Keener to teach, update, revise, and enhance the Basic Financial Investigations Curriculum since it was developed in 2003 and she has assisted in the development, instruction, and facilitation of several modules of the curriculum, including <em>Organizing a Financial Investigation and Creating a Money Flow Chart</em>. Ms. Keener has a long working relationship with the asset forfeiture community and she has taught and facilitated at close to 80 Financial Investigations Seminars since 2003. As a result, Ms. Keener has unique qualifications that make her a sole source capable of fulfilling the Department of Justice requirement in an efficient and cost effective manner.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, the Department of Justice will consider any capability statements submitted by interested parties (including company name, DUNS Number, and verification of SAM Registration) via email to Regina Williams, Contracting Officer, at <a href="mailto:regina.williams5@usdoj.gov">regina.williams5@usdoj.gov</a>&nbsp;by no later than 12:00 noon, Eastern Standard Time, on Friday, November 23, 2012.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Collaboration with Industry</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>1. General Information</strong></p>
<p>Early and frequent interaction and collaboration with business and industry is increasing in its importance to NGA-and to how NGA can benefit from the innovations and technical expertise available through focused communication with our industry partners. Advance collaboration will improve the way NGA does business and accelerate our understanding and application of emerging commercial processes and technologies.</p>
<p>Many of our shortcomings relate to strategic and acquisition planning, contract administration, and program oversight. These shortcomings directly relate to the competency and knowledge base levels of our integrated acquisition workforce. Other issues of concern include:</p>
<p>&bull; Organizational conflict of interest (OCI) rules are not standardized across the agency<br />&bull; Risk tolerance is low <br />&bull; Productive competition is often hampered by unclear, inconsistent policies and cumbersome requirements<br />&bull; Momentum for integration of our acquisition, engineering, and budget processes is moving too slowly<br />&bull; Efforts to enhance communications and collaboration are maturing at too slow a pace</p>
<p>NGA's overarching strategy is to collaborate with industry over a sustained period of time -- to listen, learn, and improve. As we move forward, this will involve large and small group sessions targeted toward both traditional and non-traditional NGA contractors. NGA Deputy Director Mike Rodrigue is committed to engaging business leaders in on-going discussions on what NGA might do to improve our business practices and leverage industry expertise in developing innovative solutions to long term issues. NGA recently completed the first in a series of in-house meetings to introduce the concept of business collaboration with acquisition professionals. As a follow-on to that meeting, a large group event is in the planning stages to include both industry and acquisition professionals together in a problem solving session. This will occur on 11 December 2012 and be followed up with multiple small group sessions throughout calendar year 2013.</p>
<p><strong>2. NGA Government-Industry Discussion Questions</strong></p>
<p>In listening to industry partners and professionals across NGA, several themes continue to arise that will serve as initial topics for NGA-industry collaborative discussions:<br /><br /><strong>OCI</strong></p>
<p>1. OCI has been a concern for some time now, with profound effects on industry. Given the legislative atmosphere and the way NGA has been addressing OCI, what recommendations do you have for making this issue more manageable? <br />2. Do you foresee the need for any further corporate restructuring to accommodate OCI? <br />3. How do you see NGA improving procedures to avoid OCI issues?</p>
<p><strong>Barriers to Competition</strong></p>
<p>4. Does NGA's handling of competitive procurements provide sufficient opportunities for your purposes? What changes can you recommend to improve the process? <br />5. What suggestions could you provide that would help expand access and remove barriers to increase competition on NGA procurements? <br />6. How could we allow better access to NGA buildings and decision makers?</p>
<p><strong>Procurement Processes</strong></p>
<p>7. What practices could NGA adopt that would allow for more rapid acquisition of technology and services?</p>
<p><strong>Workforce</strong></p>
<p>8. What recommendations do you have to enhance the NGA workforce's competencies to handle the award and execution of complex IT contracts? <br />9. What could NGA do that would better enable it to develop and retain its IT acquisition expertise?</p>
<p><strong>Risk</strong></p>
<p>10. NGA portrays itself as an organization with a transformative vision. Does our willingness to accept risk support this characterization?<br />11. Most NGA source selection decisions are based on a Best Value approach. Do you believe this to be reality, or do you believe that the decisions are driven by the lowest bids?</p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<p>12. How might NGA balance an increased focus on more open communication with industry on procurement opportunities without increasing exposure to more industry protests? <br />13. What do you believe we could do to increase communication during the acquisition process (pre/post award)? <br />14. What can NGA do to minimize its risk to protests by unsuccessful offerors while maintaining its ability to engage with industry in a more collaborative and communicative environment? What can you (industry) do to allay the government's concerns?<br />15. How satisfied are you today with the level of communication afforded by NGA throughout the acquisition process? Is communication better at sometimes than others? What can we do to improve these communications?</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, at the National Cancer Institute, Pharmaceutical Management Branch and Office of Acquisitions intends to negotiate a sole source modification for a three (3) month extension to the contract with Fisher BioServices, Inc. to continue storing and distributing clinical agents for CTEP.</p>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB), Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI), is charged with providing pharmaceutical support for clinical trials sponsored and/or funded by the National Cancer Institute. The DCTD sponsors intramural and extramural research for the clinical evaluation and development of potentially effective cancer treatments. CTEP administers, coordinates, and funds these clinical trials, as well as supports other clinical research initiatives. The program fosters collaborations within the cancer research community and works extensively with the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.</p>
<p>Statutory authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Fisher BioServices, Inc. is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB), CTEP, in providing pharmaceutical support for cancer clinical trials sponsored and funded by the DCTD, NCI, manages the Contractor who provides a facility and project team to receive, store, distribute and account for the final disposition of clinical agents for open-label and double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials and maintains necessary records of all aspects of the process. This contract also supports agent distribution services for clinical trials of other NCI Divisions and Programs, preclinical drug development research of NCI grantees, academic institutions, Cooperative Groups, and Cancer Centers, and a compassionate-use distribution program that provides promising new agents to physicians whose patients could benefit. The NCI Clinical Repository is currently open and accessible during regular business hours (8:30 AM - 5:00 PM, Eastern Time), Monday through Friday, except for official Federal Government holidays. An occasional evening, night, or weekend emergency shipment has been necessary.</p>
<p>Fisher BioServices, Inc. is uniquely qualified by virtue of its continued performance for this period of time and is the only source that can provide services at this time.</p>
<p>The purpose of extending this contract is to complete the following tasks:</p>
<p>1)To receive, store, and distribute commercial and investigational agents consisting of chemotherapeutic agents, biologic products (e.g., cytokines, monoclonal antibodies, oncolytic viruses, gene therapy, and vaccines), small-molecule targeted agents and other therapeutic anticancer agents.</p>
<p>2)To receive and inspect agents from manufacturers and suppliers throughout the world. Agents shall be relabeled or supplemental labels applied as necessary to meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and NCI guidelines for completeness and clarity of labeling.</p>
<p>3)To store agents in a secure, monitored, fire protected warehouse under specified controlled temperature conditions (room temperature, refrigerated, and frozen at both 20oC and 70oC). An average of 600,000 units (vials, ampules, bottles of tablets, etc.) is maintained in storage at any one time, but can vary greatly depending on the activities of the Program. This contract requires handling, storage, shipping, and disposal of hazardous and biological materials.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to continue with one source under authority FAR 6.302. However, interested sources may identify their interest and capability must respond by submitting a capability statement (5 page limit) within 15 days of publication of this synopsis.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Overnight deliveries should be mailed to Charlotte McCormack at the National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, Suite 600, Bethesda, Maryland 20852. No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted. Respondents may submit their capability statements via email at mccormackc@mail.nih.gov.</p>

This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov   and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.

<DESC>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets &amp; Threat Simulators (PM ITTS) has a requirement to provide continued operations and support of the National Cyber Range (NCR) effort. The NCR was originally developed by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and transitioned to the Office of the Secretary of Defense/Test Resources Management Center in 2012. The NCR is comprised of a series of custom configured Government and Lockheed Martin owned hardware and software housed in a specially architected Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility with appropriate security protocols to allow execution of missions through Top Secret/Special Access Programs (TS/SAP). The NCR emulates the public internet and other networks, and provides for the modeling of cyber attacks as well as the test and evaluation of cyber attack impacts upon that infrastructure with the ability to rapidly (in less than 1 day) reconfigure between events and to simultaneously execute parallel events at multiple security levels (unclassified through Top Secret) as required. This NCR follow-on is required to continue the work executed under prior contracts and tests to ensure that the Government maintains a consistent and repeatable modeling and testing environment that enables replication of past events and findings. PEO STRI/PM ITTS intends to award a five year (one base year and four option years) Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract to Lockheed Martin to fulfill this requirement on or around June 1, 2013. The anticipated contract award dollar amount is $80M over five years. <br /><br />The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 &ldquo;Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement&rdquo;. The NCR custom made software is coupled and integrated with a custom configured set of computer and networking hardware. Any reconstruction of the NCR in the same or a different facility (even if established with the current equipment) would place the laboratory in a different electromagnetic environment with unknown effects on event repeatability and reproducibility. The NCR must remain in the same physical, virtual, and environmental (to include electromagnetic effects) configuration. Additionally, the techniques and procedures to execute NCR testing are specific to this hardware/software mix, and must be continued. The Government must also continue to obtain these highly specialized services from Lockheed Martin and the current NCR facility to avoid substantial duplication of cost not expected to be recovered through competition and result in an unacceptable delay in fulfilling agency requirements. <br /><br />This notice is provided to verify that no other sources can meet this requirement. Contractors who believe they are capable of meeting the program requirements should contact the Contract Specialist via electronic mail by 23 November 2012 @ 1200hrs. (Eastern) indicating their capabilities. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Capability statements should not exceed eight (8) pages (including the cover sheet, table of contents, etc). Contractors are advised that a determination by the Government not to compete this effort based on any responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products. No funds are available to pay for preparation of responses to this notification. The Government will use the information received to determine whether other sources are available and capable to satisfy this requirement.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Cunning Running Software, Incorporated - 9732 Thorn Bush Drive, Fairfax Station, Virginia, 22039-2537, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, for an extended maintenance Agreement of the type already in use as part of the TSA Contract HSTS02-07-D-SSA002.
<p>This notice of intent does not constitute a Request for Proposal.<br /><br />The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has been charged with the responsibility of securing our nation's transportation systems. In turn, TSA's Office of Security Assessments [OSA] is tasked with securing the aviation community against the use of Manned Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) against commercial aviation. Common examples of MANPADS are Mortars, Rifles and Rocket-Propelled Grenade Launchers. The Homeland Security Presidential Directives 5 and 7, the Aviation Transportation Security Act of 2001 (ATSA), and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act 0f 2004 require TSA to conduct MANPADS assessments at high risk airports throughout the U.S.</p>
<p>In order to fully and successfully conduct risk assessments, the OSA purchased proprietary software developed by Cunning-Running Software, LTD of Great Britain (parent company of US-based Cunning-Running Software, Inc.)under TSA Contract No HSTS02-07-D-SSA002. The Software is fully capable of calculating the probability of a successful MANPADS attack from a given location using all available data (type of MANPADS, location, terrain, visibility, etc.). <br /><br />During the past 5 years, TSA has purchased from Cunning-Running Software, Incorporated, software licensing; TSA owns the software. The purchase of additional software and licensing is neither required nor anticipated. This sole source effort procures a fixed-price, 3-year maintenance agreement only for software maintenance and support of the proprietary software owned by the Agency.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received within thirty [30] days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government, who, in this case, previously purchased the required software. Any information received will therefore be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to issue a Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) delivery order for an <span style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line">extended warranty for hardware, software, and ADP support for the Q-Matic queuing management system that will provide corrective service in the event of a problem. The vendor must be an authorized reseller of Q-Matic products, services and licenses.</span> The vendor shall perform in accordance with the attached Request for Quote.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Brand Name Rationale:
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The Internal Revenue Service has Q-Matic queuing management systems in approximately 390 locations in Field Assistance areas nationwide. The existing systems use proprietary hardware and software that cannot be duplicated, substituted, or serviced, by any other vendor unless they are an authorized reseller of Q-Matic products, services and licenses. The systems integrate with the existing IRS queuing management systems, Tier B programs, and IRS network infrastructure. The system is networked to provide online access to customer service statistics. Q-Matic provides a proprietary commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) networking solution for these systems that is uniquely capable of providing the queuing and management information that will address IRS' strategic plans for improved customer service, employee satisfaction and business results. </span></p>
<p><span style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: line">The Q-Matic <a name="OLE_LINK2">Queuin</a>g Management System is an on-line system available at selected major Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs) to facilitate workload and resource distribution by screening and categorizing taxpayer needs at the point of registration. The use of automated customer queuing management systems enables Field Assistance (FA) to more efficiently monitor and control customer traffic flow, and gather critical data for trend analysis in areas that include but are not limited to staffing, training, budgeting, and forecasting. <br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><br />The IRS has no plans to replace the existing Q-Matic queuing system and plans to continue utilizing the Q-Matic hardware and software. Thus, this acquisition is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company as such, an extended warranty must be purchased in order to ensure continued maintenance of the existing Q-Matic hardware and software. <br /></span><br />This purchase order will be made under the Authority of FAR Part 11.105 - Items peculiar to one manufacturer and FAR Part 52.211-6<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Brand Name or Equal.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>Contractor shall create a user-level forensically sound read-only implementation of the exFAT file system. This implementation shall be integrated with Version 3.2.3 of The Sleuth Kit (initially) and the version of The Sleuth Kit that is current at the time of final delivery.

Code developed by the contractor shall be made freely available and will be licensed on terms that are similar to and consistent with existing Sleuth Kit. Specifically, the mmls command will be modified to list exFAT partitions; the fsinfo command will be modified to print information about exFAT file systems; the fls command will list exFAT directories; and the icat command will output the contents of exFAT files. Other SleuthKit commands will be modified as appropriate.

End users will not be required to license Microsoft technology or intellectual property in order to make legal use of the contractors code.

Code shall be delivered with 5 public release disk images that can be used for tool testing and validation.
 These images will demonstrate 1) normal file recovery; 2) recovery of deleted files from an allocated directory; 3) recovery of deleted files from a deleted directory; 4) recovery of files and metadata from a disk that has been reformatted as a FAT file system; 5) recovery of files and metadata from a disk that has been reformatted as a NTFS file system. Contractor must provide a written explanation of each recovery operation that inherently cannot be performed as a result of the exFAT architecture. The images will be self identifying in that each file and directory will have a distinct name, and every file will have a distinct set of contents. An answer key will be provided with the disk images.

Contractor unit prices, when incorporated into a Government contract, will be released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) without further notice to the contractor submitter.  If the Contractor takes issue with the release, it should submit its proposal data with the appropriate legends and explain in detail why such data cannot be released as a public record under the Freedom of Information Act.

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation: The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible Offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government considering price and price related factors.
 The Government intends to award the contract to the eligible, low-priced, responsible offeror (see FAR 15.304).  Award will be made upon price reasonableness determination, contractor determination of responsibility within the meaning of FAR Part 9, and acceptance to the provisions set forth herein. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
(i)	Ability to perform per the statement of work
(ii)	Price
The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i). (The Government will not, however, provide additional credit for those proposals that may exceed the standards.)
Offerors proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria.
 Under this factor, the Government will rate the company as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 
Offerors proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria. Under this factor, the Government will rate the vendors ability to perform per the statement of work as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to receive a rating of acceptable for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 
Only those Offers which meet the minimum requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factor (ii).
 The Government will then rate the vendors ability to perform per the statement of work as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to receive a rating of acceptable for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 
For those proposals that are rated acceptable on Factor (i), the Government will then evaluate Factor (ii), Ability to meet the requirements and ability to perform per the statement of work, when combined, are equal to price. 
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.
(b) ABILITY TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS, Factor (ii), will be assessed by evaluating the vendors responses to the requirements.
 
(c) The Governments statement of work is attached. Ability to meet the statement of work shall be demonstrated by the offerors submission of a Word document that addresses how they will accomplish all applicable objectives, tasks and guidelines.  
A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or electronically furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
 
This announcement will close at 1 PM PST on 19 November 2012.  Submit offers via email to Allison Stridh who can be reached at (T) 562.626.7426 or email Allison.stridh@navy.mil .  All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>BASIS FOR AWARD:<br />Award will be made to the responsible, technically acceptable quoter, whose quote, conforming to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation, offers the lowest evaluated price.</p>

Vendor will be notified by MSFSC of personnel who are denied access to the vessel.</p>
<p>Base/Repair Facility Access: Permit is required to access Navy facilities. Base/Repair Facility Access Request is desired seven days prior to ship check or performance start date. Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT 1 TO ANNOUNCEMENT (Posted on 11-9-2012) The FAA received two questions about this planned Industry Day.  Here are the questions along with FAA's responses:  
QUESTION:  Is it necessary to register for Industry Day?  
FAA RESPONSE:  Yes attendees are required to register ahead of time.  Register on-line via this web site (as shown in the initial announcement):  
	www.faaindustryforum2012.eventbrite.com
Due to the needs of planning and logistics for the event, we will stop the registration on Monday, November 26, 2012 at 4:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time.  In fact, registration may "max out" before that date since we have space for a finite number of attendees.  We plan to allow only those folks that register to attend the forum.  We have space for approximately 480 attendees.  As of November 8, 2012, there were approximately 350 individuals registered.  
QUESTION:  Will the Industry Day scheduled for Nov 28/29/30 represent the TFDM Industry Day that has been discussed previously? Or is this a separate event from the planned TFDM Industry Day? Is there going to be a separate Industry Day that addresses only TFDM issues? 
FAA RESPONSE:  The previously discussed TFDM Industry Day is fully integrated into this event.  Given the close relationships between many of these programs/systems, the FAA has decided to host one comprehensive event in the place of several independent program Industry Days.  

ORIGINALLY POSTED ANNOUNCEMENT (Posted on 11-7-2012):  
"The Sky Is the Limit!" -- FAA Industry Forum 2012 Sponsored by the FAA ATO Program Management Organization

<DESC>PEO LCS Technology Day will be held on 30 November 2012 at Building 40 within Naval Surface Warfare Center (NWSC) Carderock in West Bethesda, MD.  The event will begin at 0800 and is estimated to end at 1600 EST. This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposal.  The event will be held at the Distribution D level and is open to DOD government and DoD contracted US industry representatives only.
Technology Day will formally launch the PEO LCS Rapid Technology Insertion (RTI) process as described in the approved PEO LCS Science & Technology (S&T) Investment Strategy. This event is planned to be held on an annual basis.  Technology candidates for the upcoming Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) that will support the RTI process should be considered mature technologies at the start of the process to facilitate rapid insertion.

There is an overall interest at PEO LCS in advanced software and hardware technology improvements that could help the LCS successfully complete its primary missions of countering diesel submarine threats, littoral mine threats, and surface threats, such as small surface craft attacks.
  The technology focus areas for PEO LCS will be announced at Technology Day.  Although the scope of the topics under these focus areas  this year may be limited, the broader intent of Technology Day is to facilitate communication of LCS technology needs and potential provider solutions to better guide Rapid Technology Insertion efforts in the future.

In this initial year of the process, the funding allocated to this BAA will be small.  Funding will be expanded appropriately in future years.

PEO LCS requests that firms interested in attending the PEO LCS Technology Day submit company names and attendee lists by 1400 EST, 26 November 2012 via e-mail to Donald Park at dopark@caci.com.  Companies are limited to two representatives each as seating is limited.
  All attendees are required to present government-issued photo identification upon entry to the event. 

This announcement is for informational planning purposes, does not constitute a formal solicitation or request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Attendance at the Technology Day and any discussion/release of information is strictly voluntary.  Any formal solicitation will be announced at a later date.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this requirement at any time during the acquisition process.  The Government will not be responsible for any associated costs as a result of prospective offerors interest and/or response to this notice or future solicitation.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.    While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane.

THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE TO ONLY THE CONTRACTOR UNDER N00164-08-D-JN32.

  The contract was awarded on an other than full and open competition basis, to Dillon Aero, Inc.

The basis for restricting competition for this contract action is the proprietary rights of Dillon Aero, Inc. and the duplicative costs to the Government to procure supplies from another source, and conduct the necessary testing and certification to satisfy the Governments stated requirements.  The extension will afford the Government time to develop a technical data package adequate to achieve competition for follow-on contracts.
  Delivery requirements shall be F.O.B. destination and inspection and acceptance shall occur at the destination in accordance with the terms of the contract.  The ceiling value of the basic contract is 29,999,959.44 USD and remains unchanged as a result of this modification, however the ceiling value of all requirements procured within the extended ordering period shall not exceed 5,025,000 USD.

NSWC, Crane Division does not currently own or have in its possession, an approved technical data package for the required supply items.  Therefore, specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described herein are not available and cannot be furnished by the Government; please do not submit requests.

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
  A determination by the Government to not compete the anticipated contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The solicitation and all changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be provided directly to Dillon Aero, Inc. and those offerors that submitted a capability statement, proposal, or quotation.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed.  Interested sources must request the document via e-mail, from the government POC listed below.
