<p>This statement of work covers several specific areas of innovation and emerging technologies, including: optimization of distance-learning capabilities; organizational agility to support new USAF mission areas and command-structure research; enhancement of ET/IT infrastructure performance and cost-efficiency; research recommendations for implementation of ET/IT cost-avoidance projects; and more ready access for AU/A4/6 personnel to current ET/IT research.<br /><br />The vendor must deliver Web- and phone-based service that provides access to time-proven, impartial research information. This would enable the directorate to capitalize on ED/IT technology, as well as current and emerging markets, as they relate to the education sector. This information and data must be presented in a style suitable for the staff of an educational establishment. Each authorized user at AU/A4/6 would have an individual user ID and password to access the vendor's website(s) or verify credentials on the phone.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the ET/IT Research and Advisory Services should consist of:<br />- Targeted research in the ET/IT market<br />- Live access to analysts for tailored solutions<br />- Analysts' reports detailing studies and recommendations<br />- Alerts on items of interest furnished online and via e-mail<br />- Reviews of current technologies impacting the AU/A4/6 mission<br />- Peer-to-peer access to conferences and symposia relating to the AU/A4/6 mission<br />- Expert advice and recommendations on the workforce, skills, and knowledge required to operate and maintain the AU/A4/6 ET/IT enterprise<br />- Review of existing AU/A4/6 ET/IT portfolio with recommendations and most-applicable industry best practices for expanding in an expeditious manner<br />- Review of existing governance structure and process with recommendations for improvement specifically tailored for the AU/A4/6 ET/IT environment and mission<br />- Reports on technology hype cycles to provide a snapshot of emerging and maturing technologies and infrastructure (e.g., topics in wireless, cloud computing, security, networking, and hardware infrastructure)<br />- Review of costs associated with the AU/A4/6 ET/IT enterprise compared to other similar-scope educational institutions as well as government and commercial organizations-with recommendations for containing and reducing costs</p>
<p>Customers supported: Air University, Maxwell AFB, AL</p>
<p>3. Special Requirements</p>
<p>- Training. AU/A4/6 member(s)/delegate(s) receiving research or advisory licenses must receive, or at least be offered, vendor-provided instruction, online or via email, on the use of the research and advisory services IAW this Statement of Work. Training should be of sufficient nature-length, depth, and/or breadth-to familiarize them on how to use and navigate the system.</p>
<p>- Registration. While it is the responsibility of AU/A4/6 to establish personnel requiring research and advisory services, the vendor should establish and maintain user identification credentials, user IDs, and passwords.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list.

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

If Government is an agency of the federal government, Government shall have no greater rights than RESTRICTED RIGHTS with respect to the Software; provided, however, that, with respect to any data generated or compiled by the Software, the Department of Defense shall have no greater rights than set forth in subparagraph (c)(1(ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software clause at DFARS 252.227-7013 (OCT.

5.	Export Restriction.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

CPT Sara Kimsey 760-380-3852, kimseyntc12-01@hotmail.com<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>2. Section 1.4 "Quality Control" of the Statement of Work is hereby <strong>deleted</strong> in its entirety and <strong>replaced</strong> with the following Section 1.4 "Quality Control":</p>
<p>1.4 QUALITY CONTROL</p>
<p>The contractor shall develop and maintain an effective quality control program to ensure services are performed in accordance with this SOW. The contractor shall develop and implement procedures to identify, prevent, and ensure non-recurrence of defective services. The contractor's quality control program is the means by which he assures himself that his work complies with the requirement of the contract. The Quality Control Plan is to be delivered with the contractors' proposal. After acceptance of the quality control plan the contractor shall receive the contracting officer's acceptance in writing of any proposed change to his QC system.</p>
<p>MSHA may elect to perform a site visit prior to contract award, and to perform a Quality Assurance audit during the contract term.</p>
<p>In addition to participating in the Proficiency in Analytical Testing program, the Contractor will institute and maintain an internal proficiency testing program for designated analyses requested by MSHA on a recurring basis. The proficiency testing will be performed on a quarterly basis on a set of blind samples prepared or procured by the Contractor.

<ARCHDATE>10242011
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a follow-on sole source Fixed Price contract to The Council of State Governments to perform comprehensive assessments based on existing Emergency Management Standard and assessment processes and assesses all levels of emergency management within the US Army Corps of Engineers.  Assessments will be completed for the Corps districts, divisions and headquarters to serve as a baseline capability assessment of each program as a foundation for structuring and monitoring improvement efforts over the next several years.  The Council of State Governments affiliate EMAP is the sole agency approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as the only entity who can provide jurisdiction and Federal Program Accreditations which is at least half of the intent of this initiative.  The assessments will employ subscription, application, self-assessment, on-site assessment, assessment report and Program Review Committee steps of the EMAP process and Commission decision on accreditation if a program chooses to pursue.  In addition, assessment reports would be provided to USACE headquarters to track progress over time with compliance.  <br><br>This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will proceed with awarding a Fixed Price contract to The Council of State Governments for these services.  <br><br>The Government shall purchase a minimum of $50,000.00 and a maximum of $600,000.00 worth of services per year, or $3,000,000.00 over five years.<br>
