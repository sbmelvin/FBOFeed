<CONTACT>Vallerie M Redd, Contract Specialist, Phone 770-488-2845, Fax 770-488-2670, Email gfj3@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS), intends to award a sole source contract to Thermo Scientific Portable Analytical Instruments, Inc., (Thermo Scientific) 46 Jonspin Road Suite 1, Wilmington Massachusetts, for the purchase of (1) Niton FXL 950 Mining Analyzer (Niton FXL 950). <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.
<p>The Niton FXL 950 will be used for the measurement of a wide range of metals in tobacco samples. The Niton FXL 950 is a medium sized portable X-ray Fluorescence Instrument that is capable of giving the metals value for a wide range of elements at the accuracy required for the DLS's planned experiments. The Niton FXL 950 system can detect 40 critical elements including metals that are carcinogenic (As, Cr, Cd, Cr, Co, Ni), toxic (Pb, AI), biologically active (Cu, Fe, Mo, Zn) and those that act as markers for other ingredients used in tobacco products (Ag, Pd, Si, Mg). The Niton FXL 950 is optimized for the analysis of high Z elements (like Ba, Sb, and Cd) and low Z elements (like Mg, Al, and Si). In addition, the Niton FXL 950 contains a helium purge unit that improves light Z element detection by as much as a factor of 2, or reduces the LOD by 50%. The Niton FXL 950 also has a Geometrically Optimized Large Area Drift Detector (GOLDD) to improve the speed of measurement of all elements. This feature is necessary to help the DLS increase its efficiency and meet its research time-requirements. Thermo Scientific is the sole manufacturer of the Niton FXL 950. Therefore, Thermo Scientific is the only source for this requirement.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Thermo Scientific. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide this equipment to Vallerie Redd VIA EMAIL ONLY at gfj3@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2012-Q-14728 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN July 20, 2012. The Contracting Officer will not respond to verbal requests. All requests must be in writing.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. (3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. <BR> <BR>(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): (i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; (ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment?

(iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost? (A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and (B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. (5) Overpayments/Underpayments.

(t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR)
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <BR> <BR>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor?s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.
 
(End of Clause) <BR> <BR>(a) Inspection/Acceptance. 
(1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.
(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.
(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.
(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to award a non-competitive contract to the National Volunteer Fire Council (NVFC) located at 7852 Walker Drive, Suite 450, Greenbelt, MD 20770.
<p>The United States Fire Administration (USFA), in coordination with fire service organizations has maintained a continuous program of support to disseminate fire-related information to volunteer fire and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) departments throughout the country for nearly two decades.</p>
<p>The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>The purpose of the purchase order is to procure the services to; (1) develop online training and a webinar on Preventing and Coping with Suicide in the Fire and Emergency Services; (2) develop and deliver online training from existing courses and webinars. The training topics include Recruitment and Retention, Managing Change When Transitioning to a Combination Department, and Leadership in the Volunteer Emergency Services. Webinars include Navigating Fire Service Funerals and Obesity in the Fire service; (3) produce a video on Preventing Firefighter Arson and review and develop materials for USFA's Prevention and Public Education Exchange.</p>
<p>The NVFC is the only national organization representing volunteer first responders. Representing 26,000 of the nation's 30,000 fire departments, and more than 800,000 individuals, the NVFC is uniquely positioned to identify, understand, and address the challenges and successes faced by volunteer first responders. From legislative initiatives, funding for fire departments, volunteer retention and recruitment, health and safety issues, and reputation management, the NVFC is leading the charge in serving and advocating for volunteers.</p>

The results of this task will be the foundation for the U.S. Fire Administration's (USFA) 2013 Arson Awareness Week Campaign.</p>
<p>The NVFC has an existing network of State Fire Directors to obtain information and statistics essential for the development of a webinar on Firefighter Suicide. The same is true for the Training, Development and Delivery because the five webinars were developed by the NVFC. The courses that will be developed and offered as online training and webinars are Recruitment and Retention, Managing Change When Transitioning to a Combination Department, Leadership in the volunteer Emergency Services, Navigating Fire Service Funerals and Obesity in the Fire Service.</p>
<p>The contractor must be able to meet core capabilities required for this requirement as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Promote the interests of state and local volunteer fire and EMS organizations at the national level;<br />&bull; Promote and provide education and training for volunteer fire and EMS organizations;<br />&bull; Gather applicable information from and disseminate information to the volunteer fire and EMS organizations from the United States Fire Administration (USFA), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS);<br />&bull; Serve as the voice and advocate for the volunteer fire and EMS organizations in the national arena and provide tools, resources and programs;<br />&bull; Conduct research, develop training, collect information and distribute that information which has an impact on volunteer fire and EMS departments.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Experience with the development and distribution of National Arson Awareness Week Campaign and prevention campaign material;<br />&bull; Existing data on firefighter suicide<br />&bull; Existing mechanism to deliver announcements, information and training to more than 20,000 volunteer fire departments in the United States;<br />&bull; Manage a firefighter arson data base of firefighter arson and case studies;<br />&bull; Experience with the development and delivery of the courses that will be offered as webinars and developed and designed for an online, on-demand forma. The courses are: Recruitment and Retention, Managing Change When Transitioning to a Combination Department, Leadership in the volunteer Emergency Services, Navigating Fire Service Funerals and Obesity in the Fire Service.</p>

<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications demonstrating their ability to provide these services via email to Kim Logue no later than 11:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on <br />July 20, 2012.

<DESC>NASA/LARC has a requirement for a Venable 350c-05 Standard Loop Analysis Testing System and materials. NASA/LARC intends to purchase the items from Venable Industries. Venable is the manufacturer and sole distributor of the required equipment. The equipment is required in order to maintain compatibility and make comparable measurements with existing Venable equipment to share data within the NASA community. It would take substantial duplication of resources and time for another source to provide similar equipment, and this additional expense is not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:30 p.m. local time on 07/10/2012.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Objective:</strong></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The objective of these Contracts is to provide professional communication support for NHTSA Regional Office in Region 6, consisting of the following states:<span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt"> </span>Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and the Indian Nations, to support seat belt and impaired driving program efforts as well as other priority highway safety programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation whose primary mission is to reduce deaths, injuries and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes. This is accomplished by:</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&bull;Setting and enforcing national safety performance standards for motor vehicles and equipment;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&bull;Providing grants to state and local governments to enable them to conduct effective local highway safety programs;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&bull;Marketing and promoting safety messages, campaigns and materials to various audiences aimed at raising awareness and influencing and sustaining positive traffic safety behaviors.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">Research has demonstrated that increasing safety belts and preventing impaired driving is the most effective means to meet NHTSA's core mission.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">NHTSA estimates that increasing safety belts use can reduce crash fatalities by up to 45 percent in cars and 60 percent in light trucks. Every one percent increase in safety belt use translates into 2.8 million more Americans buckled up, 250 additional lives saved and 4,000 fewer serious injuries annually.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">Impaired driving-related deaths account for 42 percent of all traffic fatalities annually. Driving impaired is one of the most often committed crimes in America, affecting 1 in 3 citizens annually, resulting in 1 fatality every 30 minutes, 45 deaths every day and more than 13,000 fatalities annually.</span></p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">Based on ten (10) plus years of research, NHTSA and its partners have determined that conducting traffic enforcement with highly visible publicity and advertising is the most effective way to influence audiences to buckle up and deter impaired driving.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">NHTSA's national communications plan supports the agency's policy and program priorities. High Visibility Enforcement for safety belt use and impaired driving prevention is the cornerstone of the national plan. NHTSA recommends that States and local communities also implement HVE as the foundation of their communications efforts and build around their key enforcement periods. Based on numerous years of experience working at the national and state levels, NHTSA has developed recommendations for communications strategy and tactical plans for state and local partners to effectively promote traffic safety year round.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Arial Unicode MS'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Contract Awards:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong></p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1400 Northpoint Parkway, Suite 50, West Palm Beach, Florida 33407-1976 to procure the following:</p>
<p>1. Easy -nLC II Liquid Chromatograph, Item Number: 10, Material Number: Lc110, Quantity: One (1) Each.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Medical Genetics Branch (MGB) seeks to identify and understand inherited disorders of metabolism and of human development. MGB investigators focus on human genetics, vertebrate embryology, inborn errors of metabolism, and neurogenetic disorders. Projects performed at the biochemical, molecular, and cell biological levels involve the direct study of human subjects as well as the development and use of experimental model systems, such as zebrafish and mouse.<br /><br />The Proxeon Easy Nano-LC instrument is a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system that will be coupled on-line to our existing ThermoElectron LTQ Mass Spectrometer to separate and analyze peptides for proteomics experiments. This HPLC instrument is critical for to keep the mass spectrometry facility running properly. The laboratory performs extensive proteomics and cell biology experiments with various members of the lab. A reliable, efficient instrument is needed to ensure that samples get processed in a timely fashion and collaborators have access to high quality data. It is critical that this instrument is acquired, due to the current Dionex HPLC being used in the Mass Spectrometry facility is not functioning properly, service has been poor for the past several years, and the replacement parts have been discontinued and unavailable since March 2012. The proposed Proxeon Easy Nano-LC instrument is from ThermoElectron, which is the same vendor as the mass spectrometer instrument we are using. The purchase of the Proxeon will&nbsp;enable NHGRI&nbsp;to continue smoothly with research due to the compatibility of existing Thermo Electron system and the new acquired Proxeon.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-58 (May 18, 2012). This requirement is under the SAT of $150,000.00.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, July 9, 2012, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.</p>

<a href="mailto:tharp.scott@epa.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development (ORD) located at 26 W. Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, OH, requires a certified COMSOL consultant to evaluate and debug a COMSOL Finite Element Mathmatics (FEM) model developed by EPA's National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) describing a chemical reaction in a spinning annular region.  A spinning tube-in-tube reactor (STTR) is a continuous-flow reaction system that uses the benefits of increased reaction efficiency and conversion to produce more sustainable processess.  The enhanced performance is believed to be the result of high shear rates (mixing) created within the reaction zone minimizing the heat and mass transfer resistance encountered by the reacting species.  However, quantitative analysis of this phenomenon is limited to ideal cases and is impractical for system design.  Without such a model, experimental work involves a rigorous trial-and-error approach to determ  ine the conditions necessary to carry out a reaction in the STTR and does not guarantee identical performance after scale-up.  The developed model will accurately simulate the simultaneous heat and mass transfer occuring within an STTR to aid in both experimental and process design.  The improved efficiency for experimental and process design that this model will provide is necessary for EPA to meet its deliverables to both industrial partners and to the Chemical Safety for Sustainability (CSS) National Research Program within EPA.  NRMRL has developed a preliminary model using COMSOL Multiphysics and requires expertise not available within the Agency to obtain a solution to the model based on manipulation of the FEM solving parameters for chemical reaction process simulation within COMSOL Multiphysics.  A firm-fixed-price contract will be issued with award being made using best value methodology. This is a Small Business Set-Aside under NAICS Code 541712 with a Size Standard of 500 Employees.  All prospective offerors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration system in order to be eligible for award. See the website www.ccr.gov for information about registration.  It is anticipated that the complete solicitation will be posted on or about July 20, 2012 on the EPA website http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd. It is the responsibility of the offerors to monitor the EPA website for changes or updates. No hard copies will be made available. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered. Point of Contact for this requirement is Scott Tharp, Contracting Officer, at (513) 487-2020, or email at tharp.scott@epa.gov. Questions must be submitted in writing via email.

<DESC>Notice Type:		Presolicitation Notice<br>Title:			Special Operations Forces Requirements Analysis, Prototyping, Training, Operations and Rehearsal III (SOF RAPTOR III)<br><br>Purpose: The purpose of this notice is to alert industry that PEO STRI will soon be issuing a competitive solicitation for the SOF RAPTOR III effort.  Estimated RFP release is late July 2012. <br><br>Brief Summary:  The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Product Manager for Special Operations Forces (SOF) Training Systems (PM STS) will issue an RFP to replace the existing Special Operations Forces Requirements Analysis, Prototyping, Training, Operations and Rehearsal II (SOF RAPTOR II) contract.  SOF RAPTOR II supports numerous efforts in support of the objectives of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and its component commands:  United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWARCOM), Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC), and Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC).  <br><br>Program Description:  PM STS requires a contract vehicle to replace the existing SOF RAPTOR II contract which is close to reaching its ceiling.  The SOF RAPTOR II contract, awarded in April 2009 with a ceiling of $48.9M, is a single award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract vehicle, which replaced the SOF RAPTOR I contract.   The SOF RAPTOR I contract was comprised of efforts that were 100% Engineering Services, whereas the SOF RAPTOR II contract was a mix of Engineering Services and Program Management efforts.  Both contracts were awarded to small businesses.  <br><br>SOF RAPTOR II provides the means for conducting live, virtual and constructive training, services, training requirements analysis, concept exploration, prototyping, advanced concept exploration, rapid prototype development, and operation and maintenance functions to support USSOCOM and its component command training, simulator and simulation requirements.  <br><br>It is expected that SOF RAPTOR III will continue to evolve in the future and is geared towards overall engineering services management rather than engineering services alone.<br><br>Acquisition Strategy: The SOF RAPTOR III competition will be conducted as a Total Small Business Set Aside, utilizing Best Value Trade Off Source Selection procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.101-1. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this effort has been identified as 541330, "Engineering Services", with a size standard of $35M.  <br><br>The SOF RAPTOR III competition will result in a single-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with a ceiling of $97.8M.<br>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">This is a Sources Sought Notice for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).&nbsp; A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. <br /><br />The Government intends to determine through this Sources Sought Notice if there are two (2) or more small businesses that are responsible and capable of carrying out the requisition. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Small business should identify</span>:<br /></strong><br />&bull; The 51% of the work that they will accomplish <br />along with their projected teaming arrangements (GSA Schedule), joint venture, or subcontracting arrangements.<br /><br />&bull; Concerns they have with the sources sought which would preclude them from proposing on the project.<br /><br />The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Contracts Management Division (CMD), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP)/PWS in accordance with FAR PT 12 - ACQUISITION OF COMMERCIAL ITEMS. <br /><br />The Period of Performance is a total of 18 months.<br /><br /><strong><br />DRAFT PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)<br /><br />INTRODUCTION<br /></strong><br />The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) administers the nutrition assistance programs of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The mission of FNS is to provide children and needy families better access to food and a more healthful diet through its nutrition assistance programs. Among these programs are the Child Nutrition Programs, including the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), School Breakfast Program (SBP), Summer Food Service Program (SFSP), and the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP). The Child Nutrition Programs provide nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free meals and snacks. Team Nutrition is an FNS initiative that supports the Child Nutrition Programs through training and technical assistance for foodservice, nutrition education for children and their caregivers, and school and community support for healthy eating and physical activity.<br /><br /><strong>BACKGROUND<br /></strong><br />On January 26, 2012, the USDA issued final regulations that aligned the meal patterns and dietary specifications for school meals with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 (DGAs). Because of the new regulations, children will soon have access to increased fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free and low-fat milk in the school meals. Changes to the meal patterns include:<br /><br />&bull; Use of food-based menu planning approach <br /><br />&bull; Fruits and vegetables offered as two separate food components of the meal pattern<br /><br />&bull; Fruit offered daily at breakfast and lunch <br /><br />&bull; Vegetables offered daily at lunch, and a minimum weekly requirement for the vegetable subgroups identified by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans: dark green, red/orange, legumes, starchy, and "other" vegetables<br /><br />&bull; A substantial increase in whole grains<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;o At least half of the grains offered during the school week in the NSLP must be whole grain-rich beginning school year 2012-2013. (this requirement begins in the SBP in school year 2013-2014)<br /><br />&nbsp; o All grains offered during the week in both the NSLP and SBP must be whole grain-rich beginning school year 2014-2015<br /><br />&bull; Only fat-free (unflavored or flavored) and low-fat (unflavored) milk may be offered<br /><br />&bull; Meals selected by the students must include a fruit or a vegetable <br /><br />The differences between meals offered before and after the new rule will be immediately noticeable, even to those with little day-to-day involvement in school nutrition. For example, a standard elementary school lunch menu today might consist of cheese pizza (with a crust made of refined white flour), peach cobbler, French fries, and chocolate milk. With the new standards in place, a typical meal might instead consist of cheese pizza on a whole grain-rich crust, baked sweet potato fries, grape tomatoes, cinnamon applesauce and fat-free milk.<br /><br />The new meal requirements will be implemented in the NSLP in school year 2012-2013, which begins July 1, 2012. In response to concerns from school food operators about the feasibility of making major changes to both the breakfast and lunch programs in a short time frame, the requirements for the SBP will be implemented gradually, beginning school year 2013-2014 and continuing to be phased-in for several years afterward. These new meal requirements are accompanied by other changes resulting from the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, including the strengthening of local school wellness policies and development of nutrition standards for foods sold outside of the school meal programs.<br /><br />To maximize the impact of changes to foods available at schools, FNS is seeking to develop a social marketing campaign that uses scientifically-based, behaviorally-focused, and motivational messages that encourage children to choose and consume fruits, vegetables, whole-grains, and low-fat or fat-free milk. Many of these foods are under consumed and perceived to be "less popular" among school age children. Some of these foods, such as many dark-green vegetables or whole grain products, may be "new" to children.<br /><br />Team Nutrition's goal is to improve children's lifelong eating and physical activity habits using the principles of the DGAs and MyPlate &lt;www.choosemyplate.gov&gt;. The proposed social marketing campaign will support Team Nutrition's behavior-oriented strategy of "providing multifaceted, integrated nutrition education for children and their parents" and uses the cafeteria (school lunch and breakfast) as a learning environment in which children develop skills in making nutritious food choices from all five food groups for a healthy lifestyle. In keeping with Team Nutrition's philosophy of utilizing multiple communication channels, this campaign will provide linkages to classroom, school cafeteria, community programs and events, media, and home. <br /><br /><strong>TARGET AUDIENCE<br /></strong><br />The social marketing campaign materials developed under this task will be used by elementary and middle schools participating in the NSLP and/or SBP. The campaign materials will include messages and content targeted to school staff, elementary and middle school children (grades K-8), and their caregivers.<br /><br /><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK<br /></strong><strong><br />CLIN 1.</strong> <strong>Develop nutrition education posters for elementary school that encourage children to consume fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and milk at school meals.<br /><br /></strong>The Offeror shall develop four (4) color posters that support the implementation of NSLP and SBP meal pattern requirements by promoting the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free/low-fat milk at lunch and/or breakfast (vegetables are a component of lunch only). The developed posters will be displayed in the school cafeteria and other locations on the school campus where meals are served/sold. All posters should:<br /><br />&bull; Include the Team Nutrition and USDA logos and EEO/civil rights statement, publication date, and FNS number (to be assigned)<br /><br />&bull; Designed to be printed in color<br /><br />&bull; Use text written in English<br /><br />&bull; Be accurate and consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 and MyPlate; messages must be positive<br /><br />&bull; If images of school meals are depicted, the meal must meet current meal pattern requirements<br /><br />&bull; Reflect current practices, settings, food packaging and trays used in elementary school cafeterias, as applicable <br /><br />&bull; Free of misspellings and grammatical errors<br /><br />&bull; Use original illustrations or photographs, as needed, to successfully convey the desired behavior and accurately portray school meals</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Offeror should consider the use of the following FNS Core Nutrition Messages <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/fns/corenutritionmessages/default.htm">http://www.fns.usda.gov/fns/corenutritionmessages/default.htm</a> for 8-10 year old children for the posters and discuss their possible application in their proposal:<br /><br />&bull; Eat smart to play hard. Choose fruits and veggies at meals and snacks.<br /><br />&bull; Fuel up with fruits and veggies. And soar through your day like a rocket ship.<br /><br />&bull; Fuel up with milk at meals. And soar through your day like a rocket ship.<br /><br />The Offeror should also consider the use of relevant Eat Smart. Play Hard. campaign messages and materials <a href="http://teamnutrition.usda.gov/Resources/eatsmartmaterials.html">http://teamnutrition.usda.gov/Resources/eatsmartmaterials.html</a>, also developed and tested with 8-10 year olds, and determine how they may be used, updated, or otherwise utilized. For instance, these messages:<br /><br />&bull; Power up with breakfast.<br /><br />&bull; Balance your day with food and play.<br /><br />While the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 and MyPlate offer consumer messages related to whole grains, FNS does not have any core messages related to whole grains that have been specifically tested with elementary school age children nor have messages focused solely on lunch or breakfast. For this reason, FNS is seeking concept/prototype testing of the posters. Team Nutrition has historically produced posters for schools that are 24" by 36" or 36" by 24" in size. The poster design prototypes should use these dimensions and then the poster should be resized, if needed, based upon feedback from school foodservice directors under CLN 3. The Contractor must also design an envelope mailer to hold the four folded posters. The mailer must include Team Nutrition's return address and the name of the poster series specifying the elementary school audience.<br /><br />The Offeror shall conduct formative research with elementary-school age children to inform the development of the posters (content and illustrations/photography) to ensure that the posters:<br /><br />&bull; communicate messages as intended <br /><br />&bull; communicate information that is understood by the target audience<br /><br />&bull; are memorable and considered motivational by the target audience<br /><br />The Offeror shall propose the method of formative research, including recruitment, segmentation, number of participants, any incentives, analysis of results, and methods to gather feedback from different areas of the country (geographic regions, rural, urban). At least one-third of children should be from low-income households (&lt;185% of poverty). Research participants should reflect the ethnic and racial diversity of elementary school age children nationwide.<br /><br />The method of formative research must gather feedback on poster and message concepts (at least two concepts/prototypes per poster) and evaluative feedback on the final poster designs. The formative research should also gather input from children on how the messages and images on the poster could be used in other ways (for example, on labels of the names of vegetable dishes on the serving line, on printed school menus, etc.).<br /><br />The Offeror shall prepare a draft and final version of data collection request packages for each phase (concept testing, and final poster testing) under FNS' generic clearance to submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that includes instruments to be used and prototypes to be tested (e.g., moderator's guides, the poster prototypes, screeners, etc). The Contractor shall also assist FNS in preparing responses to questions from OMB regarding the data collection (i.e., formative research). <br /><br />The Offeror shall provide copies of the OMB packages to FNS in a microcomputer word processing format agreeable to FNS (currently Microsoft Word 2007 for Windows).<br /><br />The Offeror shall allow four months for OMB approval for each phase, and make changes to the OMB package as required by FNS or OMB.<br /><br />The Offeror shall provide a draft and final report to FNS for each research phase (concept testing and final poster testing) that includes the formative research findings and recommendations for poster revisions and, if applicable, transcripts of any focus group sessions. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Offeror shall provide four drafts and a final deliverable of the posters</span>:<br /><br /></strong>&bull; Draft 1 Poster Concepts and Draft Messages<br /><br />&bull; Draft 2 Formative Research Poster Prototypes (8 prototypes)<br /><br />&bull; Draft 3 Posters in Full Design for Formative Research Testing Phase 2<br />(4 posters)<br /><br />&bull; Draft 4 Dietary Guidelines and Office of Communications Clearance Draft<br /><br />&bull; Final Posters<br /><br />FNS requires that all drafts of the posters be provided as double-spaced Microsoft Word documents and PDF files (regular spacing per curriculum design). FNS will require 10 business days to review drafts. Drafts cleared through the Dietary Guidance Working Group and USDA Office of Communications (OC) requires 30 days for review. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For final deliverables, the Offeror shall</span>: <br /><br /></strong>&bull; Follow specifications from the USDA Office of Communications (OC) and the Broadcast Media and Technology Center, or other USDA OC components, as provided by FNS.<br /><br />&bull; Use cross-platform TrueType fonts.<br /><br />&bull; Verify that poster materials are original and have no existing trademarks or copyrights.<br /><br />&bull; Provide releases that state that FNS owns all work from this procurement and shall have royalty-free rights to the use of any photographs, illustrations, or song lyrics/music used in the curriculum as FNS sees fit. <br /><br />&bull; Provide FNS with electronic files (.PDF other format approved by FNS) of all posters suitable for downloading by the public from the FNS Web site. All deliverables produced, including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities.

<DESC>Introduction: NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is seeking to preserve a unique consolidated inventory of Nondestructive Test and Evaluation (NDE) equipment and capability for current and future mission support.  This Request for Information (RFI) describes this equipment, currently underutilized as a result of the transition from the Space Shuttle Program to the future mission activities authorized by Congress.  NASA KSC seeks to identify potential industry interest in the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of the Hangar N facility and NDE equipment.  NASA KSC is considering entering into partnership agreements for this property in which the potential Partner would, at Partners own expense, operate and maintain the facility and equipment for the term of the Agreements.   NASA KSC is seeking concepts for how the facility and equipment would be used and maintained in order to make the contemplated agreements feasible.  Certain NDE property is affixed to the Hangar N facility and cannot feasibly be relocated.  As a result, NASA KSC would need to implement a real property agreement for Hangar N with the potential Partner. Hangar N O&M would be the responsibility of the potential Partner.   Hanger N and its associated labs are NASA resources located near KSC on the grounds of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS).  Hangar N real property resources were previously used by the Space Shuttle Program.  However, with the end of that program, various KSC facilities, like Hangar N, are now underutilized.  In such cases, NASA has the option of establishing partnerships with external organizations to make beneficial use of such facilities.  Such arrangements must benefit the U.S. Government and NASA.  NASA KSC has developed or is developing other partnerships similar to what is described herein.  Purpose of This RFI: The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential partners and concepts for the operations and maintenance of the Hangar N facility and NDE equipment.  Attachment 1 describes the NDE capabilities of Hangar N. Attachment 2 provides a list of available equipment that collectively constitute the NDE capability for the inspection of space flight hardware, avionics and ground support equipment (GSE) processing, troubleshooting, and failure analysis.  NASA KSC is considering entering into use agreements for these assets. To the extent that NASA enters into use agreements, it will do so via a Space Act Agreement (SAA), consistent with its authority under the Space Act [51 U.S.C. 20101-164].  The Agreements would define the full roles and responsibilities of NASA and the selected Partner.  NASA would maintain the right to terminate the Agreements, in whole or in part, at any time for reasons they deem sufficient. The potential Partner would be fully responsible for the operations and maintenance of the equipment, at their own expense, for the term of any Agreement.  The equipment would remain in Hangar N for the duration of the Agreement. Any portable use of the equipment at other locations would be at the expense of the Partner, and, for property accounting purposes, KSC would need to be informed of any equipment relocation.  The agreement would not exceed five years, but could be subject to extension under specific circumstances.	 Any potential Partner operating in Hangar N shall comply with all rules and regulations for operating a facility on a U.S. military installation.  NASA may establish a Public-Private or Public-Public Venture (PPV) to grant a Partner an interest in real property for a specified term through an instrument such as a lease, a use permit, or other form of property out-grant term authorized by the Space Act. Such ventures are defined as partnering tools in NASAs Real Property Management Program to leverage underutilized Agency real property to maximize utilization and efficiency.  NASA KSC intends to grant the industry Partner sufficient rights to occupy, operate, modify and maintain the facility, as necessary to support the proposed business approach.	It is NASAs intent to ensure fairness to all parties and to ensure best value for the Government in granting use of NASA facilities in a manner that optimizes support for the Agencys missions and objectives.  NASA KSC also seeks to ensure broad awareness and visibility of this opportunity for a PPV between NASA and industry or non-federal public entities.  All categories of domestic entities organized under the laws of the United States or of a State, including U.S. Federal Government Agencies, are eligible to respond to the RFI. NASA will apply and pursue negotiated agreements with a Partner only if deemed in the Governments best interests. NASA reserves the right to proceed with development and negotiation of one or more proposed PPVs or other Partnering and facility utilization agreements with respondents to this announcement, without further notice, if it determines that it has met the purposes, intent, and objectives identified in this announcement. Description of the Offered Resources: NASA KSC is considering entering into agreements with prospective industry Partners for operations and maintenance of the Hangar N facility and the consolidated inventory of Hangar N NDE equipment, as described in Attachments 1 and 2.  NASA  will retain ownership of all real property and equipment in their entirety as part of any use agreements.   Hangar N, Building 1728, is located at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS).  Hangar N Complex is a freestanding/self contained group of buildings which includes the following:  (1) Hangar N (Bldg. 1728), includes 43,062 square feet with 4 separate bays (work areas), a high bay area,	and logistics, (2) Little N (bldg. 54928), including 5,300 square feet,  used for storage, and (3) a 90-day Waste accumulation site.  The Hangar N capabilities have supported multiple programs at KSC, including the Space Shuttle Program.  Hangar N capabilities have included NDE inspection of large structures, staging of hardware and equipment including logistics, and hardware refurbishment.  Bay 1 was used for External Tank Attach ring refurbishment, Bay 2 for load testing, and Bays 3 and 4 for NDE Inspection Activity.  The High Bay features a Robotic X-ray cell, a Paint Booth, Corrosion Booth, and Ovens. Additional areas include an NDE Analysis Room, the former Solid Rocket Motor Pin Refurbishment Room, a Solid Film Lubrication Room, and Conference Room.  Hangar N has the facility infrastructure to provide commodities such as breathing air, compressed air, and gaseous nitrogen, and also includes two 25-ton overhead cranes.  Requested information from respondents to the RFI: NASA KSC seeks information from viable organizations regarding their interest in operating and maintaining the Hangar N facility and the inventory of Hangar N NDE equipment. NASA is specifically requesting the following information: 1.	Company/entity name and address, including a Point of Contact name, phone number and email address. 2.	A description of how the respondent intends to utilize the facility and conduct O&M of NDE equipment. 3.	Identification of current or past Government contracts under which the respondent held contractor-accountable Government property subject to FAR 52.245-1, Government Property. 4.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research.<br /><br />
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.<br /><br />Background<br />The National Information Center on Health Services Research and Health Care Technology (NICHSR) was established by the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-43). A unit of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), NICHSR has the broad mission of improving "...the collection, storage, analysis, retrieval, and dissemination of information on health services research, clinical practice guidelines, and on health care technology, including the assessment of such technology."<br /><br />The overall goals of the NICHSR are: to make the results of health services research, including practice guidelines and technology assessments, readily available to health practitioners, health care administrators, health policy makers, and payers, and the information professionals who serve these groups; to improve access to data and information needed by the creators of health services research; and to contribute to the information infrastructure needed to foster patient record systems that can produce useful health services research data as a by-product of providing health care.<br /><br />Purpose<br />The purpose of this requirement is to obtain specific information to guide direction for future development and enhancement of the NICHSR program by gauging the information needs of target audiences and the awareness of target audiences of NICHSR resources. The results of the evaluation will inform the creation of new products and services as well as the refinement/enhancement of existing products and services, including the redesign of both NICHSR web portals. Specifically, the contractor organization will carry out a project to:<br /><br />Conduct four to eight online focus groups with representatives from target audiences from both the health services research and public health communities, to include: educators/academics/researchers/students; health policy think tanks; federal, state, and local government agencies; health educators, librarians and information specialists.<br /><br />NICHSR needs information about and from its target audiences so that its overall program and curated web collections and resources, databases, tools, training courses and materials can be improved, updated, and developed to meet our target audiences' diverse and dynamic information needs.<br /><br />The health care environment is undergoing tremendous upheaval from political, technological, and market forces. Health services research and public health services and systems research are central to evaluating and interpreting what works, for whom, and under what conditions. New and larger datasets are being constructed and are being made available for the conduct of research. It is important that NICHSR undertake an evaluation of the current needs of its target audiences so that its' program direction is relevant and useful.<br /><br />The evaluation will also give the National Information Center on Health Services Research and Health Care Technology (NICHSR) feedback on its information products and services, including HSR Information Central, its web portal for health services research, and PHPartners, its web portal for public health. It will help facilitate collaborations for creating new products and services that best fulfill the mission of NICHSR. In order to determine how well NICHSR is meeting the information needs and interests of its target audience(s), it is critical that NICHSR obtain feedback from these target groups.<br /><br />It is anticipated that the period of performance will be for a period of seven-months.<br /><br />Vendor Requirements<br />Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, and services needed to complete this project according to the proposed below. All work performed under this procurement shall be monitored by NLM Project Officer.<br /><br />NICHSR proposes to conduct up to four online focus group sessions for its target audience of health services research including representatives from:<br /><br />&bull; Educators/academics, researchers, and students<br />&bull; Think tanks<br />&bull; Federal and state government agencies<br />&bull; Librarians and information specialists<br /><br />NICHSR also proposes to conduct up to four online focus group sessions for its target audience of public health workers including representatives from:<br /><br />&bull; Students/academics<br />&bull; State and local public health workers/program managers and community health center public health workers<br />&bull; Health educators<br />&bull; Librarians and information specialists<br /><br />Each focus group will include five to nine members. There will be at least two but not more than four focus group sessions convened for each target audience (health services research and public health). The number of focus group sessions will be determined once participants have been identified. Ideally, there will be two online focus groups across two different target respondent categories (e.g., two groups of academics and two groups of non-academics).<br /><br />Transcripts of the focus group sessions will be analyzed by the contractor and summarized into findings of overall impressions, specific suggestions for refinement/improvement, and general recommendations from focus group participants.<br /><br />Results will be used to make improvements and refinements to NICHSR products and services, to coordinate development of new HSR and Public Health information products and services, to create a more formal structure and process for web portal and database development, and to help identify collaborations for future products and services.<br /><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disable, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.

Systems Group, 3206 Tower Oaks Boulevard, Suite 300, Rockville, MD 20852, to provide scientific and technical support for research on long-term trends in cloudiness using ground-based and satellite data sources. The primary goal of this research is production and analysis of improved datasets of total cloud cover, low cloud, and other related variables. This work requires the processing and analysis of many large datasets and the expertise of individuals familiar with cloud data. In addition, the contractor must have a Ph.D. and at least 5 years of experience after the degree in the area covered by this announcement. The work done in the first year of the project will be extended to additional datasets, a climate-quality ground-based cloud dataset will be produced, and that dataset will be compared to satellite cloud data. To facilitate this research, the contractor will obtain, process, and analyze additional datasets and participate in writing papers and other scientific communications describing the work, using the contractor's experience and expertise in working with cloud data.<br />Tasks to be performed<br />&bull;Complete development of a climate-quality dataset of total cloud data for the contiguous U.S. using augmented National Weather Service and military weather station data. <br />&bull;Conduct further comparisons between satellite and ground-based cloud time series, using PATMOS-X, ISCCP, and additional satellite cloud products. <br />&bull;Extend cloud data analysis to stations in Alaska, Hawaii and Pacific islands.<br />&bull;Obtain, process and analyze other meteorological data from ground or satellite sources as needed to further the goals of the project. <br />&bull;Provide advice and assistance to other team members on processing and analysis of cloud and other data.<br />&bull;Contribute to writing of papers and preparation of scientific presentations on changes in cloud cover.<br />&bull;Communicate with potential collaborators and sources of data or information as needed to further the goals of the project.<br />&bull;Other duties as needed to accomplish the goals of the project.
<p>Deliverables<br />&bull;Brief monthly reports summarizing work done in the previous month.<br />&bull;Climate-quality monthly mean time series of total cloud cover from augmented NWS and military weather stations for the contiguous U.S.</p>
<p>Schedule:<br />One (8 hour) day per week, to begin immediately and end within two years thereafter, with the second year dependent on the availability of continued funding. The hours shall not exceed a total of 370 per year. The period of performance is for a base period and one (1) option years.<br />I.M. Systems Group. Has more than ten years of experience in climate research. Published numerous papers on trends in ground base cloud data and responsible for processing and analyzing datasets similar to those that are being used in the Air Resources Laboratory's cloud project. They have published at least five papers on other climate topics using surface observations many of which are relevant to this project. I.M. Systems Group has already worked on the first year of this project and so has knowledge and experience that would not be available to another individual. Substituting another scientist for this position would require ARL to spend additional time and effort in training the new company. The government knows of no other company that has scientists with the knowledge base and experience to meet the government's need. Prior market research was performed. Only two contractors have indicated they provided analysis of air quality and meteorological data. However, they did not have expertise in conducting research on long-term trends in cloudiness using ground-based and satellite data sources noted in this requirement.</p>
<p>Firms who believe they can provide these services that will meet all the requirements specified herein, must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide the service and satisfy the Government's needs. In addition shall include name, telephone number and address of concerns for which you have furnished this type of services previously. Interested parties must respond within ten (10) calendar days after publication of this notice. If no affirmative responses are received, the government intends to issue a purchase order to I.M. Systems Group. The Eastern Region Administrative Division (ERAD), requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/. In order to register with the CCR offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505.

The placement cross section will be a berm at elevation +8.5 ft NAVD, at an average width of 150 ft from the existing +8.5 ft NAVD beach profile contour, then sloping seaward at 1 ft vertical to 15 ft horizontal to the existing beach profile. Payment will be based on the placement template, not on the dredged quantity as this is a storm damage reduction feature.<br>Optional Work:<br>All volumes are based on availability of material from the Shinnecock Navigation Channel and Deposition Basin.<br><br>Option 1.  Placement of material dredged from Shinnecock Inlet Navigation Channel and Deposition Basin will be placed at the Atlantic Ocean Beach at Tiana Beach, at an approximate distance of 9,200 to 8,000 ft from the west jetty.  An approximate total of 130,000 cubic yards of material will be placed in this area, in a berm and stockpile feature.  The berm will be placed at +8.5 ft NAVD and will be used as the base for the stockpile feature.  The stockpile will not exceed 40,000 cubic yards, placed on newly created berm and will not be higher than +18.5 ft NAVD. Payment for this area will be paid by dredged quantity, as this is an inlet sediment bypassing feature.<br><br>Option 2.  Placement of material dredged from Shinnecock Inlet Navigation Channel and Deposition Basin will be placed at the Atlantic Ocean Beach at Shinnecock Inlet County Park, widening the Base Project berm and adding a stockpile feature.  Approximately 175,000 cubic yards of material will be placed in this area, in a berm and stockpile feature.  The berm will be placed at +8.5 ft NAVD seaward of the Base Project berm, and will be longer alongshore than the Base Project berm (approximately 800 to 1000 ft longer).  The stockpile will not exceed 50,000 cubic yards, and will not be higher than +18.5 ft NAVD. Payment for this area will be paid by dredged quantity, as this is an inlet sediment bypassing feature.<br><br>Option 3.  Placement of material dredged from Shinnecock Inlet Navigation Channel and Deposition Basin will be placed at the Atlantic Ocean Beach at Shinnecock Inlet County Park, widening the Base Project berm.  Approximately 175,000 cubic yards of material will be placed in this area, in a berm feature.  The berm will be placed at +8.5 ft NAVD seaward of the Base Project berm then sloping seaward at 1 ft vertical to 15 ft horizontal to the existing beach profile, and will be longer alongshore than the Base Project berm (approximately 500 to 1000 ft longer).

		APPENDIX 1: Purpose and Objectives 

The replacement of the OR Intercom System at the Bay Pines VAHCS operating room suite, 2nd floor, building 100, Bay Pines FL. The current clinic has 9 operating rooms. This system is about 25 years old and drops out periodically for reasons unknown and we have no parts to repair it. Replacement of this equipment is warranted given its usage and age. The stations and central equipment will be replaced and the existing wiring and back boxes will be reused. Except for the addition of one station, this is simply a Stentofon equipment upgrade from the old system called Pamex MPC to a new system called Alpacom E7. The equipment requested is 9 OR wall stations, 4 Wall Masters, 1 Wall Sub Master, 6 Desk Masters, 1 Page Adapter, and 6 Receptacles plus labor for installation.

A vendor used to replace the existing system should have the following important specifications: must utilize existing back boxes; must utilize existing conduit and wiring; must be bi-directional; must cover all existing locations; must allow the master location to remain unchanged; must be able to do work on the system only after normal business hours and on weekends. The best possible solution that will disturb patient care the least is to have the current system replaced by newer equipment from the same manufacturer who will re-use the existing wiring. Using this method to resolve the issues with the intercom system will aid in reducing the length of time the project will take making it a less patient and clinician disruptive process. Our healthcare providers can serve our patients better with less disruptions, this is especially true in high risk areas such as our surgical suite. This solution is also more cost effective than alternative solutions in that existing back boxes, wiring, and conduit will be reused which relieves us of having to purchase these components and the labor to install them.

Standardization on equipment exactly as now used, or similar in use, is a matter of patient safety and costs. If physicians, nurses, and technicians are able to use the same or similar systems, when practically possible, they can eliminate any learning curves associated with using new systems which reduces delay in normal patient care.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Purchased Care at the Health Administration Center

Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) Switch

Date: July 5, 2012 
TAC-12-05107
PWS Version Number:  6.8

 
 
1.0 	BACKGROUND
The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Information & Technology (OIT), is to provide benefits and services to Veterans of the United States.  In meeting these goals, OIT strives to provide high quality, effective, and efficient Information Technology (IT) services to those responsible for providing care to the Veterans at the point-of-care as well as throughout all the points of the Veterans' health care in an effective, timely and compassionate manner.  VA depends on Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) systems to meet mission goals. The Health Administration Center (HAC) is the responsible entity within the Chief Business Office (CBO) Purchased Care (PC) for providing effective administration of the following Veterans Health Administration (VHA) fee-for-service health benefit plans:  
"	Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) 
"	Spina Bifida Health Care Program (SB)
"	Children of Women Vietnam Veterans Health Care Program (CWVV)
"	Foreign Medical Program (FMP) 

With the exception of FMP, these are benefit programs for the spouse or surviving spouse and dependents of a qualifying Veteran sponsor.  For all of these programs, HAC is responsible for managing and performing program policy, eligibility determinations, enrollment, contact management, claims processing and status reporting, accounts payable (claims payment), accounts receivable (recoupments), program integrity, and other related processes for the above benefit plans. 

Beyond these factors lies the need for VHA to standardize, streamline and automate its business practices and processes across its organizational entities and within its organizational entities, for example, within the Private Branch Exchange (PBX) functional arena.  This translates into enhanced Veteran/Dependent service by: providing robust Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems that are connected to the growing nexus of information interfaces such as secure chat, call recording and work force management to speed up and automate answers to common customer service questions; and facilitating the creation of a uniform, consistent, and efficient look and feel to customer relationship management that provides redundancy and continuity of operations across the organization. This implementation also supports VA's solution for call center agents and other employees to telework. The solution will be installed by the Contractor at the Health Administration Center (HAC) located at 3773 Cherry Creek North Drive, Denver, CO 80209.

<CONTACT>
<DESC>Posted Date:  July 5, 2012 Procurement Office: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Superfund RCRA  Procurement Operations Division (3805R) 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20460 
Response Date: July 11, 2012 
In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research  and Development  and EPA?s Office of Emergency Management (OEM),  intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order to Beckman Coulter, Inc. for the renewal of a preventative maintenance agreement for the Optima L-100Xp  ultracentrifuge from Beckman Coulter, Inc..
The Beckman Coulter, Inc. Optima L-100XP ultracentrifuge is a specialized centrifuge optimized for spinning a rotor at very high speeds, capable of generating acceleration as high as 100,000 rpm.  This instrument has important uses in EPA's biological research for pelleting of fine particulate fractions, such as cellular organelles, proteins, and viruses.  More specifically, the Optima L-100XP is a critical instrument used in many of EPA's virus occurrence methods and protein purification protocols.  It is important that the ultracentrifuge be in proper functioning order to conduct our virus and protein research.  In addition, the tremendous rotational kinetic energy of a rotor in an operating ultracentrifuge makes the catastrophic failure of a spinning rotor a very serious concern.  The stresses of routine use can eventually cause the equipment to deteriorate.  Therefore, careful maintenance of the ultracentrifuge is required for safe operation and execution of EPA's researc h; this maintenance must be performed by trained specialists.  Because the Optima L-100XP ultracentrifuge is manufactured by Beckman Coulter, Inc., this company is uniquely qualified to service and maintain our ultracentrifuge.  The  ultracentrifuge was  previously maintained  under purchase order EP-11-D000488.  In order to successfully maintain the ultracentrifuge,  it is highly preferable to use Beckman Coulter inc. for the continuation of ,maintenance of the Ultracentrifuge.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, which if received within five (5) calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. 
All questions should be directed to Ron Bell  via the e-mail link below.

The Government's obligation for performance of this contract beyond that date is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise for performance under this contract beyond 30 Sep 2012, until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for performance and until the Contractor receives notice of availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>This is a Brand Name or Equal requirement. Any Or Equal proposal received will be sent to the technical advisor for compatibility or functionality. The Government also reserves the right to make no award at all.</p>
<p>The following salient characteristics MUST be met when submitting an "or equal":</p>
<p>USSOCOM personnel must use legitimate web applications, click links, and use other online media products without putting the network at risk from websites with malicious code, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications, Instant Messaging (IM), or inappropriate content.</p>
<p>USSOCOM requires the capability to maintain and sustain current operational capabilities to support forensic analysis and operational security (OPSEC) analysis requirements for all networks and devices within their architecture. USSOCOM networks' defense-in-depth requirements, as directed by CJCS 6510.01D, Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense (CND), support the warfighter in the global war on terrorism by providing a secure transport of data to and from worldwide locations. One of the aspects of this requirement is to provide URL filtering of web data that is transported or resides on our networks. URL filtering identifies certain types of websites, such as, known malicious sites and sites that display inappropriate or pornographic materials, and allows or blocks access to the sites based on predefined URL categories. This type of software is already in use on the USSOCOM network and needs to be renewed.</p>
<p>Proposed solution for USSOCOM must:<br />Utilize a database that is the result of a network of technology and human intelligence that creates an adaptive feedback network that uses more than 50 million real-time data collecting systems to parse one billion pieces of content daily. This allows the URL filtering software to provide the most advanced content classification, data identification, and security filtering available to mitigate risks to USSOCOM data and productivity. This adaptive feedback network should leverage a host of advanced analytics including rules, signatures, heuristics, behavior analysis, Web reputation services, and URL categories.</p>
<p>The command is requesting 4500 licenses be renewed.</p>
<p>Any or equal product that is proposed for this solution should include up front costs that have already been incurred with Websense.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-58 effective 18 May 2012, DFAR DCN 20120615, and AFFAR AFAC 2012-0330.

The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is 7379, Computer Related Services, Not Elsewhere Classified. A firm fixed price contract will be awarded. All interested parties must bid on all items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement - Offeror must describe how the proposed solution meets or exceeds ALL capabilities in the attached document. Failure to do so will result in the offer being considered non-responsive.</p>
<p>(ii) price;</p>
<p>(iii) past performance (see FAR 15.304); - offeror shall provide 3 recent and relevant references (recent = within the past 5 years, relevant = similar to this effort in size and scope)</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are more important, when compared to price</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.

The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen Mr Gregory S.

<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com).</p>
<p>Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form".</p>

<p>MSC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (APR 2012)</p>
<p>To implement DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (MAR 2008), Military Sealift Command (MSC) utilizes Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) to electronically process vendor requests for payment. This application allows DoD vendors to submit and track Invoices and Receipt/Acceptance documents, if applicable, electronically.</p>
<p>The Contractor is required to utilize this system when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable, under this contract/order, unless an exception at DFARS 252.232-7003(c) applies. The Contractor shall:</p>
<p>(i) ensure an Electronic Business Point of Contact is designated in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov. <br />(ii) register to use WAWF at the https://wawf.eb.mil site, within ten (10) calendar days after award of this contract or modification. Step by step procedures to register are available at the https://wawf.eb.mil site.<br />(iii) ensure review of the MSC WAWF Vendor Guide, available at the MSC site http://www.procurement.msc.navy.mil under the references section.</p>
<p>In the event you have WAWF questions, contact the MSC WAWF point of contact (POC) at MSCHQ_WAWF@navy.mil.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC identified above is for WAWF issues only. Any other contracting questions/problems should be addressed to the Contracting Officer or other person identified in the contract to who questions are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Contractor is directed to use the Commercial Invoice format when processing invoices and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>0 This contract/order DOES require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor IS required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>1 This contract/order does NOT require submission of Material Inspection and Receiving Reports (MIRR) DFARS Clause 252.246-7000; therefore, the vendor is NOT required to process receiving reports in WAWF under this contract/order.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table below is for WAWF purposes only. If any information included in these instructions, e.g., Ship to DoDAAC, contradicts information elsewhere in this contract, those other terms shall take precedence for any matter other than invoicing and receiving reports, if applicable.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the following DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table below. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated below with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>WAWF Routing Table <br />Contract Number To Be Determined<br />Delivery Order To Be Determined<br />Cage Code/Ext To Be Determined<br />Pay DoDAAC N40442<br />Issue Date To Be Determined<br />Admin By DoDAAC N40442<br />Issued By DoDAAC N40442<br />Ship To Code/Ext N62387<br />Ship From Code/Ext Leave Blank<br />LPO DoDAAC Leave Blank<br />Acceptor Email Address Leave Blank<br />Inspect By DoDAAC/Ext Leave Blank</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table above. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the acceptor's/receiver's email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>Past Performance: The offeror shall provide past performance information regarding relevant contracts over the past five (5) years with Federal, state, or local governments, or commercial customers. If the offeror intends to subcontract with another firm(s) for part of this requirement, that firm's past performance information shall also be provided. If the offeror has no relevant past performance, it may include a statement to that effect in its quotation. The government reserves the right to consider data obtained from sources other than those described by the offeror in its quotation. It is recommended that approximately 3-5 contracts be referenced.</p>
<p>The description of each contract/order described in this section shall not exceed one half page in length. For each contract/order, the offeror shall provide the following information:<br />1. Contract number;<br />2. Description and relevance to solicitation requirements including dollar value;<br />3. Period of Performance - indicate by month and year the state and completion (or "ongoing") dates for the contract;<br />4.

Problems Encountered - include information regarding information regarding any problems encountered on the contracts described above and corrective actions taken to resolve those problems.<br />Acceptance of Terms and Conditions: This is an open-market solicitation for equipment as defined herein. The Government intends to award a Purchase Order as a result of this solicitation that will include the clauses set forth herein. The quotation should include one of the following statements:</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document without modification, deletion, or addition."</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>"The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:</p>
<p>Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)</p>
<p>Note: This procurement is not being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If an offeror submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the offeror's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation.</p>
<p><br />QUOTATION EVALUATION:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the offeror whose quotation offers the best value to the Government price and other factors considered. The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Experience, 3) Past Performance, and 4) Price. All non-price factors, when combined, are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p><br />Technical Capability: No prototypes, demonstration models, used or refurbished instruments will be considered. Evaluation of technical capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate that their proposed equipment exceeds NIST's requirements.</p>
<p>Stronger Preference:</p>
<p>Under the Technical Capability factor, stronger preference will be given to:</p>
<p>&bull; Dedicated system that can support 2-port RF measurement results up to 67 GHz, on up to 200mm wafers in +25&deg;C to +200&deg;C temperature range. Stronger preference will be given to systems that exceed this frequency and temperature ranges.<br />&bull; Platen contact-separation drive with +/- 1 micron repeatability (with automated compensation for possible variation in the load standard frequency response). Stronger preference will be given to systems that exceed this separation range.</p>
<p>&bull; Dedicated stereo zoom microscope capable of probe placement pads as small as 25 &mu;m x 35 &mu;m. Stronger preference will be given to systems that exceed this resolution range.</p>
<p>Experience: NIST will evaluate the extent of the offeror's experience providing similar equipment. NIST will give preference to offerors who demonstrate they have experience delivering the same equipment they are proposing for the current requirement. <br />Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>Past Performance, Experience, and Price shall not be evaluated on quotes that are determined technically unacceptable under the Technical Capability Evaluation factor.</p>

Using this process, employees upload each request to a dedicated, secure website by completing a simple form. Within minutes, a phone call is received from a service representative to confirm details, after which the document is distributed. For media advisories, there is an option to exclude from the distribution any sites that can be viewed by the general public. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCOPE OF WORK</span></strong>: <strong>1).

<p>Offerors are encouraged to quote their best price for this service plan.<br />USUHS is a Department of Defense (DoD) Agency and is tax exempt. A copy of our tax exemption certificate will be provided to the selected offeror. Do not include taxes in your quoted price.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a single firm-fixed priced (FFP) purchase order to the offeror representing the best value to the Government based on the evaluation factors listed below. Evaluation factors are listed in order of importance, with most important listed first. The Government will conduct a trade-off between price and non-price factors. The Government is not required to award to the lowest priced offeror or the offeror quoting the highest technically rated item.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors (Listed in order of importance):</p>
<p>&bull; Technical Approach - Offerors are required to submit their technical approach to meeting the requirements outlined in the statement of work. Offerors must display a clear understanding of the requirements. Quotes submitted by offerors who fail to demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirement will not be considered further.</p>
<p>Quotes submitted by offerors that include the following statement, or similar, without any supporting information, may be determined to not have a clear understanding of the requirement and may not be considered:</p>
<p>"The offeror understands the requirements and the submitted quote has met all stated objectives."</p>
<p>&bull; Corporate Experience: Offerors are required to provide a narrative of their corporate experience in providing maintenance support on Leica microscopes or other similar laboratory equipment.</p>
<p>&bull; Past Performance: The Government shall evaluate the offeror's present and past performance on similar tasks within the past three years. Offerors must provide two (2) customer references for similar work performed. The Government reserves the right to select which reference(s) to contact. The following must be provided for each listed reference:<br />a. Name of client and address<br />b. Name of current point of contact including telephone number , e-mail address and title<br />c. Contract number<br />d. Contract value<br />e. Contract period of performance<br />f. A clear description of the supplies/services provided</p>
<p>USU may request additional information at any time.<br />Offerors will have an opportunity to address any adverse past performance history. Offerors who do not have any past performance history will not be rated favorably or unfavorably, but will instead receive a Neutral/Unknown rating for past performance. Offerors must clearly state in their quote if they do not have at least two (2) past performance references. Failure to provide this information may render an offeror's quote non-responsive and may not be considered for award.</p>
<p>A strong history of relevant past performance may be more advantageous to the Government than a less relevant record of favorable performance. The Government reserves the right to use data provided by the offeror and data provided by alternative sources in conducting its assessment of past performance history.</p>
<p>&bull; Price: Price - Offerors must include all applicable costs (Example: Components, Shipping) in their quote. The total quoted price for all components, inclusive of options, will be the evaluated price.<br />Interested offerors are to provide pricing for the following:<br />CLIN 0001 - Annual Service Maintenance (Base Year)<br />CLIN 1001 [OPTION] - Annual Service Maintenance (Option Year 1)<br />CLIN 2001 [OPTION] - Annual Service Maintenance (Option Year 2)<br />CLIN 3001 [OPTION] - Annual Service Maintenance (Option Year 3)</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate quotes received by adding the total price for the base year and all options. Evaluation of the option year pricing does not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p><br />Quotes are due on or before 10:00pm EST on Saturday, 9 June 2012. Quotes shall be submitted via email to the Contract Specialist, Alphonso Simmons, at alphonso.simmons@usuhs.edu and Contract Specialist, Pierre Smith at pierre.smith@usuhs.edu.

<p><br />Justification for other than full and open competition</p>
<p>(1) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity</p>
<p>USCG C3CEN (Command &amp; Control Engineering Center) located in Portsmouth, VA.</p>
<p>(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>SA-850/1A Sound Signal to be used as spares.</p>
<p>(3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs</p>
<p>C2CEN was designated the System Development Agent (SDA) for SRAN/ATON Fog Horns. In order to carry out SDA duties, the existing SA-850 Fog Horns installed at Coast Guard Aids are no longer built by the Manufacture. Buying the last two sound signals as spare to support those that are currently in Coast Guard inventory.</p>
<p>SA-850/1A Sound Signal (Complete), P/N1000-3203, 2 EA</p>
<p>(4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>6.302-1 (2) (ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components there, of, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.</p>
<p>(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.<br />Automatic Power is the sole manufacturer of the SA-850 Fog horn sound device, including repair parts and does not sell this item through distributors. In addition, SA-850 Sound Signal employs control interface circuitry which is compatible with other SRAN product line equipment (i.e. fog detectors, Audio Visual Controllers, etc.) used by the USCG that controls the other sound signals. All centralized training performed at the National Aids to Navigation (NATON) School is taught on sound signals supplied by API. Their sound signals are listed in COMDTINST M16500.3A, Aids to Navigation Manual-Technical as the standard signals used at solar powered and commercially powered lights. In addition to centralized training, the components are repaired at our Engineering Logistics Center (ELC) Laboratory under a mandatory turn-in program. The SA-850 operates in Extreme surf conditions that are better suited to offshore platforms.</p>
<p>(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.<br /><br />A solicitation is to be posted on FEDBIZOPPS</p>
<p>(7) A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Cost to replace all SA-850 horns in the system plus redoing all ATON training will be $3,300,000</p>
<p>(8) A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.</p>
<p>Market research of &frac12; to 1 mile sound signals reveals multiple sources, but none of them meet the standardization requirements set forth in COMDTINST M16500.3A, the low operating frequency of the SA-850 to prevent noise complaints, compatible with the standard parts repaired at the ELC Lab and similar enough that teachings at the NATON School apply to their products. The API SA-850 sound signal uses components manufactured by them, or specially made for them by outside sources. Drawings detailing construction, tolerances and setup are proprietary to API. No other vendor sells the SA-850 sound signal as API is the only known source. Award to another vendor for a signal other than the SA-850 will result in substantial duplication of costs to the Coast Guard for training and support.</p>
<p>(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:</p>
<p>(i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. <br />(ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived. Based on the costs to completely replace the SA-850, around the Coast Guard. $200,000 would be cost to replace and an additional $500,000 to redo the existing Coast Guard Training Plan for a total of $800,000.</p>
<p>(10) A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in <br />the acquisition.</p>
<p>None at this time</p>
<p>(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or <br />overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition <br />for the supplies or services required.</p>
<p>None at this time</p>
<p>(12) Contracting officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>
<p><br />James A. Lassiter<br />Contracting Officer</p>
<p><br />(13) Evidence that any supporting data that is the responsibility of technical or requirements personnel.</p>
<p>I certify this procurement meets the Governments minimum need and<br />the supporting data which forms a basis for this justification, is <br />complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Government's obligation for performance of this contract beyond that date is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise for performance under this contract beyond 30 Sep 2012, until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for performance and until the Contractor receives notice of availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>This is a Brand Name or Equal requirement. Any Or Equal proposal received will be sent to the technical advisor for compatibility or functionality. The Government also reserves the right to make no award at all.</p>
<p>The following salient characteristics MUST be met when submitting an "or equal":</p>
<p>USSOCOM personnel must use legitimate web applications, click links, and use other online media products without putting the network at risk from websites with malicious code, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications, Instant Messaging (IM), or inappropriate content.</p>
<p>USSOCOM requires the capability to maintain and sustain current operational capabilities to support forensic analysis and operational security (OPSEC) analysis requirements for all networks and devices within their architecture. USSOCOM networks' defense-in-depth requirements, as directed by CJCS 6510.01D, Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense (CND), support the warfighter in the global war on terrorism by providing a secure transport of data to and from worldwide locations. One of the aspects of this requirement is to provide URL filtering of web data that is transported or resides on our networks. URL filtering identifies certain types of websites, such as, known malicious sites and sites that display inappropriate or pornographic materials, and allows or blocks access to the sites based on predefined URL categories. This type of software is already in use on the USSOCOM network and needs to be renewed.</p>
<p>Proposed solution for USSOCOM must:<br />Utilize a database that is the result of a network of technology and human intelligence that creates an adaptive feedback network that uses more than 50 million real-time data collecting systems to parse one billion pieces of content daily. This allows the URL filtering software to provide the most advanced content classification, data identification, and security filtering available to mitigate risks to USSOCOM data and productivity. This adaptive feedback network should leverage a host of advanced analytics including rules, signatures, heuristics, behavior analysis, Web reputation services, and URL categories.</p>
<p>The command is requesting 4500 licenses be renewed.</p>
<p>Any or equal product that is proposed for this solution should include up front costs that have already been incurred with Websense.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-58 effective 18 May 2012, DFAR DCN 20120615, and AFFAR AFAC 2012-0330. The North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) is 541519, Other Computer Related Services. The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is 7379, Computer Related Services, Not Elsewhere Classified. A firm fixed price contract will be awarded. All interested parties must bid on all items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement - Offeror must describe how the proposed solution meets or exceeds ALL capabilities in the attached document. Failure to do so will result in the offer being considered non-responsive.</p>
<p>(ii) price;</p>
<p>(iii) past performance (see FAR 15.304); - offeror shall provide 3 recent and relevant references (recent = within the past 5 years, relevant = similar to this effort in size and scope)</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are more important, when compared to price</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT #3:
The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions and reports as identified below: 
1. Due to technical difficulties, Maps, the current Wetland Delineation Report (July 2006), and the current Final Environmental Assessment Report (July 2008) cannot be uploaded via FedBizOpps.gov for interested parties to download. THEREFORE, ALL INTERESTED PARTIES SHALL SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED DOCUMENTS WITH THEIR MAILING ADDRESS VIA EMAIL TO JODI.ZACHARY@BIA.GOV. ALL SHIPMENTS WILL BE MADE VIA FEDEX. 
2. The following are answers to various questions received:
(A) The "Date of Award" is listed as 2/28/13. Since most of the deadlines in the tentative schedule are for 2012, I assume the listed date of award is not correct? You have incorrectly interpreted this line. The "PROPOSED CONTRACT PERIOD" is from the "Date of award" through "2/28/13".
(B) Has the 2006 wetland delineation been verified by the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE)? Typically a verified wetland delineation is valid for a period of five years, after which time it must be re-verified.  Given that the existing delineations were done five to six years ago, will the ACOE consider them valid for the purposes of permitting the dam reconstruction project, or will they need to be updated and reverified?  Re-Verifying and updating the Delineation report is included in the scope for this requirement see the Introduction, Item 2 and Scope of Work and Schedule, Task #2.  The focus locations are the immediate downstream area of Lauer Dam and BIA is in the process of identifying new borrow areas X-L Ranch Reservation.
(C) Have cultural resource consultations been completed for the dam replacement, access road, and borrow areas?  Cultural resource consultations were completed for the dam and access road. BIA is currently working on them for the borrow area.
(D) Have Section 7 consultations with the US Fish and Wildlife Service been completed, and did the consultation include the dam replacement, access road, and borrow areas?  Section 7 consultations with the US Fish and Wildlife Service were completed for the dam and access road. BIA is currently working on them for the borrow area.
(E) Is the project entirely on federal and/or tribal lands? If so we assume that no additional state permits such as a Section 1600 Streambed Alteration Agreement from the California Department of Fish and Game will be required.  The project is entirely on Federal and tribal lands.
4. All other terms and conditions of this combined synopsis/solicitation remain unchanged

<DESC><p>Q: Do you have a load schedule (what are the wattages on each of the 59 zones)?<br />A: We do not have a definitive load schedule for this application and do not feel that it will be required for this initial outfitting. We will take a very simple approach with the initial outfitting. Essentially wanting to put the existing circuits on relay control from a lighting control system that meets the requirements we are looking for. We understand the requested product will be more capable then what is currently required. This is intentional so that we do not waste time and money when we retro-commission the lighting system with LED technology.</p>
<p><br />Q: Do you have a schedule of occupancy sensors? There are none marked on the drawings.<br />A: It would not be prudent for the user to set this schedule, its layout scheme could be very different for the various products available on the market today.</p>
<p><br />Q: All fixtures on the drawings are marked fluorescent. A number of the questions reference LED lighting. Which fixtures are fluorescent? Which are LED?<br />A: All fixtures are currently florescent, but as ballast fail or funding permits we will be changing them out to LED.</p>
<p>Q: Are all of the fixtures dimmable? Which dimming technology?<br />A: None of the current fixtures are dimmable.</p>
<p><br />Q: There are no daylight sensors listed on the drawings. They are required for required daylight harvesting. Please identify a number of sensors.<br />A: It would not be prudent for the user to set this schedule, its layout scheme could be very different for the various products available on the market today.</p>
<p><br />Q: Do you require a phase loss sensor at your installation?<br />A: No phase loss sensor is required</p>
<p><br />Q: What is the number of lamps per fixture? Are the 4' fluorescent tubes 32w T8 lamps.<br />A: All of the hallway fixtures are 2 lamp and the room fixtures are 3 lamp units. All are 32W T8</p>

Evaluation factors are listed in order of importance, with most important listed first. The Government will conduct a trade-off between price and non-price factors. The Government is not required to award to the lowest priced offeror or the offeror quoting the highest technically rated item.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors (Listed in order of importance):</p>
<p>&bull; Technical Approach - Offerors are required to submit their technical approach to meeting the requirements outlined in the statement of work. Offerors must display a clear understanding of the requirements. Quotes submitted by offerors who fail to demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirement will not be considered further.</p>
<p>Quotes submitted by offerors that include the following statement, or similar, without any supporting information, may be determined to not have a clear understanding of the requirement and may not be considered:</p>
<p>"The offeror understands the requirements and the submitted quote has met all stated objectives."</p>
<p>&bull; Corporate Experience: Offerors are required to provide a narrative of their corporate experience in providing maintenance support on Leica microscopes or other similar laboratory equipment.</p>
<p>&bull; Past Performance: The Government shall evaluate the offeror's present and past performance on similar tasks within the past three years.

Offerors must clearly state in their quote if they do not have at least two (2) past performance references. Failure to provide this information may render an offeror's quote non-responsive and may not be considered for award.</p>
<p>A strong history of relevant past performance may be more advantageous to the Government than a less relevant record of favorable performance. The Government reserves the right to use data provided by the offeror and data provided by alternative sources in conducting its assessment of past performance history.</p>
<p>&bull; Price: Price - Offerors must include all applicable costs (Example: Components, Shipping) in their quote.

<p>The Government will evaluate quotes received by adding the total price for the base year and all options. Evaluation of the option year pricing does not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>

<p>The contractor shall construct a wall that delineates the grass from the beach area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It will vary in height from approximately 8 inches to two and a half feet in height matching the slope of the landscape. The wall shall be constructed of Buff colored Interlock Stackstone type landscape block or equivalent (see below), and will be approximately 150 ft in length with stone steps including a metal handrail formed in the center. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The wall will be capped with capping block.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The wall will be constructed approximately 10 <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>feet (+/- 1 foot) inland from the existing wall as measured from the beach side, in order to create more beach area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The block shall be installed so that the inside edge of the top block is flush with the upward slope. Installation of the wall will follow the manufacturer's recommendations. Type and color of block must be included in the contractors offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The existing accessible path will remain in place and will need to be properly protected during construction.

<p><br />2. The sixth paragraph is changed to read as follows:</p>
<p>The Government is restricting one award per line item, for a total of up to three awards. If an award is made, Line Item 1 will be awarded to a single small business concern. If (an) award(s) is/are made, Line Items 2 and 3 will be awarded to a single offeror or multiple offerors.

<p><br />Project Title: "National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation (NHM&amp;E) Service Center"</p>
<p>1. Introduction.</p>
<p>This is a Pre-solicitation Notice for a&nbsp;TOTLA SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE&nbsp;under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541519 "Other Computer Related Services", with size standard of $25 Million. When released the solicitation number will be 2012-N-14314. The solicitation Request for Proposal (RFP) will be made available on the Internet at http://www.fbo.gov on or about June 4, 2012. Request for Proposals will not be provided to interested parties in hard copy form. Telephone requests will not be honored. Interested parties are responsible for checking the website regularly for the release of the RFP and for other procurement-related documents. The information provided in this pre-solicitation is for information purposes only. If there are any differences in the information provided here and the actual solicitation, the information provided in the actual solicitation shall govern.</p>
<p>2. Overview:</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP), Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP), Clinical Epidemiology Branch, is contemplating a single award for one Base Year and four 12 -Months option periods for this project.</p>
<p>3. Purpose:</p>
<p>The objectives of this project are: <br />1. To assist HIV prevention grantees and stakeholders in collecting and reporting NHM&amp;E data by providing technical support via e-mail, telephone, and other media.<br />2. To respond to questions and concerns related to NHM&amp;E and data reporting from grantees and other stakeholders with accurate and consistent responses.<br />3. To assist PEB staff in communicating with, training, or providing technical support to grantees.<br />4. To identify and triage questions about M&amp;E requirements.<br />5. To identify grantees that need enhanced or specialized technical assistance through technical assistance provision mechanisms.<br />6. To triage requests for NHM&amp;E training and resources developed or provided by others, information on data security, and related questions.<br />7. To promote and assist with the use of M&amp;E data by grantees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />4. Objectives: This is a contract for work of providing technical and programmatic support to grantees collecting and reporting the National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation (NHM&amp;E) data, some of whom are using CDC-provided software, to CDC. Implementation, modification, and reporting of NHM&amp;E data will continue during the period covered by this project, so continuing assistance to grantees is essential.</p>
<p>5. Background for the Acquisition. In 2004, CDC responded to the need for more accurate and timely data for monitoring HIV prevention programs by developing and implementing the National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation (NHM&amp;E) [formerly known as the Program Evaluation and Monitoring System (PEMS) variables]. NHM&amp;E is a national set of standardized HIV prevention data variables. To assist in the collection and reporting of the NHM&amp;E data, CDC designed and provided optional, secure web-based software for data entry and management and a range of data collection training and software implementation support services. CDC is now in the midst of a multi-year process of transitioning to another, yet-to-be-determined data collection and reporting software system or systems. NHM&amp;E data variables are also being revised, with the revisions going into effect in 2012. Data will include client-level demographics and HIV risk behaviors, community-level intervention data, structural intervention information, syringe exchange information and bio-medical intervention data. Collection of these variables allows for more detailed and comprehensive reporting of HIV prevention activities including fiscal information, client service data, and data required for calculating the program performance indicators. NHM&amp;E data collection and reporting is required of 69 health departments and approximately 200 community-based organizations (CBOs) funded through CDC HIV cooperative agreements to deliver or support HIV prevention services.</p>
<p>To support the successful implementation of NHM&amp;E and to meet federal data reporting and security requirements it is necessary to provide technical support by e-mail, telephone, and other means to grantees reporting NHM&amp;E data and to track and document end-user requests and responses. This technical support is intended to provide accurate, consistent communication concerning programmatic NHM&amp;E and local data usage issues, to identify elements of software needing modification, to identify grantees in need of enhanced technical assistance, to coordinate access to online and other training materials, and to monitor the implementation of the NHM&amp;E data collections and use of the CDC supplied software.</p>

<DESC>This is Modification 6 to the synopsis entitled Engineering Fabrication Services (EFS), NNJ12414076R, which was posted on May 25, 2012. The purpose of this modification is to address questions asked about the Draft SOW and DRDs. Question 1:	In the synopsis dated May 25, 2012, the Government states:  The base ordering period is February 1, 2013 to January 31, 2016.  A single, two-year option will be established from February 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017.  Should the two-year option run from 2016 to 2018?	 Answer 1:	Yes, the two-year option will run from February 1, 2016 through Jan 31, 2018. Question 2:	Would the Government consider hosting the Pre-Proposal conference before the Final Request for Proposal instead of the currently scheduled 1  weeks after final RFP release, which is only 3 weeks before proposals are due? Answer 2:	The pre-proposal conference will be held on July 16, 2012. At this time, the schedule will remain the same. Any changes to the schedule will be posted on the Engineering Fabrication Services (EFS) website.    Question 3:	In the synopsis dated May 25, 2012, the Government states that:  This contract will be a 100% Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Cost-reimbursement contract.  Will the offeror be provided a Task Order for Program Management and Administrative tasks listed in SOW 1.0 and in particular, SOW 1.1, INNOVATION?  A 100% IDIQ environment may tend to limit an offerors approach to contract management and innovation.  Answer 3:	The Offeror will be provided a Task Order for Program Management and Administrative Tasks listed in the SOW 1.0, however the offeror is free to propose alternate approaches which reduce cost or increase performance/value to the Government. Question 4:	Please verify whether the contractor must be AS9100 registered or compliant; especially with regard to wording in SOWs 1.13 and 2.0.  Answer 4:	Contractor does not have to be AS9100 registered.   However, the contractor shall be compliant with the requirements of AS9100. Question 5:	For Supply Chain / Outsource Supplier purposes, is ITAR registration required? Answer 5:	ITAR registration is not required. However, the Contractor Supply Chain shall be expected to adhere to US Export Control requirements. Question 6:	SOW 1.13, second paragraph states that The contractor shall provide inspection services on all work performed either in-house or outsourced.  Will there be a requirement to use on-site personnel for inspection services (i.e., JSC representatives or other contractor personnel, such as Quality Assurance/Engineering)?	 Answer 6:	The SOW is specifically addressing that the Contractor will be required to perform the in-line Quality Assurance functions and have personnel capable of operating sophisticated measuring equipment such as Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs) and Laser Trackers.  The Contractor will also be required to interface with on-site Government or other contractor personnel, for controlled hardware acceptance.  Question 7:	For SOW 1.20, please define IPC.  Answer 7:	IPC is an organization, formerly known as Interconnections and Packaging Electronics Circuits, who publishes and maintains standards, specifications, and guidelines for Electronics Industry. Question 8:	Under SOW 2.1.1, how is work input controlled for Fabrication Express? The last paragraph implies that Fabrication Express work does not route through Production Control.  Also, will the Government provide technical documents through the technical library regarding Fabrication Express activities?  Answer 8:	The Government will not provide technical documents through the technical library regarding Fabrication Express (also known as Fab Express). The Work that meets the defined criteria for Fab Express is initiated on a simplified form and is on a first come first serve basis but is not routed through formal Production Control. Fab Express work could require the use of standard technical library documentation; however Fab Express does not have its own set of technical documentation. Question 9:	For SOW 3.0, will the Government provide clarification on labor category definitions for Manufacturing Engineering, Design, and Engineering support?  Many Manufacturing Engineers on-site are non-degreed, whereas Engineering Support implies degreed Engineer requirements. Answer 9:	The Government will provide Standard Labor Categories as part of the RFP. Question 10:	Will selected, allowable, existing DRDs be posted in the EFS Tech Library? Answer 10:	The DRDs for this procurement will be provided in the Solicitation. DRDs from the current ESC contract will not be posted in the EFS Tech Library. Question 11:	Please clarify which DRDs are due with the Proposal.  Should we assume that the draft DRDs provided on May 25, 2012, are the only DRDs due with the proposal and others mentioned in the SOW will be due during phase-in or after contract start?  A list of DRDs and associated due dates is provided below for clarification: 	DRD-MGMT-01, Management and Staffing Plan (no due date shown in draft) 	DRD-MGMT-05, Phase-In Plan (no due date shown in draft) 	DRD-MGMT-09, Total Compensation Plan (due with proposal) 	DRD-MGMT-10, OCI Mitigation Plan (no due date shown) 	DRD-SMA-02, Safety & Health Plan (no due date shown) 	DRD-PROP-01, Government Property Management Plan (shows initial due with proposal; final due 30 days after award) Others contained (in order of appearance in the draft SOW), but drafts not yet provided: 	DRD-MGMT-03, Contract Management Report / Reviews (monthly) 	DRD-MGMT-06, Wage, Salary, and Fringe Benefit Plan 	DRD-MGMT-07, Labor Relations Plan 	DRD-MGMT-08, Notification of Potential Labor Dispute and Contingency Strike Plan 	DRD-BP-01, Contractor Financial Management Report 	DRD-MGMT-11, Technology, Innovations, and Process Improvement Plan and Report (TIPI) Plan 	DRD-SMA-03, Safety & Health Program Self-Evaluation 	DRD-SMA-05, Lessons Learned Program Plan 	DRD-EV-01, Environmental and Energy Consuming Product Compliance Reports 	DRD-PROP-03, Resources and Inventory Control Management 	DRD-CM-01, Manufacturing Equipment Data Package Requirements 	DRD-SMA-01, Quality Plan 	DRD-SMA-04, JSC NASA-Advisory/GIDEP Documents Status Tracking System 	DRD-PM-01, Preventative Maintenance Plan  Also, should offerors expect other DRDs not currently mentioned such as: 	Configuration Management Plan 	External Customer Plan Answer 11:	The documents posted as draft documents in a previous posting are likely to be required with the submission of the proposal. A final determination of which DRDs are required, and when those DRDs must be submitted, will be provided in the Solicitation. Question 12:	DRD-MGMT-05 begins lettered paragraphs under 8. Preparation Information at C.  Should the proper numbering start at A?  Yes Similarly, DRD-MGMT-11 begins lettered paragraphs at I SCOPE, and J CONTENT and DRD-SMA-02, begins at O. Answer 12:	Yes, the proper sequence should start at A.  The DRDs referenced above have been reviewed and are corrected in the solicitation. Question 13:	Will the Government identify all manufacturing-specific Information Technology (IT) systems and tools used in support of EFS, particularly if they are managed locally for Buildings 9 and 10 tasks? Answer 13:	IT systems and tools used in the support of EFS will be identified in the solicitation. Question 14:	Under SOW 1.0, fourth paragraph, will the Government require the contractor to provide a financial management system or does the Government currently use an EFS-specific financial system?  Answer 14:	The expectation is that the contractor will possess an adequate accounting system.  FAR 16.301-3 requires the Government to ensure a contractors accounting system is adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract prior to award of a cost-reimbursable contract.	 Question 15:	What is the contractors role for purchasing and installing new equipment?  Answer 15:	When a purchase is approved by the Government, the Contractor will be responsible for purchasing the new equipment and coordinating all activities for installation in the JSC facility. Question 16:	Are there requirements for commercialization efforts? If so, please provide details. Answer 16:	 It is currently anticipated that JSC fabrications efforts are to be focused on supporting existing in-house and contractor hardware development activities. However, it is expected that any available shop excess capacity could be used to support a growing commercialization capability and NASA is willing to consider any options or alternatives which promote these efforts. Question 17:	Please explain the streamlined procurement procedures.	 The reference PowerPoint slides states that a streamlined acquisition process was developed as an alternative to the current SEB process for less complex procurements under $50 million. The solicitation states the maximum contract value for EFS, including all options, is $98.15 Million. Can the streamlined procurement process be used for procurements over $50 Million?   Answer 17:	The SLPT process was developed primarily for less complex procurements under $50M, however it can be used for other acquisitions.  In general the goals of the SLPT procurement are to simplify the RFP proposal development requirements and to reduce both the Offerers as well as the Government proposal development and review time. This approach also lessens Offerer proposal expenses and shortens the overall procurement cycle time to award. Question 18:	What is the contractors role for purchasing and installing new equipment?  Answer 18:	When a purchase is approved by the Government, the Contractor will be responsible for purchasing the new equipment and coordinating all activities for installation in the JSC facility. Question 19:	Are there requirements for commercialization efforts? If so, please provide details. Answer 19:	 It is currently anticipated that JSC fabrications efforts are to be focused on supporting existing in-house and contractor hardware development activities. However, it is expected that any available shop excess capacity could be used to support a growing commercialization capability and NASA is willing to consider any options or alternatives which promote these efforts.

I was wondering if you have a contact that I can reach out to at MEDNOSC to present XXX Security as a possible solution to the above subject?<br><br>Answer 3.  This is a competitive 8(a) set-aside (see block 10 of the solicitation).<br><br>Question 4.  Can the past performance in Volume III be a mix of references from the prime and major subcontractor or must all citations be from the prime?<br><br>Answer 4.  Three (3) references of similar skills/requirements and can be a combination of the prime and subcontractor's experience.<br><br>Question 5.  Is the TOC and Executive Summary (limited to 2 pages) included in the overall page count of 40 pages or is it in addition to?<br><br>Answer 5.  No, the Table of Contents is not part of the 40 page limitation.<br><br>Question 6.  Please confirm the evaluation criteria is Lowest Price Technically Acceptable and not Best Value.<br><br>Answer 6.  Proposals will be evaluated using lowest price technically acceptable criteria.<br><br>Question 7.  In Exhibit G - what do the last 2 columns represent, specifically the 8 and 12? What measurements are the 8 and 12? Hours?<br><br>Answer 7.  Please see paragraph 1.11 regarding On-Call and Maintenance Window Support.  The 8 and 12 reference is the estimated on-call and maintenance window hours of support that is referenced in paragraphs 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7. <br><br>Question 8.  We are located in Mumbai, India. We are interested in participating in the tender mentioned above hence want to get more information about the same.  Considering the geographical constraint of personally reviewing the document, I request you to provide us the following details before we buy the document:<br><br>Answer 8.  This requirement is set aside for companies that are part of the United States Small Business Administration's (SBA) 8(a) program.<br><br>Question 9.  On page 52 of 127, paragraph (3) states that one (1) original and three (3) sanitized copies. Then in each paragraph that discusses each volume, there is a different requirement for each volume as follows: <br><br>Volume I - one (1) original<br>Volume II - one (1) original + four (4) sanitized copies<br>Volume III - one (1) original + two (2) copies<br>Volume IV - one (1) original + two (2) copies<br>Please clarify how many copies of each are required for each volume.<br><br>Answer 9.

Paragraph 1.4.1 will be revised in a forthcoming amendment to indicate that the certifications referenced in 1.4.1 are required upon award.  However, Appendix B has been revised to specify that IT Security Designation and IA Technical Designation have revised to  IT-II. The amendment will be issued by 6 July 2012.<br><br>Question 11.  Vendor X requests an extension of the "offer Due Date (Block 8) from 12:00 PM 18 Jul 2012 to 12:00 PM 31 Jul, 2012.  The basis for this request lies in the RFP itself and the complexity in developing a plan to address the "lack of skilled security technicians" in the San Antonio area.  Our preliminary survey of the San Antonio market indicates that a response that answers the concerns and requirements of the Government would require extensive recruiting and training development as part of the RFP.  Industry requires that time to be fully compliant and deliver complete proposals that would be in the best interest of the government.  An extension of the "Due date" would be appreciated.<br><br>Answer 11.  The RFP due date will NOT be extended.<br><br>Question 12.  On Page 55 of the solicitation is the discussion regarding the Staffing Approach.  Is it the government's intent that offerors provide r sum s of personnel who will fill each of the positions on the contract? If the answer is Yes, will the government also require letters of intent from these respective personnel?<br><br>Answer 12.  The Government is not requesting resumes.<br><br>Question 13.  Is the Executive Summary a part of the Technical Volume page count?<br><br>Answer 13.  The Executive Summary is not part of the 40 page count limitation.<br><br>Question 14.  In the Instructions to Offerors under Paragraph (B) it is stated that the Technical Volume should be no more than 40 pages. However, under (2) Sub-Factor: Operational Approach, subparagraph (f) the offeror is to provide ITIL documentation for IT services with 3 samples not to exceed three pages within the 50 page limit. Our questions are these: (1) are the ITIL documentation examples to be three pages total or three pages each, and is the total volume limit 40 pages or 50? <br><br>Answer 14.  The page limitation for the technical volume is increased to 50.<br><br>Question 15.      Will an extension be granted due to the quick turn around and the 4th of July holiday?<br><br>Answer 15.  An extenstion will not be granted.<br><br>Question 16.  Why wasn't the incumbent given all their option years on the contract?<br><br>Answer 16.  The Government in-sourced several of the positions that were previously provided by contractor support.  This in-sourcing changed the requirements drastically, which resulted in the reorganization of the MEDNOSC.<br><br>Question 17.  Is this new requirement ? or Any incumbent is currently working on this contract?<br><br> Answer 17.  See Question No. 1<br><br>Question 18.  We are graduating from SBA 8(a) program in August 2012, are we still qualified to bid on this proposals?<br><br>Answer 18.

Page 52 of 127, Instructions to Offerors, (b) (1) Early Past Performance Questionnaire Submission is encouraged. Submit the Past Performance Questionnaires (Attachment 4) to the address in the SF 1449, Block 9, on or before the date specified in the SF 1449.

Will the Government clearly identify which Labor Categories they consider "Key Personnel"?  Also, in what volume shall the offeror put the resumes?  If it is in Volume II, will the Government consider excluding resumes of the page count? <br><br>Answer 25.  The Government deletes the requirement for qualifications, experience and education to be submitted for key personnel. <br><br>Question 26.

Can the government clarify these conflicting requirements? <br><br>Answer 32.  See Question 9.<br><br>Question 33.  Are there any restrictions on using the USAMITC logo in our proposal response?<br><br>Answer 33.  The USAMITC logo cannot be used. <br><br>Question 34.
