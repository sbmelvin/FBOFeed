<p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i). Proposed source is Dr. Volodymyr Sabelkin of Fairborn, Ohio (CAGE: 3GPM8, NAICS: 541712). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations: however, all quotations/responses received within THREE (3) days of issuance of this notice will be considered by the Government. Further determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotations should be faxed to Jennifer Kleiv, 88 CONS/PKBB, 937-656-4629 or e-mailed to jennifer.kleiv@wpafb.af.mil no later than&nbsp;12 Jun 09. Only proposals received by this date will be considered. Any questions should be directed to Jennifer Kleiv at 937-522-4629.</p>
<p>The contractor is to plan, organize, and conduct a research program involving the analytical and experimental investigation of symmetrical and non-symmetrical microcontact interaction between smooth homogeneous mono-layered material bodies, and/or heterogeneous multi-layered composite material bodies including friction, sticking, and partial slip, fatigue for elastic and elastic-plastic material behavior with wide spectrum of high resistant and low ductility, and low resistant and high ductility behaviors subjected to cyclic loading. Analysis and experiments of ideal symmetrical problems should be extended to non-symmetrical microcontact interaction between Hertzian (elastic) and non-Hertzian (inelastic) homogeneous/composite solid bodies in homogeneous/nonhomogeneous external fields. Contact interaction between homogeneous, i.e. both mono-layered material and/or heterogeneous, i.e. one of them or both are multi-layered material with smooth surfaces should be analyzed including sticking and local partial slip, fatigue, wear and related damage mechanism. The analysis should include adhesion in case of microcontact interaction, when effect of this interaction commensurable with external loading, as well as elastic plastic isotropic material behavior at first approximation. Models should be applicable to a wide spectrum of materials such as high resistant and low ductility, titanium alloys, and low resistant and high ductility, gold based alloys. Experiments should include destructive and non-destructive techniques. All work, including the preparation of a draft research report, shall be completed by 31 August 2010</p>
<p>The period of performance is 1 September 2009 through 31 August 2010.</p>

Note: in any given season the Government may choose not to order fish doe to the lack of funding. It is expected that fish will be ordered every year. The basic year will require live Channel Catfish deliveries in early summer followed by a live Rainbow Trout deliveries in the fall and live Rainbow Trout deliveries the following spring. The purchase order will contain a Variation in Quantity Clause of + or - 10%. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 112511.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Pittsburgh Research Laboratory, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Sunset Laboratory for Dual Method Carbon Analyzer.
<p>Background</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Research Laboratory is part of NIOSH and focuses its research on the health and safety of miners. Part of its program is to perform research on the analysis of and controls to limit diesel particulate matter. NIOSH method 5040 is used to evaluate control technologies and determine workplace exposures to DPM. This instrument and results are used in many of our projects. Sunset Laboratory Carbon analyzers are used to perform NIOSH 5040. Our carbon analyzer is getting older and costing time and money for repairs throughout the year. A new machine would save repair money and also time of researchers constantly working on the unit. Another method (IMPROVE) is used to analyze for elemental and total carbon for DPM and other carbon particulate samples by other researchers. We currently do not have the capability to perform this test or to compare our results with some other studies. This instrument would perform both the NIOSH 5040 and the IMPROVE method. This would provide us with the opportunity to compare our results with studies using the IMPROVE method and to compare the two methods to investigate how DPM relates to them. All of our experience, parts, MSHA data, mine data, and past NIOSH data are from the Sunset Laboratory instruments. In order to be consistent with data collected in mines from NIOSH and other people and since we already have knowledge how to run these types of instruments, we would like to continue with this manufacturer. We also have experience with these instruments from Sunset Laboratory being accurate.</p>
<p>The Sunset Laboratory has a lower limit of detection and is used by MSHA and other mines to determining DPM exposures. With a different instrument, we may not get results that can be compared to other mining samples including MSHA (regulatory agency) samples. Sunset Laboratory instrument's limit of detection is better than the other instruments that can be used for NIOSH method 5040. It is also compatible with our current setup in the lab since it is replacing an older instrument. It is used by the mining community and MSHA and has been used by NIOSH so that we can compare current data with past results, for some questions have been raised that would suggest another instrument results (from DRI) are not comparable to the Sunset Laboratory instrument results for elemental carbon. This product also uses a 16 bit data system (the DRI used a 12 bit data system).</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret Mooney, Purchasing Agent, Reference number 2009-Q-11350, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Sunset Laboratory, Inc. 10160 SW Nimbus Avenue, Suite F8, Portland, OR 97223-4338 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>EXPRESSION OF INTEREST

The United States Government Farm Service Agency currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Clearfield County, PA located at 478 Jeffers Street, DuBois, Pennsylvania, that will be expiring August 31, 2009. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 3,120 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 2,825 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years.  The space must be available for occupancy by December 1, 2009.  First floor space preferred.  The delineated area is North bounded by: Interstate 80; East bounded by: Sher Dee Lin Game Farm Rd, Gelnett Rd, Rockton Rd, Maple Ave., 13th St., and Oklahoma Salem Rd; South bounded by: Carson Hill Rd. and Route 322 (Behringer Hwy); West bounded by: Blinker Pkwy., Main St., San Spur Rd., Wayne Rd. and the Pancoast Hwy to Smithtown Rd. 

Other applicable requirements include: 

 Parking: 21 on site paved parking spaces. 

 Others.

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC>In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub L 111-5, THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  In accordance with FAR 5.704, Publicizing - Preaward, the Government posts this notice of intent to issue a modification to existing Department of State task order SAQMMA07F1066 under Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract SAQMPD07D0088 with AGTech, LLC, 1801 Research Boulevard, Suite 605, Rockville, MD  20850-3115.

The project description is as follows:  provide information technology support services to the Systems Integrity Division in the Bureau of Information Resource Management in the following areas:  (1) Develop, Implement, and Manage a PK1 Solution; (2) Communications Security Infrastructure Requirements; (3) Anti-Virus Support; (4) Mainframe Security Access Controls; (5) Domestic Technical Service

The original order was awarded as a competitive task order in the 8(a) set-aside pool between the ten Department of State Hybrid Information Technology Services for State (HITSS) 8(a) contractors.  The rationale for using other than a fixed-price approach is that the level of effort for the required IT services depends on variables that were not known prior to task issuance and neither the Government nor the Contractor were able to estimate the extent or duration of the work with any reasonable degree of confidence.  Because of the uncertainly of the work, a fixed price task order could not be reasonably negotiated and only a labor-hour contract could be reasonably awarded.

(This notice is a correction to the notice issued on 5/28/09 which has been cancelled in its entirety.)

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals for a contractor to provide Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition CFSAN develop methods for the isolation and identification of biothreat agents and conventional pathogens in foods. 

A. Project Background:

The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) has specific regulatory responsibilities directed at ensuring the safety of food, food additive, dietary supplement, and cosmetic products.  In part, CFSAN maintains an active research program for the purpose of developing and applying technologies to detect, to identify and evaluate microbial hazards that may contaminate products either naturally or intentionally.  

CFSAN has a research project in place to develop methods for the isolation and identification of biothreat agents and conventional pathogens in foods.  The identification methods currently in place will identify a single agent in a food matrix, which is fine if there is intelligence such as clinical cases of infection that suggest the causative agent of the infection.  However, in the event of an unknown with either biothreat or conventional pathogens, separate methods would be needed to screen for all of the microbial agents of concern.   This analysis would require a large amount of time that could result in significant morbidity and mortality.  Using the multiplex approach such as the Luminex (Bio-plex) system multiple agents could be screened for simultaneously significantly reducing analysis time and removal of contaminated products from the US food supply. 

B. Objective: 

The objective of this potential requirement is to assist CFSAN in fulfilling its regulatory responsibilities and guard the American public from intentional or accidental contamination of the food supply with these microbiological agents. 


C. Additional Information: 

It is anticipated that one (1) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with one (1) base period year and four (4) option years will be awarded. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). The solicitation/request for proposal will be written and an upload to this pre-solicitation notice. NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE. The anticipated award date for this effort is on or around September 1, 2009.

<p>The Health Resources and Services Administration requires regular updates of the resident civilian populations of counties, minor civil divisions (MCDs), census tracts (CTs) and zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) to support the shortage areas designation process, Area Resource File (ARF), Primary Care Service Area (PCSA) file, and other programs.

<p>The Department of Commerce's Census Bureau updates total county populations annually, but only Nielsen-Claritas, Inc. estimates population changes at the tract, MCD and zip levels on an annual basis, and does updates of low income population data at such levels.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with XIA, LLC, of Hayward, California, for the acquisition of two digital pulse processors in NIM chassis for NISTs beamline laboratories at the National Synchrotron Light Source located at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. 

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

This requirement is for two digital pulse processors in NIM chassis for use on a neutron beamline. 

A major system is being developed on the X24A beamline operated by NIST at the National Synchrotron Light Source located at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.  The required digital pulse processors in NIM chassis are being purchased for use with the laboratorys new solid state x-ray detector on beamline X24A.   

Sole source justification is based on the fact that it is mandatory that the pulse processors in NIM chassis which are being purchased for beamline X24A be fully interchangeable with the existing XIA digital pulse processor electronics currently in use on beamline U7A.   In addition, the existing cross beamline control software, specially written for NIST, is compatible solely with XIA boards.  System integration, interchangeability and compatibility across the beamlines is essential for operation success.  

XIA is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required digital pulse processors in NIM chassis.  Sourcing this equipment from any other vendor would require the replacement of all of the existing digital pulse processor electronics on all beamlines, as well as rewriting the existing cross beamline control software, incurring an unacceptable delay in the development of the beamline system as well as unnecessary duplication of costs.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, New York, 11973. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) has a requirement for capabilities and facilities to establish and manage a Statistical and Coordinating Center to provide support for the Atopic Diseases Research Network clinical studies and clinical trials  

Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent immunologic, infectious, and allergic diseases.  The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) supports extramural basic, pre-clinical and clinical research focusing on immune-mediated diseases through a variety of research grants and contracts.  This includes support for clinical research to evaluate the safety and efficacy of therapeutic and preventive approaches and agents and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of such approaches and agents.

This requirement for the Statistical and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) for the Atopic Dermatitis Research Network provides critical services for the design, implementation, oversight (including regulatory support and compliance, safety and clinical site monitoring and reporting, training, and distribution and quality control of study products), and analysis of DAIT, NIAID-supported Atopic Dermatitis Research Network clinical studies and clinical trials and associated mechanistic studies being conducted by this group.

The purpose of the Atopic Dermatitis Research Network (ADRN) is to study the defense mechanisms of the skin, with research focused on atopic dermatitis (AD) and its association with both immune and skin barrier defects (compared to non-atopic individuals). Specific research areas may include the defects resulting in susceptibility to eczema vaccinatum (EV) and eczema herpeticum (EH), and to colonization and infection with Staphylococcus aureus (SA) (including methicillin-resistant Staphylcoccus aureus, MRSA), and responsiveness of AD subjects to vaccines. It is anticipated that research conducted within the ADRN will utilize state of the art techniques to measure immune responses and skin barrier function, and will capitalize on new scientific opportunities and advancements in the field. The ADRN will support multi-disciplinary teams that include qualified personnel committed to the project in areas proposed.  This is likely to include immunologists, virologists, bacteriologists, geneticists, dermatologists and allergists.

This Network was originally established as the Atopic Dermatitis and Vaccinia Network (ADVN), consisting of three contracts: a Clinical Studies Consortium, an Animal Studies Consortium and a Statistical and Data Coordinating Center These three contracts were originally funded from 2004-2009, and the contracts were then extended until 2010. The ADVN has been focused on the pathogenesis of EV, with the ultimate goal of reducing the severity of EV, but the new solicitation extends the scope of the Network to the research areas described above.

The initial ADVN SDCC contract was awarded to Rho Federal Systems, Inc. in 2004 (Contract Number HHSN26620040033C ) and has served to provide a broad range of clinical research support services to the ADVN.  Under this contract, those services will be continued and will also be expanded to provide support for the expanded research areas of the new Atopic Dermatitis Research Network.

It is anticipated one cost reimbursement completion type contract will be awarded for a period of five years, beginning approximately June 30, 2010. It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately 8.25 FTEs.

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  This RFP will be available electronically on/about June 16, 2009, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC><p>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), strives to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent immunologic, infectious, and allergic diseases The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation intends to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA-NIAID-DAIT-NIHAI2009027) entitled "The ATOPIC DERMATITIS RESEARCH NETWORK (ADRN)".</p>
<p>The goal of this ADRN is to study defense mechanisms of the skin, with research focused on atopic dermatitis (AD) and its association with both immune and skin barrier defects (compared to non-atopic individuals). Specific research areas may include the defects resulting in susceptibility to eczema vaccinatum (EV) and eczema herpeticum (EH), and to colonization and infection with Staphylococcus aureus (SA) (including methicillin-resistant Staphylcoccus aureus, MRSA), and responsiveness of AD subjects to vaccines. It is anticipated that research conducted within the ADRN will utilize state of the art techniques to measure immune responses and skin barrier function, and will capitalize on new scientific opportunities and advancements in the field.</p>
<p>Offerors must propose an AD research program that consists of at least two (up to four) research projects. The program must include a project in either Research Area 1 or Research Area 2, and at least one additional project in any of the remaining three research areas. Each research project must focus on a different research area from among the four research areas. These include: Research Area 1, susceptibility to Eczema Vaccinatum and/or Eczema Herpeticum; Research Area 2, susceptibility to staphylococcal colonization and infections, including MRSA; Research Area 3, susceptibility to colonization and/or infection with other organisms, including commensals (that is, organisms not included in research areas 1 and 2); Research Area 4, immune responses to vaccines.</p>
<p>For purposes of this solicitation, "AD subsets" refers to individuals who are distinguishable clinically and/or in immune and/or skin barrier function and/or genetic markers from other individuals with AD.</p>
<p>Research conducted under Research Area 1 may include the following: the genetic variants in AD and AD subsets, and the host's immune function, skin barrier function and gene expression in response to vaccinia virus and/or herpes simplex virus. The study of genetic variants in AD and AD subsets must include racial and ethnic groups that expand beyond the populations examined in the Atopic Dermatitis Vaccinia Network Clinical Studies Consortium (Caucasian and African-American). Research conducted under Research Area 2 may include the following: the genetic variants in AD and AD subsets, and the host's immune function, skin barrier function and gene expression in response to staphylococcal colonization and infection. Research conducted under Research Area 3 may include the following: the genetic variants in AD and AD subsets, and the host's immune function, skin barrier function and gene expression in response to the organisms, including commensals, being evaluated. Research conducted under Research Area 4 may include the following: the genetic variants in AD and AD subsets and the host's immune function, skin barrier function and gene expression in response to immunization with one or more vaccines.</p>
<p>The research program must also maintain data currently stored in the ADVN registry of AD subjects and subsets of AD subjects, and data from control subjects and expand data to include additional subjects. Subjects should represent diverse racial and ethnic groups as well as subjects with AD without EH, AD with history of EH, AD with other clinical entities such as MRSA and MSSA colonization and infection; and AD subjects with manifestations of other atopic diseases (allergic rhinitis, asthma, food allergy). The research program must also maintain and expand the ADVN repository of biological specimens.</p>
<p>The NIAID anticipates a single cost reimbursement completion-type award will be made, for a five (5) year period of performance, beginning on or about June 30, 2010. The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research.  In no event shall the period of performance proposed by an offeror exceed five 5 years.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  This BAA will be available electronically on/about June 16, 2009, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

The evaluation will consider the offerors A/E capability through the examination of SF 330s as well as other relevant factors or subfactors as required by FAR part 36. Furthermore, the contractor or J/V will be evaluated for its capability to perform the upgrade by measuring its construction capabilities, the suitability of its technical proposal, and other related factors including Cost/Price/Budget/Past Performance IAW FAR part 15. Evaluation factors will be fully defined in the published solicitation. A date, time, and location for a pre-proposal conference will be established in the solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA),
Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a 9 month sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, 1101 15th Street, NW, Suite 1212, Washington, DC 20005.
	
The purpose of this contract is for the agencys interest in learning the extent of local mental health departments demonstrate ownership of the problem by forming PI teams comprising responsible public agencies (e.g., mental health, housing, police, Medicaid and employment services).

Specifically, SAMHSA seeks an analysis of specific instances of police involvement and devise and implement remedies to reduce the likelihood of recurrence. This includes:

If the remedies involve reconfiguring service approaches used by mental health or other agencies; also, if they will likely include bottom-up recommendations for changes in reimbursement and other public policies;

Are consistent with a recent recommendation by the Joint Commission (JCAHO), its scope extends beyond the walls of the individual mental health care facility and examines both the precursors of crises and the preventive impact of crisis interventions;

Builds on an effective service reform achieved within mental health: Drawing on lessons from programs to eliminate the use of seclusion and restraint, it recasts a heretofore routine-but inherently harmful-crisis intervention as a failure in care;

CMHS envisions an initiative that will work intensively with three or four sites to roll out the program in ways that capitalize on local political dynamics.  These efforts will provide evidence to build a template for sustainable change nationwide.  In each site, the community mental health authority will play a key role (thus far, state officials have been very enthusiastic and helpful in identifying potential sites, but have generally opted to take a background role in order to spur local ownership).  The role of the contractor will be to coordinate the development of the local teams, to facilitate cross-team interactions, to assist in problem solving and to develop and implement strategies for needed change at the local, state and federal levels. 
In addition to the longer range impact of this initiative in launching and sustaining this nascent initiative, SAMHSA anticipates this will produce two more immediate benefits: a report that can be used as a training tool to further foster interest among state and local mental health authorities and accrediting bodies (such as JCAHO), and a resource to generate data and individual stories that can be essential as the mental health community asserts itself in healthcare reform efforts. 

All reports, statistics, or tables produced under this project shall be the property of the Federal government, which includes the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).  SAMHSA or CMHS may utilize, print, or disseminate such material without further charge.

No other articles or publications which rely substantially on materials produced under this project shall be published by either party without prior consultation and approval.

The contractor shall be responsible for but not limited to the following tasks:
Meet with the GPO and other CMHS/SAMHSA staff in order to determine the best 
approach for accomplishing the tasks covered by this contract.

Create an inventory of existing data resources.  Based on early work with the site, this
will include such information as police call logs and diversion requests, mental health 
service utilization, and community- or system-mapping.  
From these data, identification of specific patterns that put people with serious mental 
illnesses at risk of police encounters. Among scenarios tentatively being explored by sites
are waiting lists of uninsured consumers and settings such as train and bus stations frequented by homeless individuals.

Identification of operational barriers to be overcome, including cross-system data sharing,
Organizational resistance, turf issues, and so on.
 
Convene a meeting that brings together representatives from each site. Through technical
assistance, workgroups have expressed strong enthusiasm for the project, but also a 
strong interest in understanding early on how other sites are proceeding with planning.
 
Prepare a written report based on the meeting of sites, explaining to communities how 
establish their own PI initiative and providing examples from local officials of barriers to progress and opportunities for reform of their respective mental health programs.  This written material will not only be useful to mental health practice but will also propel the project forward and enable us to secure further funding.

The contractor shall be responsible for the following deliverables:
Approval of the Work Plan after start of award in consultation with Project Officer. 
1-4 weeks after start of contract			

Identify the specific inventory of existing data resources, in consultation with Project Officer.   4-8 weeks after start of contract
 
Submit specific patterns that put people with serious mental illnesses at risk of police encounters.  8-12 weeks after start of contracts
Provide compilation of specific sub-populations to be targeted as the PI initiative and operational barriers to overcome.  12-20 weeks after start of contract

The Government contemplates pricing for the Construction Phase Services, Option 3, to be broken down for evaluation purposes, into prices corresponding to: Construction Phase Construction Management Services, Estimated Direct General Conditions, Cost Available to Fund Construction, Profit, Overhead, Daily Delay Rate, and Subcontractor Commission.  It is anticipated that a firm, fixed price based upon the general construction services required will be negotiated prior to exercising the Construction Phase Option.  The CMc will be competitively chosen using the federal acquisition regulations, Source Selection Procedures (FAR 15.3), and the "Best Value Trade-off" process.   For this procurement, technical factors when combined are more important than price.  All elements of the work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitation budget.

<DESC>The GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural/engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals.  All projects will be LEED-EB certified.PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project involves the modernization of the HVAC systems and the installation of a sprinkler system throughout the Minton-Capehart Federal Building.  Architect/Engineering (A/E) design services and preparation of design documents are required for this renovation project.  Built in 1974, the Minton-Capehart Federal Building is located at 575 North Pennsylvania Street in Indianapolis, Indiana.  The Minton-Capehart building is a Modernist six story building with a ground floor below grade, a mechanical mezzanine above grade, and a penthouse above the core area of the sixth floor.  Attached to the building is a two-level parking facility.  The prime objectives of this project include, but are not limited to:  1) upgrading the HVAC systems to improve indoor air quality throughout the building; 2) reducing energy consumption using more efficient equipment and controls; 3) improving the safety of the building occupants and reducing the loss of property in the event of a fire.  It is anticipated the project delivery method will include the procurement of a Construction Manager (constructor) (CMc) in order to review both the constructability and cost of the project as the design is developed.  The project will be phased and the building will be occupied during construction.
SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architectural, engineering, interior design, and related consulting services for verification of existing systems and conditions, concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), document preparation to be used in providing clear direction to the CM team, as well as possible post-construction contract services (PCCS) that may include shop drawing review and approval, construction inspection, and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government.
For the Minton-Capehart Federal Office Building, the scope of design work as it relates to the planned modernization and renovation would include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: (1) survey of existing conditions; (2) detailed scope verification; (3) energy conservation analysis; (4) complete architectural and engineering design; (5) preparation of specifications and CADD drawings for construction documents; (6) value engineering; (7) costs analysis; (8) post-construction contract services (PCCS); (8) record drawings and construction phase A/E inspection services.  
Throughout the design process, the selected lead designer and A/E will assist the Government in identifying those elements of work that can be accomplished within the Congressionally-mandated cost limitation for the project.  The scope of Construction work to be covered in the design, as it relates to the planned modernization and renovation will include, but not be limited to, the following:  (1)  refurbish the air-handling units for greater airflow to provide the recommended minimum amount of fresh air for each occupant and improve the total air circulation; (2)  replace the fiberglass branch distribution ductwork and diffusers to handle greater airflows and eliminate contamination from glass fiber in the environmental air, (3)  replace the stair pressurization fans with larger fans that will produce the necessary pressures and airflows; (4)  provide a new direct digital control (DDC) temperature control system for energy efficiency; (5)  provide additional commissioning of the system and other improvements for LEED-EB certification; (6)  utilize the existing dry standpipe risers in the stairs as a part of a new sprinkler system; (7)  provide sprinkler protection extending from the mains to each space in the building; (8)  provide a new fire pump and jockey pump, installed in the ground floor mechanical room, to boost the pressure for the new sprinkler system; (9)  provide new lay-in ceilings, repair hard ceilings, and replace lighting throughout the building with modular wiring and automatic controls for lower maintenance costs, easier adds and moves, and greater energy efficiency.  
GSA is in the process of evaluating federal buildings of the 1950s through the 1970s.  The lead designer and A/E shall identify, assess, and preserve character-defining features and attributes of the original design.  Design changes are to be well-integrated and compatible with the original design so that the building retains its architectural character.  A lead designer and A/E shall work with GSAs regional historic preservation staff to determine potential effects to these features and attributes due to proposed alterations.  The project will meet GSA design standards for secure facilities, conform to the P100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), include LEED-EB certification; and respond to customer agency requirements.
SELECTION PROCESS
This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms with a lead designer/engineer interested in contracting for this work.

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances  the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.

II.  Minimum Qualifications

	U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.
	Extensive experience in the engineering or project management field, including mastery of concepts, principles, laws and regulations associated with the broad areas of international relations, particularly as it relates to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs.  One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service. A Bachelor's Degree from an accredited institution in a field related to business or engineering is desired.
	Understanding of architecture and engineering principles sufficient to be able to investigate and provide information and guidance on the range of systems, processes, and components inherent in the design and construction of new buildings, training facilities and related structures.
	Understanding of contract administration principles, regulations and procedures, including US Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), DOS Acquisition Regulations, and commercial procurement procedures.
	Ability to communicate effectively, orally and in writing, as well as the ability to interact with individuals at all levels.
	Ability to multi-task, working on and bearing responsibility for several simultaneous in country projects while keeping the overall program and bureau goals in perspective. 
	Skill in using word processing, spreadsheet, and data base computer applications.  Significant Microsoft Excel experience and expertise is required.
III. POSITION ELEMENTS

Supervisory Controls: The incumbent receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the Division Chief, the Executive Director/Controller, the Assistant Secretary and DASs.  The incumbent proceeds independently in planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations.

Although acting independently, the incumbent coordinates and communicates with not only the AIJS Chief and the Executive Director/Controller, but also with senior level officials in the Department and at post, as well as senior officials in participating USG agency and foreign governments individually or jointly involved in carrying out the INL mission.  The incumbents actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.  Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.  The AIJS Chief, the RM Director, the Assistant Secretary and DASs rely on his/her judgment in carrying out this mission.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, management, and financial capability of such offerors to perform this type of work.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside is warranted or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is: 237990 Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction (Dredging).    The small business size standard for NAICS Code 237990 is $20 million. 
The purpose of the proposed project is for a Contractor to furnish all of the labor, dredge, support equipment, materials, and incidentals necessary for the performance of maintenance dredging along the overflow weir from the headworks of the All American Canal and north along the Colorado River channel for a distance of approximately 3,000 feet, approximately 2,100 feet along the face of the dam and weir, and approximately 1,200 feet north up the secondary river channel above the Gila Sluiceway adjacent to Hidden Shores (formerly Imperial Oasis) on the Arizona side of the river channel.     
In addition to affecting the ability to store sluicing flows, sediment deposition above Imperial Dam has resulted in nuisance vegetation growth near hydraulic features, which compromise the operational function of the reservoir and the structural integrity of the Dam, including features of historical value. 
Depending upon the availability of funding, Reclamation will also require the maintenance dredging of the Laguna Settling Basin.  The Laguna Basin dredging will be an executable option to the Imperial Dredging requirement.
It should be noted, the dredge and associated equipment are required to operate over a large temperature variation.  Ambient air temperatures can range from the lower 30's during the winter months to highs of 120 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer months (June through September).
The project period of performance is anticipated to begin November 6, 2009 with an anticipated completion date of November 1, 2010. 
Should you be interested in this effort, please submit a capability package to Wendy Williams at the address listed below.  Capability statements are to be submitted no later than 4 June, 2009.  The capability statement shall address the work listed above, demonstrate the company's capability to perform the work, and describe previous procurements performed of similar size and complexity.

<a href="mailto:connie.m.houpt@faa.gov">connie.m.houpt@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for project management, engineering and installation/construction work for power systems and power system ancillary equipment and structures.  The engineering services include: site surveys, coordination studies, and design specifications and drawings.  The installation and construction work includes but is not limited to: Engine Generators (EG), fuel tanks, fuel systems, Uninterruptible Power Systems (UPS), power panels, Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning (HVAC), equipment shelters, remote maintenance monitoring systems, and miscellaneous electrical work.  The general equipment size range, intended for installation, is: engine generators from 20 kW to 1,000 kW; UPS from 15 kVA up to 1,100 kVA.
Work performed under this requirement will be replacement, enhancement and/or maintenance of existing power systems.  The majority of work will be replacement of power systems in existing facilities.  The facility size, and corresponding power service capacity, ranges from small sites with a 20 kW Engine Generator (EG) to consolidated critical power facilities with multiple 1 MW EGs.  The vast majority of sites have EGs in the small 100 kW to medium 500 kW range.  Approximately twenty-nine (29) sites can be classified as large critical power facilities.  The work at large critical power sites is more complex and involves a higher risk to the Air Traffic Control system than work performed at the smaller facilities.  The SOW differentiates work into two (2) categories; small-to-medium size facilities and large facilities.  The two categories are General National Air Space (GNAS) and Critical Power Distribution Systems (CPDS).
It is anticipated that Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity type contracts, with fixed priced pricing arrangements, will be awarded covering these services.  The resultant contracts will include a base year and four 1-year renewal options.  These options may or may not be exercised, at the sole discretion of the FAA.
"Q&A Open period."  Questions regarding the solicitation and/or Statement of Work shall be provided electronically to the Contracting Officer (connie.m.houpt@faa.gov) prior to June 12, 2009.
A pre-proposal conference will be held in Oklahoma City on June 19, 2009.  See SIR/RFO Provision L.8 Pre-proposal Conference, page 65.  Questions received during the Q&A open period will be addressed at the pre-proposal conference.  It is not necessary to attend the pre-proposal conference to submit a proposal or receive responses to the questions.  Q&As will be posted on the FAA Contract Opportunities website following the pre-proposal conference.  
A technical, as well as cost, evaluation will be conducted to determine "Best Value" to the FAA.  A description of the technical submittal and subsequent evaluation can be found in Sections L and M of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).  It is anticipated that up to eight contracts will be awarded as a result of this SIR/RFO.  This requirement has been partially set-aside for small businesses.  No more than two contracts will be awarded to large businesses and at least two contracts will be awarded to SEDB [8(a) certified] businesses with the remaining contracts being awarded within the small business program.  The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 238210 Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors.  The business size standard for this NAICS is $14 million.

<DESC><p>This is the public notice for acquisitions over $10,000.
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), located at MacDill AFB, FL intends to issue a sole source fixed price purchase order to IX Systems, Inc. San Jose, CA for 13 ea. IX 2U Jupiter Rackmount Servers model No.IX2800C w/700W redundant Power Supply and 13 ea. Spare Power Supply Units 700W for the IX2800C servers. The IX servers and power supplies are a part of a system design under a previously competed contract. They support the Airborne Atmospheric Measurement and Profiling System (AAMPS) on NOAA's aircraft fleet. AAMPS is essentially the new scientific data acquisition system that is being developed for NOAA AOC under Government contract. These items are being purchased as "remaining required units" as a result of a system evaluation which has been taking place at AOC since May of 2008. The system provides critical weather information and scientific research data to the flight crews and scientists.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. IX Systems designed and built the servers and power supplies that are required components of the AAMPS system.

<DESC>1.2	Description

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Special Communications Requirement Division  (SCRD) is looking for information from companies with the products and capabilities to provide Commercial off the Shelf (COTS), Non-Developmental Items (NDI), or near NDI component technologies that can provide multiple levels of data storage hardware and software.  SCR is interested in receiving information from vendors who are currently using the most advanced technologies in the design and fabrication of these component items.  

The Government may acquire for testing purposes one or more vendor products.  

SOCOM defines primary storage as the networked storage media providing on line, i.e. real time access, to data critical to the operation of mission critical and mission essential applications.  Such applications include but are not limited to Streaming Media, Microsoft (MS) Exchange e-mail databases, (Structured Query Language) SQL Server, ORACLE, Sharepoint, file stores and server virtualization environments.  To qualify as a candidate for primary storage, the system must meet the following minimum requirements:

The primary storage system must be compatible with the following operating system environments:  Novel Netware, Sun Solaris, Linux, VMware ESX, and Microsoft Windows 2000 and subsequent versions.  The system must also be capable of accepting domestic (United States) and international electrical power at 115 Volts and/or 240 Volts Alternating Current (AC) power at 60 Hertz, and 220 Volts AC power at 50 Hertz.  The primary storage system must support redundancy/fault tolerance features including redundant power supplies, redundant control heads, and device clustering.  At a minimum, the system must support network interface types including Gigabit Ethernet and Fiber Channel.  The primary storage system must support Internet Small Computer System Interface (ISCSI) and Fiber Channel Storage Area Network (SAN) protocols, as well as the Network Attached Storage (NAS) protocols Common Internet File System (CIFS), Network File System (NFS), Netware Core Protocol (NCP), and Direct Access File System (DAFS).  The system must support Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) levels capable of providing high performance and redundancy for the previously mentioned application.  The system must support snapshots/near term backups and third party backup software, data de-duplication, as well as the New Technology File System (NTFS), Unix File System (UFS), and network based management software.  The primary storage system must support integration with MS Active Directory Domains, and support at least 300 Gigabytes of usable storage with adequate spare drives.  The vendor must identify the form factors of their proposed solutions (size and weight of components), as well as power requirements, cooling enhancements, security features, and any built-in diagnostic capabilities.  The vendor should clearly indicate which previous standalone systems are being combined and how their system reduces the total hardware set and space claim, power consumption, heat transfer and any environmental specifications related to a reduction in energy costs.  In addition, the suppliers should identify if their proposed solutions are of an open system architecture consisting of COTS items or of a proprietary design.  The vendor should identify the technical readiness level of their system and clarify (support) any such statements that claim tested, approved or fielded.  The vendor should identify any relationships with Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) and System Integrators (SIs).  Additionally, the vendor should identify any enhancements or capabilities that distinguish them from other similar competition, such as: range of features, open systems approach, modularity and scalability, human factors, ease of upgrade, or other relevant distinctions.  Furthermore, the vendor must identify the following post-sale support information: detailed warranty information, training provided, level of support, and service level agreement for the stated level of support.

SCR will be reviewing technology found to be technically relevant in an effort to refine requirements and gain better understanding of the current and future state of technology for these types of systems.  The Government may invite select vendors to make available their systems or solutions for government evaluation.  The Government is also seeking recommendations from industry regarding best practices in executing dual evaluations. 

THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), BUT RATHER A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) from industry that will allow the Government to identify and evaluate technology from interested sources capable of meeting the requirements as stated in this synopsis.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of the effort mentioned above. 

Interested parties are requested to submit their comments, and can additionally provide a capabilities statement of no more than 5 pages in length that demonstrates the respondents ability to meet the requirements as specified herein.  The Government is interested in receiving vendors commercial published price lists for items they believe meet the need in this RFI, and is also interested in lead-time.  All data received in response to this RFI, marked or designated as corporate or proprietary, will be fully protected from release outside the Government and its service support contractors.  The Government does intend to use contractors to assist with the evaluation of supplier responses meeting indicated specifications as noted in this RFI.  Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future associated RFP that may be issued.  Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website: www.fbo.gov.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any follow-on information.  All responses must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, indication of the technology readiness level or maturity of the  technology, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements, an estimated schedule and an estimated cost for the price of the test articles and production units.  All responses shall be submitted no later than 18 June 2009.  All interested parties should send any comments or questions to Robert Battaglia, email:  robert.battaglia@navy.mil or phone: 732-323-7535 in Microsoft Word format or Portable Document Format (PDF).   

The Government is not committed nor obligated to pay for the information provided, and no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for information.

For example, if breakfast is provided, in a locality with a $59.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the breakfast rate in the locality is $11.00 per breakfast. Therefore, the cost of the breakfast provided at the conference cannot exceed $16.50 ($11.00 X 150%) per person.</p>
<p>If lunch will be provided in a locality with a $59.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the lunch rate in the locality is $16.00 per lunch. Therefore, the cost of the lunch provided at the conference cannot exceed $24.00 ($16.00 X 150%) per person.</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this "sources sought" is to identify hotels willing to provide meeting space, lodging, and meals in the Memphis, TN area, in light of new guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Justice Programs.
<p>Two of the new requirements prescribe limits for meals and refreshments served at breaks. Regarding meals, the new guideline states that the cost of any meal provided, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 150 percent of the locality M&amp;IE per meal. For example, if breakfast is provided, in a locality with a $49.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the breakfast rate in the locality is $9.00 per breakfast. Therefore, the cost of the breakfast provided at the conference cannot exceed $13.50 ($9.00 X 150%) per person.</p>
<p>If lunch will be provided in a locality with a $49.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the lunch rate in the locality is $13.00 per lunch. Therefore, the cost of the lunch provided at the conference cannot exceed $19.50 ($13.00 X 150%) per person.</p>
<p>The new guideline defines refreshments as light food and drinks served at breaks and include such items as coffee, tea, milk, juice, soft drinks, donuts, bagels, fruit, pretzels, cookies, chips, or muffins. Under the new guidelines the cost of these items, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 23 percent of the locality (M&amp;IE) for both morning and afternoon breaks. For the Memphis, TN area, the M&amp;IE rate is $49.00 per person. Therefore, the cost of the refreshments cannot exceed $11.27 ($49.00 X 23%) per person per day.</p>
<p>Any hotel source interested and capable of providing lodging at the Federal per diem rates and meeting the new guideline requirements should submit a statement of capabilities, to include sleeping and meeting capacity, floor charts, and food and beverage menus, to the point of contact identified. The food and beverage menus should support the pricing mentioned above, including hotel service costs: breakfast, $13.50 per person; lunch, $19.50 per person; and refreshments for both morning and afternoon breaks, $11.27 per person.</p>

<DESC>The United States Government is seeking sources for Office and Related Space
in the Central Employment Area, Washington, DC.

REQUIREMENT:     The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in Washington, DC, under a lease that expires on November 30, 2008.  The Government is seeking to lease 104,934 BOMA Rentable Square Feet (BRSF) of office and related space, including 6 parking spaces.  The 104,934 BRSF of space must yield at least 96,557 BOMA Area Square Feet (BOASF).  The space must be provided in one building.  The delineated area for this requirement is the Central Employment Area in Washington, DC.  

The requirement is for a 10-year term fully serviced lease with termination options after the 7th year.  The space must be ready for occupancy by December 1, 2008.  

The Government intends to enter into a sole source procurement to remain in its existing leased space but will accept expressions of interest to determine whether there are other potentially acceptable locations that demonstrate the best interests of the Government are served by moving to an alternate location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, relocation costs, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements.  The Government is presently seeking authority to enter into a sole source succeeding lease at the existing location and therefore reserves the right to cancel any ongoing procurement that might result from the identification of other potentially acceptable locations.

The Governments decision regarding whether or not to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this notification.  In the event that a potentially acceptable offer fails to provide required information as part of its response to this notification, the Government reserves the right to assume that the building in question cannot meet the Governments requirements.

Expressions of interest must be in writing and should be forwarded by 3:00 pm on Friday, September 10, 2008 to:

<DESC>Pursuant  to FAR 15.2,  the Guidance Systems Branch, Weapons Development  Integration Directorate of the U.S. Army Aviation  and Missile Research,  Development, and  Engineering Center, AMRDEC,  hereby issues  this Request for  Information, RFI,  regarding  a study to define  a medium  altitude  Height-of-Burst,  HOB,  Sensor for the MLRS  Kinetic Energy Rod, KE  Rod program.  This study will provide a better understanding of the state of the art for the HOB sensor technology and identify potential candidate designs or approaches for ultimate implementation in MLRS KE Rod.  THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  Rather this RFI is part of a technology survey that  is  an integral part of US Army planning efforts  for possible future programs.  Informal  or white paper response using  font size 10 or 12, with  one inch margins in Microsoft Word or Adobe  Acrobat PDF  format  containing a description of appropriate technologies and  how these technologies can be applied to this project are encouraged.  The following device specifications are derived from a set of notional system requirements and can be viewed as performance goals.   1. HOB Technology: RF, Laser or other. GPS systems are not under consideration at this time.  2. Nominal  Height of Burst: 200-400 meters  or 250-500m slant range.  3. Target Surfaces will be:  Soil wet or dry, Concrete wet or dry, water, dense foliage, and dense scrub.   4. Signal attenuation, loss, shall be negligible due to visual obscurants.  The value of the attenuation is TBD.  Visual obscurants include fog, smoke, rain, ice, snow, sleet , hail, and dust.   5.  Modes of Operation:  Proximity: selectable HOB, other ranges are TBD.  Time delay.  Self Destruct.   6. HOB  Accuracy:  Standard Deviation. 1 sigma  equals 10 percent of selected height .  7. Time Delay Mode:  Detonation to occur at expiration of set time plus 3.2 seconds.   8. Time Range:  5.0-199.9 seconds in 0.1 increments.   9.  Mission Profile: 8.5 seconds  launch, 100 seconds flight.  10. Angle of Approach:  HOB mode if Angle is greater than 20 degrees with  respect to horizontal , Time mode if Angle  is less than or equal to  20 degrees with respect  to horizontal.  11. Physical Characteristics:  Ogive shall be the same as the M445 fuze.  Shall interface  mechanically to the rocket in the same manner as the M445  fuze.  Size and shape  shall be the same  as the M445 fuze.  12.  Notable Environmental Characteristics:  Flight Altitude: Sea level to 40 kM.  Rain:  55.8 mm/hr plus or minus 12.7 mm/hr.   Tube Cover Push thru Shock: 12.3 kN, 15 ms, one half sine pulse.  13.  Power  will be supplied  from a thermal battery.   Voltage and current levels are TBD.   14. The HOB sensor will accept an enable  signal to power the transmitter.  The HOB sensor will not transmit a ranging signal unless enabled.  15.  The HOB sensor will provide fire command to the fuze within 100 microseconds  after detecting  the correct HOB.   16.  All existing interfaces  to the MLRS Fire Control System (FCS) and  the M445 fuze must be maintained.  The FCS will select the HOB  mode, set the time, if necessary , and the HOB sensor will retain the settings as long  as it is powered by the FCS.    If power is lost before the thermal battery is squibbed, the settings will not be retained.   HOB sensor designs  that do not quite meet these requirements may still be of  interest  if there is a  potential  decrease  in cost or if there is a potential  increase in reliability, safety,  or performance.   Aspects of the design  that are proprietary or have usage restrictions such as licensing requirements or restriction on modifications  or operator servicing  should be clearly identified.  Interested  and capable U.S. sources only, are asked to submit a white paper  compatible  with Microsoft  Word, Rich Text  Format, or Adobe Portable Document Format, containing a description of appropriate technologies they possess, or are developing, and how those technologies  could be applied  to this  project.

<RESPDATE>061509
<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Paper, Copying, Xerographic by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>7530-01-412-5168, Paper, Copying, Xerographic. 8.27 x 11.69, White, 30 % Post Consumer Waste 50% Recycled Process Chlorine Free, Acid-Free European Cut, Style A4, 5000 sheets per box.</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the General Service Administration, New York, NY.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Paper, Copying, Xerographic to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>HAM-10303-6</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Paper, Copying, Xerographic to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than June 15, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<SUBJECT>Sole Source Modification to Washington Metroploitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA)
<SOLNBR>Ep-W-09-010
<RESPDATE>061509
<CONTACT>Andrea L. Brunsman, Contracting Officer, Phone 2025649699, Email brunsman.andrea@epa.gov
<DESC><p>The U.S. EPA intends to award a sole source modification (per 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)) to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) for increased SmartBenefits and&nbsp;MetroCheks for employees per the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) Part V - Parity for Transportation Fringe Benefits.</p>
<p>EPA Headquarters has a policy aimed at improving air quality and reducing traffic congestion by offering employees incentives to commute to and from work using public transportation. Federal agency participation in specific transit benefit programs is authorized by Public Law 103-172 and Executive Order 13150, entitled "Federal Workforce Transportation." The purpose of this contract is to procure public transportation fare media (MetroCheks and SmartBenefits) in support of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Transit Subsidy Program pursuant to Public Law 103-172 which allows agencies to support employee commuting costs when public transportation is used.</p>
<p>Per the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) Part V - Parity for Transportation Fringe Benefits increases the amount of qualified transportation fringe benefits that are excluded from gross income from $121 to $230 per month starting from the date of the enactment of the ARRA through January 1, 2011 per P.L. 111-5 Section 1151. Increased Exclusion Amount For Commuter Transit Benefits and Transit Passes.</p>
<p>These benefits are to retroactively begin on February 2009 - December 30, 2010, that equates to 20 months at the higher monthly rate per the ARRA. This increases the total valus of the contract by approximately $2.3 million. However, the increase in transportation benefits may be extended beyond the December 31, 2010 date that is currently set and may need to be applied to the remainder of the contract through November 30, 2013.This would increase the total value of the contract by approximately $6.3 million.</p>

<DESC>Using Recovery Act funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a task order to contract number W91278-07-D-0111, a competitively awarded Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract for Cultural Resources Services for the Mobile District, awarded to Brockington and Associates, 6611 Bay Circle Suite 220, Norcross, Georgia 30071-1225.   This task order will be for Cultural Resources Investigations for Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) River Basin Water Control Manual and EIS, for Alabama, Florida and Georgia.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the task order will be to comply with appropriate cultural resources laws and regulations, and the management and protection of historic properties within the basin.<BR> <BR>The objective of the cultural resources investigations is to comply with statutory laws and regulations that govern Federal responsibilities concerning management and protection of historic properties.  Current work associated with completion of Water Control Manual and EIS for the ACF is to present data that will complete a study of cultural resources of the river basin that includes an inventory of sites along the waterway; a review of regional histories, archeological surveys, and historic properties management plans (HPMPs); and GIS data and update of predictive model on effects of water allocation as satisfaction of regulatory requirements including but not limited to those in the National Historic Preservation Act and 36CFR800 (Protection of Historic Properties).  The results of this study will be incorporated into the EIS and Water Control Manual and will be used to evaluate the potential impacts and effects to cultural resources in the ACF basin.  In the past the evaluations of impacts have focused on three potential effects from changes in water level management: erosion, deposition of sediment, and access.  The studies resulting from this contract will be coordinated with the appropriate SHPO, Tribal representatives and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation by the Government.<BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) The  work to be performed is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions.  2) The incumbent contractor has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost.  3)  They have provided a predictive model for archaeological site information for the original water allocation study within the basin based on the contractors familiarity with the project.  4) This contract enables the work to begin immediately.<BR><BR>The American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and  to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current IDIQ contract to meet its requirements.   This contract was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  <BR>

YOU MUST BE ABLE TO COMMUTE DAILY TO THE PERSONNEL SECURITY BRANCH OFFICE IN WASHINGTON, DC

Description

OPM has delegated the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) authority to conduct personnel security background investigations on prospective ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as periodic reinvestigations on all current employees.  The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information.  Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, the Privacy Act of 1974, Office of Personnel Management regulations, other relevant regulations from the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures.  ATF will provide these regulations to the Contractor.

ATF realizes there is a need to secure the services of persons possessing certain degrees of expertise in the processing of background investigations, including planning, scoping, assigning and reviewing.  To that end, ATF has a need for In-House Special Investigators, hereinafter referred to as contractors.  ATF has established a contract background investigation program to contract these investigations out to trained and experienced investigators.  Operational and administration aspects of the program are also contracted out to trained and experienced investigators or personnel security professionals, typically, though not exclusively, retired federal investigators who have at least 3 years of current experience in the administration of and/or conduct of personnel security background investigations.  Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by ATF.

Contract investigators who are under contract with ATF shall be known as Special Investigators and carry credentials authorizing them to perform such background investigations as the Assistant Director may authorize.  Contractors may also be assigned to assist with other official ATF investigations.

Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them.  Such tasks might include planning assignments, scoping investigations, assigning investigations, reviewing Reports of Investigation (ROI), auditing and adjudicating investigations, completing invoices for payment for the investigation and working on special projects as directed by the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) and/or Branch Chief.  Contractors must be computer literate and efficient in software programs that support email, word processing, and data entry, which are utilized in the administration of the personnel security program.

Contractors duties and work hours are dictated by the ATF workload and funding availability.  Contractors are expected to be available to accept work as requested.  Contractors will be paid at the rate of $56.00 per hour. Hours authorized and worked in excess of 40 hours per week will be paid at the rate of $84.00; the need for additional work hours must be agreed upon and have prior approval from the COTR and/or Branch Chief.  Contractors shall ensure their availability to process needed work in a timely manner.  A minimum of 32 hours per week is required.  Contractors are responsible for providing adequate office coverage with their respective team; to include holiday and high vacation/travel months.  Failure to meet necessary availability may result in termination of the contract. 

In compliance with ATFs specific invoicing procedures, Contractors must submit an invoice for payment detailing the number of hours worked.  Such invoice will be subject to audit by ATF. Contractors must also execute a Contractor Certification that declares that any submission of a Contractors invoice represents actual hours performed in accordance with requirements of the Statement of Work. 

ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services.  This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations.  Consequently contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract.  Contractors are further advised that the third party is required to make payments in the same timely manner as ATF.  

Contractors are responsible for safeguarding information.  Background investigation information is protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 and, unless classified, is considered Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) (also or formerly known as Sensitive but Unclassified information). CUI must not be transmitted via unsecured email or Internet, or disclosed to unauthorized parties.  Contractors must never furnish or divulge CUI contained in an investigation.  Each contractor must make every reasonable effort to protect data associated with a background investigation.  Data, notes, copies of testimonies, copies of ROIs, etc., are the sole property of ATF and must be safeguarded against unlawful disclosure.  

Each contractor shall execute a MOU, attesting to his or her understanding of this section, which, upon execution, will become a permanent part of this contract.  Contractors will have access to ATFs computer network and are required to successfully complete ATF Information System Security Awareness training each year.  Contractors must also complete the following forms: ATF P 7500.1 (Rules of Behavior and Customer Agreement for ATF Workstation Users), ATF F 2030.1 (Personnel Authenticator Locator), ATF F 1710.5 (Request for Media ID), and Social Engineering Certification.  

Identification media, ATF-provided software, and all other Government property must be surrendered when requested by the PSB. 

Each contractor must be able to obtain and maintain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) and receive a Top Secret clearance.  This investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of the PSB, and be performed under such standards as the PSB may establish.  A favorable adjudication of the SSBI must be determined by ATF prior to access to ATF information, information technology systems, and unescorted access to facilities.  Failure to have a background investigation favorably adjudicated SSBI or receive a Top Secret clearance constitutes grounds for disqualification of the contractor.  ATF will conduct an SSBI-Periodic Reinvestigation on contract investigators every five years.

Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  

Contractors must obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and have a current registration in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) for payment via electronic funds transfer. The contractor is responsible for making changes to his/her own information.  Any changes to the contractors name, address, telephone number, company name, tax identification number, or financial institution information must be made by the contractor in the CCR.  The CCR is used to process electronic payment deposits.  It is vital contractors keep their registration current.  In addition, contractors must notify the PSB and the ATF Financial Management Division of any changes so the proper updates can be made to all systems.  

Each contractor, when working in the PSB, must carry themselves in a manner that reflects positively on ATF.  To that end, contractors, when on duty, should present themselves in a professional manner, be neatly groomed, and appropriately attired.  Complaints of inappropriate conduct or performance will be investigated, and if substantiated, may result in the contract being terminated.

Contractors must exhibit professional qualities during all periods of performance and absolute integrity is required and expected.  Contractors must be polite and professional in both conduct and appearance.

Contractors should never use ATF credentials for investigating any matter not assigned to them by ATF, PSB or for any personal gain.  Contractors must not allow their credentials to be photocopied or taken from their possession.  Lost or stolen credentials should be reported to the PSB immediately, as well as the local police department.

ATF intends to issue vendors Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) that will be available for placing calls/orders through September 30, 2010.  The solicitation will close June 8, 2009 at 4 p.m. EST.  All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) contractors.  A BPA will be awarded after all evaluations are passed, tentative selections are made, interviews completed and background investigations adjudicated favorably.  Because ATFs needs are dynamic, ATF anticipates a requirement to periodically re-open this solicitation add new contractors to the pool.  

Vendors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA.  A BPA is not a contract.  A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish and eliminate the need for more complex acquisition methods.  There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity.  All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected vendor, or the call will be transferred to another vendor.  Calls/orders may be competed among all vendors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF representative.  The BPA and the contractors responsibilities thereunder are subject changes in Federal law, regulation and policy, which may include, but are not limited to, procedural changes related to the use of government equipment, security procedures and investigative priorities.  Modifications may be sent to vendors via mail or electronic mail.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 Investigation Services, and is the appropriate designation required by the CCR.

The following clauses are incorporated in full force:  FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror  Commercial Items (Oct. 00)  and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial (incorporated by reference)  Each Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items;  A copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications- can be found on the web at www.arnet.gov/far. The Contractor may request a copy from SIAdministration@atf.gov.  Offeror shall provide a statement proving they have read and understand the term and Conditions set forth in the FAR 52.212-4.

EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.

Capability of the Vendor.

ATF will consider BPAs to vendors, as needed, on a pass/fail basis, based on past performance and experience, and the vendors acceptability (the acceptance of ATF terms and conditions including the hourly rate).  All vendors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor Registration.  These are mandatory requirements and any firm will be eliminated that fails to comply.  Vendors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability.  Vendors rated as passed will be awarded points for past performance and experience.  Vendors with an overall score of at least 68 points and that meet the mandatory requirements will be considered for issuance of a BPA and award will be made to those companies receiving the highest scores.  At least 56 points must come from Offeror Demonstrated Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance and 12 must come from Vendor Capabilities.

A.	Experience/Qualifications/Past Performance (80 Points):  Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing.  A minimum of three years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended.  ATF will evaluate each vendors experience on the basis of its breadth, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting and/or administering personnel security background investigations in the federal environment, as well as computer proficiency.  ATF may assess the vendors communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a vendor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  ATF may contact some of the vendors customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the vendor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the vendors performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the vendor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the vendor was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases.  Contractors with recent ATF experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided to ATF.  ATF will consider performance that contractors have previously rendered to ATF to be more influential than past performance rendered to another source.
(56 points minimum).

B.	Capabilities (20 Points):  Capabilities are the vendors ability to adhere to agency and program requirements. (12 points minimum).

C.	Acceptability: ATF will determine the acceptability of each vendor offer on a pass or fail basis.  A vendors offer is acceptable when it manifests the vendors assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including attachments and amendments (if any).  If a vendor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, ATF will consider its offer to be unacceptable.  Vendors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so.

YOU MUST BE ABLE TO COMMUTE DAILY TO THE PERSONNEL SECURITY BRANCH OFFICE IN WASHINGTON, DC

Description

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has delegated the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) authority to conduct personnel security background investigations on ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as periodic reinvestigations on all current employees.  The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information.  Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, the Privacy Act of 1974, OPM regulations, other relevant regulations from the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures.  ATF will provide these regulations to the In-House Team Lead Special Investigators, hereinafter referred to as contractors.

ATF has established a contract background investigation program to contract these investigations out to trained and experienced investigators.  Operational and administration aspects of the program are also contracted out to trained and experienced investigators or personnel security professionals, typically, though not exclusively, retired Federal investigators who have at least three (3) years of current experience in the administration of and/or conduct of personnel security background investigations.  Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by ATF.

The Personnel Security Branch (PSB) is currently organized into four (4) team sections.  Applicant Team: responsible for conducting background investigations on potential ATF special agents, industry operations investigators, and other ATF personnel.  Contractor Team: responsible for conducting background investigations on potential ATF contractors, student interns, volunteers, summer/winter hires, and other non-ATF personnel.  Employee Team: responsible for conducting periodic reinvestigations on current ATF employees.  Investigations Team: responsible for organizing assignments and reviewing background investigative leads sent to ATF Field Special Investigators.  In addition, the Investigations Team provides guidance and assistance to Special Investigators in the field; they also serve as the authority for investigative coverage requirements.

Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them.  Such tasks include planning assignments, scoping investigations, assigning investigations, reviewing Reports of Investigation (ROI), auditing and adjudicating investigations, reviewing and/or drafting policy and procedures (subject to final approval by ATF), generating status and statistical reports, evaluating and assessing priorities and procedures, and implementing necessary change, disseminating information to team members, team training, coordinating with team assistants, attending team/branch meetings when required, and working on special projects as directed by their Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) and/or Branch Chief. 

Contractors are responsible for organizing their team and maintaining communication with their team and PSB staff and management.  They must have the ability to assess the needs of their team and effectively set goals and priorities to ensure compliance with mandated guidelines and ATF hiring goals.  Contractors will correspond with the COTR and/or Branch Chief prior to initiating new policies/procedures or shifting team priorities.  All policies are subject to final review by ATF.  Contractors should be able to review current standards, make recommendations, and provide written direction.  They are responsible for ensuring adequate training for new/transferred team members and providing any necessary guidance.  Contractors must have the ability to effectively communicate with clear and concise thoughts both verbally and in writing.  While contractors will be responsible for organizing assignments, they will exercise no supervisory authority over any other contractor.  Contractors will not have the authority to discipline, withdraw clearances, issue awards, or represent themselves as supervisory.  The contractors position described in this Statement of Work is managerial in terms of cases, not in terms of personnel.

Contractors duties and work hours are dictated by the ATF workload and funding availability.  Contractors are expected to be available to accept work as requested. Contractors will be paid at the rate of $61.00 per hour for each hour up to and including 40 hours or otherwise established rate as determined by ATF.  Hours authorized and worked in excess of 40 hours per week will be paid at the rate of $91.50; the need for additional work hours must be agreed upon and have prior approval from the COTR and/or Branch Chief.  Contractors shall ensure their availability to process needed work in a timely manner.  Each contactor must work a minimum number of 34 hours; working at a minimum four (4) days each week.  Contractors shall not work more than ten hours per day without prior approval from their COTR and/or Branch Chief.  Contractors schedules are subject to final approval by ATF.  Contractors are responsible for coordinating adequate office coverage for their respective team; to include holidays and high vacation/travel months.  Failure to meet necessary availability may result in termination of the contract.

In compliance with ATFs specific invoicing procedures, Contractors must submit an invoice for payment detailing the number of hours worked.  Such invoice will be subject to audit by ATF. Contractors must also execute a Contractor Certification that declares that any submission of a Contractors invoice represents actual hours performed in accordance with requirements of the Statement of Work.  ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services.  This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations.  Consequently contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract.  Contractors are further advised that the third party is required to make payments in the same timely manner as ATF.  

Contractors must be computer literate and efficient in software programs that support e-mail, word processing, and data entry, which are utilized in the administration of the personnel security program.

Contractors must be willing to attend periodic conferences at selected locations within the United States.  Conferences are usually limited to one (1) per year.  

Contractors will have access to ATFs computer network and will sign ATF P 7500.1, ATF Rules of Behavior and Customer Agreement for ATF Workstation Users.  Contractors are required to successfully complete ATF Information System Security Awareness training each year.  Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  

Each contractor shall undergo a personnel security investigation to determine their suitability to access ATF facilities, proprietary information, and/or data.  This investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of the Personnel Security Branch (PSB), and be performed under such standards as the PSB may establish.  Each contractor must be able to obtain and maintain a favorably adjudicated background investigation and receive a Top Secret clearance.  The contractor is advised that this investigation may take 90 days or more to complete, depending upon the complexities of the issues.

Failure to timely complete the required background forms, or failure to have a background investigation favorably adjudicated or receive a Top Secret clearance constitutes grounds for disqualification of the contractor.  Should the contractor be disqualified, he or she will not be granted unescorted access to any ATF facility, and access to ATF proprietary information or information technology systems will not be authorized.

Each contractor, when working in the PSB, must carry themselves in a manner that does not contribute to ATF being portrayed in a negative light.  To that end, contractors, when on duty, should present themselves in a professional manner, be neatly groomed, and appropriately attired.  Complaints of inappropriate conduct or performance will be investigated, and if substantiated, may result in the contract being terminated.  

Contractors must exhibit professional qualities during all periods of performance and absolute integrity is required and expected.  Contractors must be polite and professional in both conduct and appearance. 

Contractors should never use ATF credentials for investigating any matter not assigned to you by ATF, PSB or for any personal gain.  Contractors must not allow their credentials to be photocopied or taken from their possession.  Lost or stolen credentials should be reported to the PSB immediately, as well as the local police department. 

Contractors are responsible for safeguarding information.  Background investigation information is protected by the Privacy Act and, unless classified, is considered Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) information.  SBU information must not be transmitted via unsecured e-mail or Internet, or disclosed to unauthorized parties.  Contractors must never furnish or divulge SBU information contained a background investigation record.

Contractors must obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and have a current registration in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) for payment via electronic funds transfer. 

ATF intends to issue contractors Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) that will be available for placing calls/orders through June 30, 2013.  The solicitation will close June 8, 2009 at 
4 p.m. EST.  All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) contractors.  A BPA will be awarded after all evaluations are passed, tentative selections are made, interviews completed and background investigations adjudicated favorably.  ATF anticipates a requirement to periodically re-open this solicitation due to attrition.  

Contractors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA.  A BPA is not a contract.  A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected contractors are in a position to furnish, and eliminates the need for more complex acquisition methods.  There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity.  All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected contractor, or the call will be transferred to another contractor.  Calls/orders may be competed among all contractors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF representative.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 Investigation Services, and is the appropriate designation required by the CCR.

The following clauses are incorporated in full force:  FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror  Commercial Items (Oct. 00)  and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial (incorporated by reference)  Each Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items;  A copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications- can be found on the web at www.arnet.gov/far - or the contractor may request a copy from SIAdministration@atf.gov.

All vendors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor Registration.  Any contractor failing to comply with these mandatory requirements will be eliminated.  Contractors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability.  Contractors rated as passed will be awarded points for past performance and experience.  Contractors with an overall score of at least 75 points and that meet the mandatory requirements will be considered for issuance of a BPA and award will be made to those contractors receiving the highest scores if a position is available.  At least 45 points must come from Offer or Demonstrated Experience / Qualifications and at least 30 points must come from Contractor Past Performance / Capabilities.


a. Experience/Qualifications (60 Points):  Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing.  A minimum of three (3) years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended.  ATF will evaluate each contractors experience on the basis of its breadth, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting and/or administering personnel security background investigations in the Federal environment, as well as computer proficiency.  ATF may assess the contractors communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. (45 points minimum).

b. Past Performance/Capabilities (40 Points):  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a contractor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  ATF may contact some of the contractors customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the contractor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the contractors performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the contractor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the contractor was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases. (30 points minimum).

Contractors with recent ATF experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided to ATF.  ATF will consider performance that contractors have previously rendered to ATF to be more influential than past performance rendered to another source.

c.  Acceptability.  ATF will determine the acceptability of each contractor offer on a pass or fail basis.  A contractors offer is acceptable when it manifests the contractors assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including attachments and amendments (if any).  If a contractor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, ATF will consider its offer to be unacceptable.  Contractors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so.

4.7.2.2 Risk Level

In general, services performed by Contractor personnel may fall within three (3) risk categories as described below:

High Risk Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for exceptionally serious impact involving duties especially critical to the DOJ or a program mission with broad scope of policy or program authority, such as:


 Policy development or implementation

 Higher-level management assignment

 Independent spokespersons or non-management positions with authority for independent action,

 Significant fiduciary and procurement authority and responsibilities, and 

 IT-computer positions responsible for the planning, and implementation of a computer security program; the direction, planning and design of a computer system, including the hardware and software; or, accessing a system during the operation or maintenance in such a way, with relatively High Risk to cause grave damage or realizing significant personal gain. (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, for those computer positions that are High Risk at www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a130/a130appendix_iii.html).

Moderate Risk - Are those sensitive positions that have the potential for moderate to serious impact involving duties very important to the DOJ or program mission with significant program responsibilities and delivery of client services to the public, such as:

 Assistance to policy development and implementation,

 Mid-level management assignments,

 Non-management positions with authority for independent or semi-independent action,

 Delivery of service positions that demand public confidence or trust,

 IT-computer positions of a lesser degree of risk that required for High Risk positions (Refer to Appendix III, OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, for those computer positions that are other than High Risk.).

Low Risk (Non-sensitive) - Are those non-sensitive positions that do not fall into any of the above categories and include those positions with potential for impact involving duties of limited relation to the DOJ mission.

4.7.2.3 Types and Numbers of Background Investigations

Work performed under this BPA will fall within one or more of the risk categories defined paragraph 4.7.2.2. As a result, the Contractor's personnel must undergo a background investigation commensurate with the assessed risk category. In addition, before the issuance of any calls for additional personnel, the COTR, the exact number and types of background investigations required for all Contractor positions hired under this BPA.

The Contractor will not be permitted to commence performance under the BPA until a sufficient number of its personnel, as determined by the COTR received requisite background investigations or approved pre-appointment background investigation waivers.

During the life of the BPA, the Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor or Subcontractor employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of written authorization from the Contracting Officer or the COTR.

4.7.2.4 Pre-Appointment Background Investigations and Waivers

Background investigations must be conducted and favorably adjudicated for each contract employee prior to commencing work on this task order. However, where programmatic needs do not permit the Government to wait for completion of the entire background investigation, the SPM, in consultation with the COTR, can grant a pre-appointment background investigation waiver. The extent of the background investigation and/or the information needed to waive the background investigation will vary depending upon the Risk Category associated with each position. A waiver will be revoked if the resulting investigation uncovers derogatory information that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor. When derogatory information has been discovered that cannot be resolved in the contract employees favor, the employee should be removed from the contract. Minimum pre-appointment investigative requirements are listed below. 

High Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be an LBI (Limited Background Investigation) consisting of a personal subject interview, NAC, credit history check, written inquiries and record searches covering 5 years, and personal interviews covering specific areas during the most recent 3 years. Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a successful National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check, vouchering of previous 2 employers and a favorable review of forms submitted.

Moderate Risk Positions. The background investigation shall be a NACI (National Agency Check and Inquiries) consisting of a NAC, written inquiries, and record searches covering specific areas of a subjects background during the past 5 years. Pre-appointment waivers may be granted following a favorable NCIC check and a favorable review of forms submitted.

4.7.2.6 Procedures for Pre-Screening Applicants and Investigations

Contractors Responsibility - The Contractor must determine whether the conduct of the person being considered for assignment on this contract indicates a potential for behavior which would interfere with, prevent, or otherwise impact adversely on: 1) the position to be filled by applicant; 2) the performance of the duties and responsibilities of others on the BPA or in the Government; or 3) the ability of the employing agency to effectively carry out its mandated responsibilities. If the Contractor determines that employing an applicant will not promote the efficiency of this BPA, the applicant must be disqualified from assignment on the BPA. In this regard, the Contractor shall be responsible for performing the following pre-screening and investigative duties for all persons proposed for work under this BPA:

(a) Furnish to each proposed Contractor employee the forms described in Section 5 and ensure that adequate instructions for completing the forms are provided to each applicant. 

(b) Ensure that applicants obtain two (2) complete sets of their fingerprints on the prescribed Form FD-258 from an organization qualified to take fingerprints.

(d) Submit completed forms to the COTR by no later than seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the blank forms.

4.7.2.7 Contractor Status under the National Industrial Security Program (NISP)

Companies participating in the National Security Program (NISP) are required the meet certain federal standards for the investigation of facilities and employees. If the Contractor is a registered in the NISP, investigation initiated by the Department may not be required. The COTR should determine if the Contractor is registered in the NISP, then the facility clearance level held by the Contractor, and if individuals selected to work for the Department were previously investigated in accordance with NISP procedures. If an individual selected to work for the Department was previously investigated within the last 12 months, the COTR will obtain a copy of the Letter of Consent (LOC) issued by the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO). 

4.7.2.8 Factors for Suitability Determinations. The Department of Justice uses several basic factors in making suitability determinations for contract employees. This information is intended as a guide for the Contractor during their screening process and is not inclusive of all disqualifying situations.

Disqualifying Factors The following conduct factors, as disclosed on the SF-85P and the SF-85P-S, in a written statement or personal interview with the applicant, or established during a reference check may disqualify an applicant from employment on a DOJ contract. Contractors should be aware such individuals may not be able to work for the Department under the BPA.

Criminal Behavior (e.g., a conviction resulting from a serious felony -- murder, rape, armed robbery, etc. -- regardless of when the conviction occurred; a felony conviction, notwithstanding the severity of the crime, within the previous seven (7) years; a period of incarceration as a result of a felony conviction within the previous seven (7) years; or pending indictments or criminal charges)

Infamous or disgraceful conduct (e.g., sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted, or bizarre behavior indicating depravity)

Improper or illegal involvement with drugs within the past 7 years.

Current and continuing alcohol abuse

Intentional false statement, deception, fraud in appointment (e.g., altering the condition of discharge on military discharge documents, altering college transcripts, falsely completing the SF-85P or SF-85P-S, etc.)

Financial considerations (e.g., deceptive or illegal financial practices; continuing inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; financial problems linked to such dependencies on alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc.)

Non-U.S. Citizenship (e.g. non-legal residents; recent legal residents, residing in the U.S. less than four years; non-U.S. citizens maintaining citizenship in "hostile" countries)

Questionable Allegiance to the United States (e.g., membership in organizations or association with individuals advocating violence or overthrow of the U.S. government or involvement in any act of sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition)

Emotional, mental, and personality disorders (when a credentialed mental health professional acceptable to the government has determined that the individual has a condition or treatment that may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability or stability or could physically harm him/herself or others)

Previous security violations (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of classified information or deliberate or multiple violations)

Misuse of information technology systems (e.g. illegal or unauthorized entry into or illegal, unauthorized, or improper use of an information technology system) 

Foreign Influence (e.g. when an individuals immediate family, including co-habitants and other who the individual is bound by close ties or affection, is not a U.S. citizen and may be subject to coercion and/or duress)

Foreign Preference (e.g. and individuals behavior indicates a preference for a foreign country over the United States)

4.7.2.9 Mitigating Factors When questionable conduct is disclosed, the following factors should be considered as to whether or not disqualification of an individual for work in the Department is warranted. The decision is made on a case-by-case basis, and is subject to review by the assigned Security Officer, in consultation with the COTR.

(a) The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct.

(b) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation.

(c) The frequency and recency of the conduct.

(d) The individuals age and maturity at the time of the conduct.

(e) The voluntaries of participation.

(f) The presence or absence of rehabilitation, resolution, and other pertinent behavioral 
changes.

(g) The motivation for the conduct.

(h) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress.

(i) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

4.7.2.10 Given the above guidelines for determining suitability, the Contractor should be able to determine, without DOJ involvement, which applicants are unsuitable for employment under this contract. However, additional questions and requests for information may result from review of the security packages by DOJ personnel. In the event the Department or the contractor has reasonable cause to believe that an employee under the BPA falls under any of the eleven mandatory disqualification factors listed above, the employee must be removed from this BPA. In addition, all contract employees are expected to adhere to the Department's Standards of Conduct.

4.7.2.11 The COTR will notify the Contractor of the results of background investigations as they are completed and adjudicated. The COTR will also notify the Contractor of any applicants who are found ineligible for employment under this contract so that the Contractor can immediately recruit and initiate paperwork to clear replacement applicants. If a contract employee is already working on the BPA and is determined to be ineligible, he or she will be removed from the call order.

4.7.212 The COTR will notify the Contracting Officer when a sufficient number of Contractor employees have received employment security approvals or pre-appointment waivers approvals. Upon receipt of this information and any other information, which may be required elsewhere in the BPA, the Contracting Officer will issue the Contractor a Notice to Proceed, which permits the commencement of work under the call(s).

4.7.2.13 The Contractor shall ensure no contract or subcontract employee commences performance hereunder prior to receipt of a written authorization from the Contracting Officer.

4.7.2.14 The Contractor shall make every effort to preclude incurrence of costs by the Government for security investigations for replacement of employees, and in so doing shall ensure otherwise satisfactory and physically able employees assigned hereunder remain in contract performance for at least one year. The Contractor shall take all necessary steps to assure contract or subcontract personnel selected for assignment to this contract are professionally qualified and personally reliable, of reputable background and sound character, and meet all other requirements stipulated herein. The fact the Government performs security investigations shall not in any manner relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to ensure that all personnel furnished are reliable and of reputable background and sound character. Should a security investigation conducted by the Government render ineligible a Contractor-furnished employee, the Contracting Officer will investigate the cause and determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibility to make every effort to select reliable employees of reputable background and sound character. Should there be a need to replace a contract or subcontract employee due to non-performance, the Contracting Officer will determine whether the Contractor has abdicated his responsibilities to make every effort to select trained and experienced employees.

4.7.2.15 Should the Contracting Officer determine the Contractor has failed to comply with the terms of paragraph above, the Contractor may be held monetarily responsible, at a minimum, for all reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the Government to (a) provide coverage (performance) through assignment of individuals employed by the Government or third parties in those cases where absence of contract personnel would cause either a security threat or DOJ program disruption, and (b) conduct security investigations in excess of those which would otherwise be required. 

4.7.2.16 Nothing in this clause shall require the Contractor to bear costs involved in the conduct of security investigations for replacement of an employee who becomes deceased or severely ill for a long period of time.

4.7.2.17 Under no circumstances shall the Contractor fail to comply with the terms and conditions set forth herein without assuming liability for such failure as may be established pursuant to this clause. The rights and remedies conferred upon the Government by this clause are in addition to all and other rights and remedies specified elsewhere in this contract or established by law.

4.7.3 Protection of Grand Jury Information

4.7.3.1 Grand jury testimony is sensitive Limited Official Use information, which must be protected against disclosure to unauthorized personnel. Pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures, disclosures of matters occurring before the grand jury other than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may be made available to the attorneys for the Government to use in the performance of their duties. Otherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter, stenographer, or operator of a recorded testimony may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only when so directed by the court.

4.7.3.2 It shall be the duty of the Official Reporter to safeguard all materials relating to grand jury hearings, which are in his/her possession and/or under his/her custody.

4.7.4 Contractor Physical Security Requirements

4.7.4.1 Contractor employees assigned to work areas where Grand Jury information is processed, stored, or transcribed must challenge the presence of any unknown or unauthorized person. The need-to-know principle shall be adhered to at all times within the closed area. When the materials are not stored in security containers or vaults, and when in actual use by authorized personnel, they shall be protected as follows: 
o Kept under constant surveillance by an authorized person who is in a physical position to exercise direct security controls over the material. 
o Covered, turned face down, placed in storage containers, or otherwise protected when unauthorized persons are present. 
o The room containing the materials must be locked when vacated for short periods of time. 
o Returned to storage containers as soon as practicable after use. Grand jury material shall not be removed from the premises of the court reporter for transcription except for delivery to the USAOs. Approved storage containers include: the GSA Class 6 security container; a lock-bar file cabinet (with a GSA approved lock); or 3-position dial safe. 

4.7.4.2 An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) must be installed connected to a central station at the Contractors facility or the facility of a subcontractor who monitor the IDS and guard or law enforcement response to the Grand Jury processing area must occur within 15 minutes of alarm activation. Central station burglar alarm systems classified by the Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. or other systems with built-in auxiliary power for fail safe protection, shall satisfy this requirement. (Such system shall not use shunt switches to shut off control panels and all alarm sensors and control boxes should be equipped with tamper-proof switches). A direct-connect or remote station alarm system (i.e., a system connected by direct wire to alarm receiving equipment located in a local police department headquarters, which is activated and deactivated by the using Contractor and responded to by personnel of the local police department) may be utilized. If the contracting firm is housed in a building with a 24 hour guard service, the IDS requirement may be waived. The representative of the Contractor shall be required to report immediately to the facility to ascertain the nature of the alarm and to take appropriate measures to ensure the security of area concerned. 

4.7.4.3 End-of-day security checks shall be performed within the contract facility to ensure that precautions are taken to protect grand jury material. The court reporter firm shall designate an individual or individuals, to make daily checks to ensure all grand jury material has been properly stored. This can be the Grand Jury Court Reporter personnel, or another individual who has been granted security approval by the EOUSA SPS.

4.7.4.4 The Contracting Officer or his/her authorized representative, of the USAO, shall have the right to inspect at reasonable intervals, but at least annually, the procedures, equipment, and facilities used by the Contractor to comply with these requirements.

4.7.4.5 If the contractor is unable to provide the required physical security in his/her workplace, a work area and storage space for Grand Jury transcript processing will be provided at the USAO.

4.7.5 Information Technology

4.7.5.1 Information Technology Equipment refers to computers, steno machines, transcription devices, printers, scanners, and all other technological devices used to electronically process grand jury information for the USAO.

4.7.5.2 When grand jury court reporters process grand jury information outside the USAO while utilizing Information Technology equipment that is not the property of the USAO, the equipment will be used in a dedicated, stand-alone, single user mode (no network capability). The information must be unclassified. All processing must be done on removable storage media (floppy disks, CDs, removable hard drives, cartridges). Removable storage media must be marked "Grand Jury Information." When marking the media, no acronyms should be used. 

4.7.5.3 In addition, any Information Technology equipment used to process USAO information may be subject to certification/accreditation and/or disk-based sanitization to protect grand jury information. As a general rule, grand jury court reporters may not use personally-owned PCs and equipment to process grand jury information. Personally-owned PCs and equipment are those devices the grand jury court reporter uses to conduct personal projects related to obligations, affairs, assets, or life of the operator.

4.7.5.4 When grand jury court reporter owned PCs are used, and/or have fixed hard drives, and the PC is also used for transcription work outside of the USAO, the equipment must have the ability to download to USAO equipment or storage media. In addition, temporary files must be deleted from the grand jury court reporters equipment using the currently approved USAO sanitization method. 


4.7.5.5 Access to information technology equipment must be controlled and restricted to personnel authorized to handle grand jury information and having appropriate access approval. Unauthorized personnel must not be permitted to view any grand jury information. The equipment must be turned off, or otherwise disabled, when not in use.

4.7.5.6 The removable media must be stored in an approved security container or lockable file cabinet (in accordance with 6.C.1) after normal working hours or when the equipment is not in use. 

4.7.5.7 All printed output material must be protected. USAO personnel must ensure this requirement is adhered to and documented in the Grand Jury Inspection Reports. 

4.7.5.8 Only appropriately-cleared maintenance personnel escorted and monitored by USAO personnel or court reporter service personnel are allowed to perform on-site maintenance for the equipment. The USAO must grant approval before maintenance of the PC is allowed. The storage media must be removed from the PC prior to removal of the PC from the area for maintenance. 

4.7.5.9 Grand jury information should be backed up on a weekly basis. Grand jury information may not be processed by individuals outside of those contracted and granted security approval.

The specification.
(t) Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Governments reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to:
(A) Change the name in the CCR database; 
(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;
(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

(End of Clause)
SECTION D. ATTACHMENTS

D.1 Contractor Residency Requirement Information

All Contractor employees assigned to this contract and working within the United States shall meet the DOJ Residency Requirement. The Residency Requirement states that, for three of the five years immediately prior to applying for a position, the individual must have: 1) resided in the United States; 2) worked for the United States overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or 3) be a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.

This requirement can be waived for short-term (i.e., those employees performing duties for a cumulative total of 14 days or less) if there is a critical need for their specialized or unique skills (for example, interpreters for rare foreign languages). These individuals must be United States citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens. A waiver request from the head of the Component outlining the extenuating circumstances along with the requisite Contractor clearance package shall be submitted through the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) to the Department Security Officer (DSO) for approval. Each waiver request will be reviewed by the DSO and a determination made on a case-by-case basis.

Additionally, a Contractor employee who is not a U.S. citizen must be from a country allied with the United States. Since the countries on the Allied Countries List are subject to change, the head of the Component shall review the following website for current information: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/Citizen.htm.


D. 2 Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza or other National Emergency 

Continuing Contract Performance During a Pandemic Influenza
or other National Emergency

During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation. 

The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: 

 Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service. 

 Contractors should cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. 

 Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency. 

 Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. 

 Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. 

 Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. 

 With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Contract Security requirements must be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. 

 Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. 

 Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.

 Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. 

 Identify how time and attendance will be maintained. 

It is the contractors responsibility to advise the government contracting officer or COTR if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the contracting officer, COTR or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractors notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. 

The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance Emergency Acquisitions, May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2 Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.




SECTION E. SOLICITATION PROVISIONS


E.1	52.212-1  Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items.

As prescribed in 12.301(b)(1), insert the following provision:
Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items (Jun 2008)
(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.
(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show 
(1) The solicitation number;
(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;
(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;
(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;
(5) Terms of any express warranty;
(6) Price and any discount terms;
(7) Remit to address, if different than mailing address;
(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);
(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;
(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and
(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
I Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the senders request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
(2)
(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Governments control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
I If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
     Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

The riser shelf should be 15" high x 12" deep x 84" long with a full back panel, 7 electrical outlets spread evenly under the shelf against the back panel and end stops along the back and both sides of the shelf.<br />-------------<br />Will you accept an open door, non-locking TV cabinet for the Conference area?</p>
<p>- No. We must have a lockable TV cabinet to deter theft of electronics.<br />--------------<br />Was it determined if the pedestals need to be keyed to have the same key number per each person's station or is random keying okay meaning others may have the same key number in the pedestals?</p>
<p>- Each desk/workstation must be keyed to have the same key number per person's station/desk.<br />--------------<br />There is a discrepancy in the furniture list. The APG room has listed 5 desks, but only 4 high back chairs, is this done intentionally? If not, please specify the correct number of chairs and desks.</p>
<p>- The APG office should have 5 desks and 5 high back chairs.</p>
<p>*** The attached furniture list has been edited to reflect this change.<br />-------------<br />Also Note: There was some confusion regarding the "U-Shaped" Conference Table. At the site visit, the customer specified that he wanted a "U-Shaped" table with either a rounded or an angled edge. The customer did not want three rectangular tables put together to resemble a "U-Shape."</p>
<p>For clarification purposes I've attached a sketch of the type of "U-shaped" table that the customer had in mind. Please note that the sketch is not drawn to scale and is meant only as an approximation.</p>
<p>Amendment 4: The response deadline for this solicitation has been extended to Monday 08 June 2009 at 12:00 pm PDT, in order to allow for enough time to answer all the questions that were asked.</p>
<p>Amendment 3: The response deadline has been extended to Tuesday 26 May 2009&nbsp;at 12:00 pm PDT.&nbsp; The following changes were also made to the attached furniture list: The microwave hutches are no longer needed and were thus removed from the list.</p>
<p>Amendment 2: Changes have been made to the attached furniture list.&nbsp; All previous copies of the furniture list are now obsolete.&nbsp; For the most current furniture list, view the attachment titled "Furniture List Edited 7 May 2009."&nbsp; The requested changes to the furniture list are marked in red.</p>
<p>Amendment 1: Questions and Answers<br />1. Is there an onsite dumpster for trash? No<br />2. Does Nellis AFB have cardboard recycling and will they stage a dumpster for the install? No<br />Note: The contractor is responsible for disposing of any cardboard/trash as a result of the furniture installation.<br />3. How many floors are in the building? 2 floors<br />4. Is there an elevator? Yes, there is a passenger elevator.<br />5. Are working hours standard 8-5 (for installation)? Yes, installation shall be done within standard working hours (between 8:00 am and 5:00 pm).<br />6. Is there existing furniture to work around, or that has to be moved? No<br />7. Will added features or benefits be looked at as favorable? Award will be made based on Lowest Price and Delivery Schedule (I cannot award to a contractor that offers added features for a higher price, if there is a lower bidder that meets all the requirements within the solicitation).<br />8.

Where can I obtain the FEMA fuel tank spec to ensure our FEMA specs are up to date?
 
Answer:  The generator shall be equipped with a UL142 double-walled sub-base and vented, integrated fuel tank of sufficient capacity as to hold a 12hr supply of fuel for the generator to which it is affixed.  This is different that the 24hr specification required in the continental US.  The tank must include two 4x10 .250 fork pockets spaced based on the generators center of gravity at not more than 77 inches apart.  Furthermore, the generator shall also be equipped with all lines and fittings necessary to properly connect the generator to the fuel tank, as well as hydraulic quick-disconnect couplers installed on both fuel supply and return lines to facilitate the use of external fuel caddies during maintenance operations.  A photo of a similar machine already on-hand is attached.
Q.  Are the generators both standbys or portable?
Answer: The word both in the question implies the request is for two generators; the request is for only a single machine.  The single generator being requested is a portable MQ Power brand 400kva generator with the specification outlined in the request.
Q.  Do they need transfer switches?
Answer: No
Q.  How much amperage feed into the building?
Answer: The amperage requirements are the amperage capabilities of the requested brand and model generator.  This question presumes the machine is being purchased for a specific building; it is not.<BR><BR>

(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organizations programmatic goals and objectives.  

Stabilization programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States governments top priorities. This program will actively work to support counterinsurgency operations, development in crisis prone areas of the country, and the Afghan government.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/.

INTRODUCTION

USAID/OTI plans to launch a new program in Afghanistan, in line with US Government priorities.  The program will implement civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, primarily during the clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations.  The program will seek to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects.  In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.  

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above.  It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc.  Small livelihood activities may be considered if it is clear they have the full support of the community, and will benefit the community as a whole.

OBJECTIVE

The objective for hiring this position is to support OTI Program staff in Afghanistan.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

The Field Operations and Project Manager is a member of the DCHA/OTI Asia/Middle East (AME) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative, and is based in Kabul, Afghanistan, with frequent temporary duty (TDY) travel to the field.

Second, s/he will coordinate OTIs role within the Afghan Civilian Assistance Program (ACAP), which seeks to aid Afghan civilians affected by death, injury and/or physical destruction resulting from operations in which international military forces were involved.  Each task will take up approximately 50% of the incumbents workload.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>SYNOPSIS: Project ZHTV0700191. This RESTRICTED ACQUISITION is set aside for HUBzone concerns. The  Period of Performance is 300 days.

NAICS CODE: 236220. Size Standard $33.5M  Renovate Facility Phase 1, Facility 20011.  This project is phase I of a multi-phase whole building renovation plan. This phase includes complete replacement of all air handling units, the heat exchanger, electrical distribution switchboard and circuit breakers.  All restrooms will be completely replaced, some in different locations than the existing.  A new sanitary sewer line will be installed.  The site of the work is Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.

Special Requirement/Considerations: The building will remain occupied during this construction. Many of the new utility lines will be above the ceiling in the corridor requiring the contractor to plan his work to meet fire safety requirements for egress.  The air handler and associated ductwork replacement will need to be accomplished during the no heat/no cool time of the year requiring the contractor to plan ahead to have all his material on the site before he begins demolition.  The restroom work will be phased to allow the occupants to have access to at least one working restroom at all times during the construction. All this phasing of work will require the contractor to be able to manage multiple disciplines in order to minimize detrimental effects to building occupants.  Constant communication with the building occupants and the fire department will be critical.  The main occupants of this building are Air Force lawyers and the OSI.  An unscheduled power outage could cause a mission impact for these organizations and therefore is unacceptable.

Estimated Cost of proposed Acquisition is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.

 In accordance with FAR 4.1102 and DFARS 252.204-704 "Required Central Contractor Registration," Contractor must be registered in CCR prior to award. Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov/ , or 1-888-CCR-2423 Fax: 1-703-696-0213.

<p>The Acquisition and Contracting Division (AFCEE/AC), Brooks City-Base Texas, in support of the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE) is conducting an acquisition for the Environmental, Construction and Operations &amp; Services 2009 (ECOS09) program. This is a source selection for environmental, construction and operations and services at sites located primarily on DoD (mostly Air Force) installations worldwide with an emphasis on CONUS, for which AFCEE customers have responsibility. ECOS09 is 100% small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Requirements under this contract will primarily support environmental restoration/remediation and operations/services efforts; but requirements may also include traditional minor construction, demolition, and repair. Stand-alone design and conceptual work plan/implementation work plan (CWP/IWP) are NOT included in the scope of this contract. Requirements shall be carried out as specified under TOs at locations worldwide, with emphasis on the Continental United States (CONUS). This is a follow-on contract to the current ECOS contract and is critical to meet AFCEE's future mission and anticipated workload.</p>
<p>Source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR Supplements. The contracts are contemplated to be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) pricing arrangements. This requirement is a small business set-aside consisting of approximately five (5) to eight (8) awards and will have a ceiling of $350M. The Government reserves the right to make fewer, more or no contracts based on the quality and quantity of the proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 562910 (500 employees or less). This size standard applies for establishment of eligibility as a small business.</p>
<p>Excess bonding capacity is $2.5M. Contract Fair Opportunity Selection and Ordering Procedure clauses will be used to compete task orders against the successful offerors. Terms of contract(s) include a five year ordering period plus two additional years for performance.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates releasing the RFP on or about 14 November 2008. The RFP will be issued via FedBizOpps and posted on the AFCEE ECOS09 website, located at https://www.afceeprivweb.brooks.af.mil/pkv/ecos09/default.asp. All contractors interested in receiving information on this acquisition are encouraged to register with the FedBizOpps website as well as the AFCEE ECOS09 website listed above. Note: Only small business firms can register on the ECOS09 website as interested primes.</p>
<p>No hard copies of this solicitation will be issued. All proposals must be received by the due date and time specified in the RFP. The due date will be no less than 30 calendar days after the release of the RFP. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the RFP for the actual issuance date, proposal due date/time, and delivery address.

<DESC>SIR DTFAWA-09-R-AE000
This amendment provides clarification to Offeror questions. See attached file DTFAWA-09-R-AE000 Admendment 1.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is soliciting competitive proposals to provide Architect and Engineer (A-E) design services for the FAA's EnRoute Facilities Planning and Modernization Program. This program supports En Route Air Traffic operations and service level availability through facility life cycle program management of the 21 Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs), the Combined En Route Radar Approach Control Facilities (CERAPs) at San Juan and Guam and other FAA owned, operated, or sponsored facilities. These design services are detailed in the attached Screening Information Request (SIR) DTFAWA-09-R-AE000, to include all attachments. 
The FAA anticipates an award of an Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a five (5) year base period and at the FAA's discretion two- two year option periods.   
Offers, submitted in response to this Screening Information Request (SIR) will be evaluated in two phases with the most highly competitive proposals advancing to Phase II. This approach and all other Offerror submission requirements are in Section L. 
All questions/inquires must be provided via email to Dave Keehan at dave.keehan@faa.gov no later than May 28, 2009.  Offeror responses, in accordance with DTFAWA-09-R-AE000 Section L, are due at FAA Headquarters Office in Washington DC no later than June 8, 2009, 1 PM (EDT).  
Offerors are advised that a potential organization conflict of interest (OCI) may exist if the successful Offeror develops work products for this A-E contract and then was awarded the construction that resulted from these work products. Therefore, the successful Offeror will not be awarded any construction effort where the design was developed via this contract. 
The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to this solicitation.  Therefore any cost associated with responding to this announcement is solely at the Offeror's expense.
Prospective Offerors are hereby on notice that any amendment(s) issued to this solicitation will be published at http://faaco.faa.gov/ under the current announcements for the FAA Headquarters. It is the Offeror's responsibility to visit this website frequently for updates on this procurement.

<p><br />The Phase II 100% Contract Documents completed by an architectural engineering firm in 2007; were reviewed and checked by the NIH; but because of funding issues the project did not go to bid or construction. Some reprogramming and redesign of the spaces will be required because of changes in some user assignments. These existing Phase II Contract Documents also need to be reviewed for conformance to the most recent NIH Design Guidelines and will require some additional revisions to comply with the ARRA for Energy Efficient Buildings and Sustainable Design and Construction requirements.</p>

<p>The Government intends to negotiate a GMP utilizing the approved existing 100% construction documents. These existing 100% documents will be issued with the solicitation to allow the Offeror to price their general requirements and fee for the Pre-Construction and Construction phases.</p>
<p>The Government plans to construct the project in two stages</p>
<p>Upon successful negotiation of a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) Proposal, construction documents will be issued for the construction of Phase One.</p>
<p>Stage I - Site and Foundations: This phase / bid package will include all site civil work and all site utility work as well as the construction of all foundations (including any basements) the superstructure and the total enclosure including the roof.</p>
<p>In addition, there may be a need to break out portions of the design and construction to allow for advanced procurement of long lead items.</p>
<p>During the Stage I construction period the interior spaces will be reprogrammed and redesigned by the NIH and the A/E firm as required and additional revisions to comply with ARRA stimulus funding sustainability and energy efficiency requirements will be added.</p>
<p>At the completion of this redesign phase, construction documents will be issued for the construction of Phase Two. The CMc will adjust and NIH will negotiate the GMP as required to accommodate these revisions and additions.</p>
<p>Stage II - The second stage will include the completion of the extent of the facility: This phase / bid package will include all major systems; including vertical transportation, all the utility systems to points of use, all central communications infrastructure, the scientific cabinetry, fixed equipment and all the interior fit out finishes, commissioning, start up, final site work / landscaping and project close out.</p>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 561621   This amendment was necessary to provide clarification to the following questions posted by potential quoters.
Question 1 :  Please specify the size of the hatch required in the elevator lobby.  Does it need to be a locking type?
Answer 1:  The IP receiver and computer CPU should be mounted on the rear of each monitor displays to be placed in the elevator lobby area.  A hatch to accommodate the mounting of these items in the ceiling would not be applicable to this mount location.
LOCATION #1   CAFETERIA
Question 2:  We are putting the equipment above the ceiling on a shelf.  I wanted to know if any of the equipment needs to be controlled with an IR remote control?
Answer 2:  Yes, the IP Receiver does have a remote control.
Question 3:  Will power be installed above the ceiling for the equipment?
Answer 3:  A meeting will be held with the awardee of this contract and with the electrician who has been hired to accommodate the electrical and cabling connections for this work, representatives from EPA and a representative from building's management is required to meet prior to the initiation of all work.  This pre-meeting will allow the coordination of work and to address issues such as the placement of electrical outlets to accommodate the requirements of this procurement.
Question 4:  In regards to the panel that you spec'ed, does it need two VGA inputs, because at the cafeteria location you have an optional laptop and video connection.  Do you want a switch or does it have to be done through the panel?
Answer 4:  A switch would be preferred.

Two of the new requirements prescribe limits for meals and refreshments served at breaks.</p>
<p>Regarding meals, the new guideline states that the cost of any meal provided, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 150 percent of the locality M&amp;IE per meal. For example, if breakfast is provided, in a locality with a $54.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the breakfast rate in the locality is $10.00 per breakfast. Therefore, the cost of the breakfast provided at the conference cannot exceed $15.00 ($10.00 X 150%) per person. If lunch will be provided in a locality with a $54.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the lunch rate in the locality is $15.00 per lunch.

<p>The new guideline defines refreshments as light food and drinks served at breaks and include such items as coffee, tea, milk, juice, soft drinks, donuts, bagels, fruit, pretzels, cookies, chips, or muffins.

For the Cleveland, OH area, the M&amp;IE rate is $54.00 per person. Therefore, the cost of the refreshments cannot exceed $12.42 ($54.00 X 23%) per person per day.</p>
<p>Any hotel source interested and capable of providing lodging at the Federal per diem rates and meeting the new guideline requirements should submit a statement of capabilities, to include sleeping and meeting capacity, floor charts, and food and beverage menus, to the point of contact identified.

<DESC>Synopsis:

The United States Agency for International Development in Jordan (USAID/Jordan) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a five-year Cost Plus Fixed Fee Term contract to provide an overarching framework to support the implementation of and capacity building for the development of Alliances and Public Private Partnerships (APPPs).  U.S. interests lie in creating a fully liberalized economy through pro-private sector policies that create a level playing field for entrepreneurs.  The program will support this goal, as well as provide the next step for the Government of Jordan (GOJ) as it completes its goals under privatization and looks toward the innovative use of APPPs to leverage additional funds for development.  Building alliances with private sector actors will also allow the USAID Mission to capitalize upon additional opportunities to leverage non-US government funds, address cross cutting themes, and promote long-term sustainability.  The total estimated value is between $19-28 million and anticipated buy-ins with a total estimated value of $ 22 million.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to clarify the due date for Expressions of Interest (EOI's).  EOI's are due on Wednesday, September 10, 2008.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The United States Government is seeking sources for Office and Related Space
in the Central Employment Area, Washington, DC.

REQUIREMENT:     The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in Washington, DC, under a lease that expires on November 30, 2008.  The Government is seeking to lease 104,934 BOMA Rentable Square Feet (BRSF) of office and related space, including 6 parking spaces.  The 104,934 BRSF of space must yield at least 96,557 BOMA Area Square Feet (BOASF).  The space must be provided in one building.  The delineated area for this requirement is the Central Employment Area in Washington, DC.  

The requirement is for a 10-year term fully serviced lease with termination options after the 7th year.  The space must be ready for occupancy by December 1, 2008.  

The Government intends to enter into a sole source procurement to remain in its existing leased space but will accept expressions of interest to determine whether there are other potentially acceptable locations that demonstrate the best interests of the Government are served by moving to an alternate location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, relocation costs, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements.  The Government is presently seeking authority to enter into a sole source succeeding lease at the existing location and therefore reserves the right to cancel any ongoing procurement that might result from the identification of other potentially acceptable locations.

The Governments decision regarding whether or not to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this notification.  In the event that a potentially acceptable offer fails to provide required information as part of its response to this notification, the Government reserves the right to assume that the building in question cannot meet the Governments requirements.

Expressions of interest must be in writing and should be forwarded by 3:00 pm on Wednesday, September 10, 2008 to:

Question and Answers

Question  The demountable partition system will be unstable when the ceiling system is removed, this is necessitated by the construction outlined in items 2, 4, 7 and 9.  Therefore, is GSA planning to remove and reinstall the partitions or will they be protected and laterally braced during the construction phase?

Answer  GSA will not be doing anything to support, nor will we be removing and replacing wall systems.  That must be considered a design element and the construction contractor will be required to take this issue into consideration.

Question  If the new lighting and mechanical system change the plenum height then will the scope of work include the selection and specification of a new demountable partition system?

Answer  GSA is not changing any wall systems under this project.

Question  Are there any hazardous materials in the building?

Answer  Based upon the PDS report the following is noted:  The work on this site will require the various materials be properly handled.  These include fluids associated with removing the existing generator (i.e. diesel fuel, antifreeze, battery acid and oil), fluorescent lamps (mercury) and old magnetic ballasts (possible PCBs).  The only known asbestos in the building is in the floor tiles in the Ground Floor and in the Second Floor elevator lobby.  This project should not disturb those tiles and no asbestos abatement is contemplated.

Question  Will the roof top work, items 1 and 3 necessitate removal and replacement of the roof membrane?  If so, will this work be done under this project or a separate project?  Of the roof is replaced will a green roof would be required to improve the roof performance and reduce energy consumption?

Answer  No, the roof is currently being solicited for replacement with a September 06 finish date under a separate contract.  It is anticipated that there will be a newly installed roof at the time this project begins.

Question  Will the building exterior glass be replaced under a separate contract to improve it performance and reduce energy consumption?

Answer  No

Question  The central toilet rooms are accessible.  Will all toilet rooms be modified as part of this work?

Answer  If the rest-rooms are required to have sprinkler devices, then all rest-rooms will be included in the project.  Ventilation will be a part of the design as well.

Question  Will the day care system upgrades the performed in two phases to allow the daycare to remain on the first floor, in operation during construction?

Answer  Phasing issues to be determined during design.

Question  What is the projected construction cost of the scope of construction items 1 through 9?

Answer  Refer to the synopsis/amendment

Question  Will the elevators and stairs be renovated as part of prime objective number 3?

Answer  Work in the stairs with reference to the existing standpipes/installation of the sprinkler system is part of the project.

Question  What is the square footage of the building?

Answer  636,434 GSF

Question  Is the parking structure included in the gross square feet provided in the project announcement?

Answer  No

Question  Who did the Program Development Study for this project?  When was it completed?

Answer  Architura, February 2004

Question  For our firm and designer portfolios, can we include projects where the design is complete, but not yet fully constructed?

Answer  GSA cannot direct firms on what or how to address the Request for Qualifications (RFQ)

Question  For the section entitled Philosophy and Design Intent, is the two page maximum for both Lead Engineer and Lead Designer combined, or can the Lead Engineer and Lead Designer each write a two pages a piece?

Answer  GSA cannot direct firms on what or how to address the Request for Qualifications (RFQ)

Question  What happens if something fails with FedEx/UPS and the shipment does not arrive on time?

Answer  Submittal must be stamped in (JCK building) on or before 4:00 p.m., Central Standard Time

Question:	The RFP specifies that design meetings are to be held in Washington D.C. every 2 weeks for 18 months.  Will this be the case?

Response:	The schedule & location of meetings will be addressed in the amended RFP.  Three Official Design Meetings at the 30%, 70%, 100% stage will be held in at the site in Indianapolis, IN. Six pre-construction meetings will be held at the A/Es office in Washington D.C..  A CD of drawings will be submitted to the CMc, and then utilize video-conferencing to hold discussions.    CDs will be available through postal service (i.e. overnight) to adhere to GSAs security requirements regarding the transmission of such documents electronically.

Question:	Where will other meetings be held?

Response:  Verification of tenant requirements will be at the site.  Other  meetings with GSA & A/E may be held in Washington D.C.  Major Submission Meetings, typically include participation from the following:
	-CMc reps
	-PM
	-VE Staff
	-Estimating Staff
	-Field Operations
	-Principal and PM

Question:	What is the level of documentation expected from the A-E at each submittal stage?

Response:  The A-E will build from the scope, and will submit the following at each submission stage, including:
	a.   Investigate Site
b.   Verify Scope
a.	Report Out
b.	Cost Estimate
c.	Phasing Plan
d.	Schedule Plan

From these schedules, the CMc will give their input.  The CMc will verify estimating services the A-E provides.

Question:	Who controls A-E Submissions & Level of Submissions?  Who keeps the Design & Scope on schedule?

Response:	CMc is responsible to keep the schedule on-track.  The ultimate responsibility if the scope/schedule should slip will be that of GSA.  However, the CMc will be responsible to provide recommendations/concerns regarding the scope & schedule and report them in a timely manner to GSA.  GSA will enforce the A-E to act and proceed according to schedule.

Question:	Will the CMc do their own cost estimate or will they verify that of the A-Es?

Response:	The CMc will analyze and verify the A/Es cost estimate. The cost estimate must not exceed the projects budget.

Question:	Will the CMc work with the A-E regarding the schedule and phasing of the project?

Response:	Yes, it will be a collaborative effort of all parties.

Question:	How will scope be controlled?  What about Tenant Improvement work?

Response:	Scope will be developed during the Concept Stage.  The CMc will be participating in this stage to help define the scope so that changes will be minimized as the project progresses.  There is no tenant improvement work currently included in the scope; however, such work may arise as the project progresses.

Question:	What is the contingency for the project?

Response:	 GSA will have a small contingency during the Design & Construction Phases; however, the CMc SHOULD NOT RELY ON THESE FUNDS BECAUSE THE A/E AND THE CMc WILL BE SELECTED ON DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE CRITERIA.

Question:	The CMc will have a higher confidence level should the A-E provide the level of detail needed.  However, what happens if unforeseen site conditions arise?

Response:	GSA WILL NOT request funds for escalation. The Budget must be met.

Question:	Is the ECCA closer to $30 million or $40 million.

Response:  Addressed in the RFP. The Estimate Construction Cost at Award is $36,000.000.

Question:	Will the four (4) Partnering Meetings be held in Washington D.C. or Indianapolis?

Response:	Partnering Sessions will be held in Indianapolis so that tenants can attend.

Question:	Commissioning Services- where do they start/end in regards to the CMcs own commissioning services?

Response:	Panos Giannakopouls reads an excerpt from the draft RFP for 3rd Party Commissioning. 
	The Commissioning Plan shall be provided by the Commissioning Agency
	The Commissioning Agency shall conduct a focused review of te design prior to the construction document phase to ensure that each commissioned feature of system meets the owners requirements relative to functionality, energy performance, maintainability, system cost, indoor environmental quality, and local environmental impacts.
	The Commissioning Authority must sufficiently observe installation of each type of commissioned feature to ensure that they are properly installed according to the contract documents and manufacturers instructions, and that other building components are not compromising the performance of the feature.
	After the contractor completes the start-up and initial checkout of all items listed in the contract documents, the C. Agency applies appropriate techniques to verify that start-up and initial checkout of all commissioned equipment is successfully completed.
	The C. Agency is to review and approve the contractors Testing & Balancing Contractor functional testing plan prior to the start of testing.
	The C. Agency is to receive, review, and compile all General Contractor submittals.

Question:	The RFP indicates that the 3rd Party Commissioning Agent will perform mechanical/HVAC services only.  Is this true?

Response:	The 3rd Party Commissioning Agent will provide a commissioning plan, address lighting, environmental responsiveness and energy efficiency, HVAC, fire alarm system, sprinkler system, and LEED Commissioning.  GSA will clarify CMcs scope regarding commissioning services.

Question:	Is there a duplication of commissioning services?  Commissioning should start during Design to gain a LEED point.  Refer to page 1-24, 4.35-provide coordination.

Response:	 3rd Party Commissioning Agent will provide the Commissioning Plan & Testing.  The CMc will do the work; the 3rd Party will observe, test, and verify.  GSA will clarify in amended RFP.

Question:	Is there swing space available?

Response:	There has been some space identified by building management and the previous A-E in the basement.  Some storage will also be converted into swing space.  This needs to be done to accommodate tenants.  GSA is aware that some tenants prefer not to move into this space.

Question:	Will the CMc work with the Building Manager to communicate and address tenant concerns?

Response:	During the Construction phase, the A-E as well as the CMc must have a Tenant Coordinator/Liaison.

Question:	Who will actually move fixtures, furniture, etc?

Response:	The CMc

Question:	Are there funds set-aside for security issues?  U.S. Marshalls Services (USMS)?

Response:	Some funds are included in the project for guards.  USMS will fund aspects of the project according to their own agency requirements.

Question:	Will the GSA Building Manager be the communication point of contact between the CMc and the tenants?

Response:	Yes.

Question:	How many courtrooms are being renovated?

Response:	None.  No renovation of rooms- just Fire Alarm & Sprinkler systems.

Question:	What if the judge refuses to have fire protection and window replacement in their chambers?  Is there a requirement to make tenants comply?

Response:	We will comply with code.  GSA has a very stringent Fire & Life Safety (FLS) branch that is very involved in the project.  They will ensure that the project will be executed according to code.  They will take a firm responsibility that the code will be enforced.  All tenants will have to participate and comply.  The work will be done after-hours.  Planning is the key to success.

Question:	Are Security Clearances done through Homeland Security?

Response:	Yes.  It is the Contractors responsibility (A-E, CMc, CM, sub-contractors) to submit documents and obtain clearance.  Contractors need to be mindful that clearance takes time.

Question:	The RFP states that the selected CMc for pre-construction services will have the option to go to the construction phase.  Is this true?

Response:	Yes.  This is an option that GSA may choose to exercise.

Question:	Clarification needed for page 1-9 regarding: FY2005 Funds vs. Optional work.

Response:	GSA will provide the A-Es schedule of submission.  It will be provided through an amended RFP or through meeting minutes.

Question:	Is the bonding requirement submitted at bid or at the construction phase?

Response:	At the Construction phase.



Question:	Construction estimates should be broken-out how?

Response:	3 Estimates needed:
	FY05 Design  base work
	FY06 Design  optional work
	FY06 Construction  optional 

Question:	Provide clarification regarding the conversion of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) to a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP).  Ref. page 1-4, 2.8.

Response:	Pre-construction should include the base work & option pricing.  The GMP will be established for Construction.  The pricing is due with the bid proposals.

Question:	The CMc will have no control over the Design of the project.  How can a GMP be established if there is no control over the A-Es design.

Response:	The CMc selected will work with the A-E in the pre-construction phase to adhere to a GMP.


Meeting Concludes with a tour of the building.

All fututur questions must be addressed in writing to Bobbie Tyler.

The Government requests that the CMc contractor submit as an option to their contract, to provide full Independent Commissioning Services, for the pre-construction as well as the construction phases of the project.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide Government responses to all questions submitted by interested parties to date.

1. How will the rope be deployed?  I could not find any discussion about rope deployment.
The rope will be deployed to the rear of the vehicle with the winch in free-spool operation as described in SAE J706 paragraph 3.1. 2. Is the 42,500 lb. pull based on a bare drum or on the top layer of rope?
The 42,500 lb. pull is based on a bare drum.
3.  Were the specification based on a prototype APU/Winch Configuration previously fabricated and tested by the JPO MRAP?  If so, who provided the prototype?
Yes, it was based on the users' requirement specified in the MRAP Capabilities Production Document (CPD) and also market research conducted by the MRAP JPO staff.  This market research included a test of several COTS APU systems.  At this time, information WRT the market research results is not releasable outside of the Government.
4.  Para 3.2.2.10 Enclosure states "The APU Subsystem shall be ballistically tolerant to withstand 7.62mm direct fire threats."      a.  Question:  Please define ballistically tolerant.      b.  What type of 7.62mm ammunition must we protect against and at what angle and at what distance?     c.    Is protection required for all sides or for specific areas for the APU and Winch?
The APU Subsystem shall be capable of withstandingpenetration/perforation on all exposed faces* against small arms threats.More specific information regarding ballistic requirement are classified SECRET in accordance with the MRAP Security Classification Guide.  Please verify that your company is cleared to receive classified information up tothe Secret level, the Government will then provide you pertinent information via proper channels.
*Any face at any obliquity that could be targeted at a 0 degree elevation.

<DESC>NOTICE:  The issuance of the RFP has been briefly delayed.  Although an exact release date is to be determined, it should be NLT 4 May 09.
The purpose of this modification is to provide Government responses to all questions submitted by interested parties to date.
1. Request clarification on the document titled Interface Drawing.  The drawings provided in the draft RFP are space claim drawings.  They provide only the location and space available for the APU and Winch.  An Interface Control Drawing would include the electrical and mechanical interface requirements, such as existing appurtenances, bosses, tapped holes, brackets, etc., which can be used for the installation of the APU and Winch system; or are these requirements that need to be developed under the contract.
Answer:  Attached please find the revised drawing, 93051, Rev. A.  In reviewing the bidder's question, they asked for "existing appurtenances, bosses, tapped holes, brackets, etc., which can be used for the installation of the APU and Winch system".  This leads me to believe that it was not clear that the vendor supplied winch mounting brackets are to be welded to the hull of the Buffalo vehicle.  The previous version of the drawing showed the weld area space for the APU mounting brackets on sheet 1 zone B-4 but did not specifically call out the weld area space for the winch mounting brackets.  This has now been clarified with an additional view on sheet 5 zone A-5 showing the weld area for the winch.


Attached drawings supercede all previous versions.
