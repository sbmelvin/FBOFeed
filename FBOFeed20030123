<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Lithium Ion Battery Testing.  The contractor shall furnish personnel, service, parts, materials, equipment and facilities necessary to design, analyze, manufacture, inspect, test and deliver twelve (12) space qualified sealed Li-I battery cells with a nameplate capacity of 100 ampere-hours (Ah) (C) when discharged at 50 A (C/2) A and at 20 degrees C to 3 V.  Upon receipt, the cells will be characterized and eight matched cells (+_ 3% in capacity and impedance) will be used to contruct a battery pack.  A Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) cycle testing under unique GPM charge profile at 20 degrees C will be performed on the battery pack.	The test data will be used to assess the technology for and to infuse Li-I battery technology in this mission.  Performance:  Operational Goals - The cells manufactured and qualitied to this requirement shall be capable of operation in LEO where the total number of charge/discharge cycles will be 20,000 with a depth of discharge (DoD) of 30 percent of end of life capacity.  Discharge rate will vary from 5 to 300 A. Capacity - The cell shall have a useable capacity of greater than 100 Ah at a standard discharge rate following a standard charge at the end of useful life.  High Rate Capacity - The cell shall be capable of a "3C" A discharge for 1 minute, with a minimum allowable cell voltage of 3.0 V, immediately after it has had 50 Ah removed at the C/2 rate.	 Complete specifications will be supplied with the Request for Quotation.  Period of Performance will be 3 months from the date of award. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Japanese Storage Battery Company, Tokyo, Japan.	The Lithium Ion is a new technology, which has a potential for aerospace application.

<DESC>The requirement is for the purchase of a Triple Point of Water Maintenance System.  The Air Force requirements for this item will consist of an apparatus and Triple Point of Water Cell that will allow the PMELS to create and maintain the Triple Point of Water (TPW) for temperature calibrations for a period of time very efficiently and accurately.  This method would require only minimal operator time and no external mediums or solutions to initiate the freeze.  The TPW is one of the primary temperature reference points on the new Temperature Scale, ITS-90.  This item will be used to verify the lab?s Primary Temperature Reference Standard, the SPRT (Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometer) before and after each use.  The TPW measurement is important since it is the reference point from which all further temperature calibrations are compared with.  Used in this way, the TPW can verify if the SPRT has drifted due to time, handling, or shipment.  Also, the TPW Maintenance System can be used in other temperature calibrations that previously required the calibration technician to make an ice bath using distilled ice/water and an insulated Dewar.  The complete requirements are described in the AFMETCAL purchase description.  The purchase description will be a part of the solicitation package.  This will be a commercial solicitation utilizing simplified acquisition procedures under FAR Part 12 and 13.  A product sample unit and technical proposal will be required with the solicitation response.  The basic quantity is for 20 each with extended five year warranty and data in accordance with DD Form 1423s.  There is a FY 04 option for an additional quantity range of 1-20 units with warranty and data, and a FY 05 option for an additional quantity range of 1-50 units with warranty and data.  Delivery shall be FOB destination to AFMETCAL Det 1, Heath OH 43056-6116.  The solicitation is anticipated to be issued on 30 Jan 03 with a closing date of 19 Feb 03.  The solicitation will be posted at this location or request a copy from Carol Zigan, AFMETCAL Det 1, 813 Irving-Wick Dr W, Heath OH 43056-6116.  Fax requests are acceptable at 740-788-5157.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology is conducting research in cooperation with several private and public entities intended to establish the technical basis for codes and standards related to protected elevators that can be safely used during fires and other emergencies for fire service access, occupant egress, and evacuation of people with disabilities.  This work builds on research conducted by NIST in cooperation with many of the same entities in the 1980's and early 1990's that addressed some of the important issues and which led to limited acceptance of protected elevators in some codes.  The work also requires the application of specific expertise in the area of smoke management to issues that have been raised in the building codes regarding the spread of smoke in fires through elevator hoistways and the possible need for lobbies to limit the spread of smoke by this means.

The objectives of this Statement of Work are to apply world-class expertise to the collection, review, analysis, and interpretation of existing data and practices, and to the development of recommendations for changes to codes, standards, and practices that would result in safe and reliable elevator systems for the uses identified.

Details of this requirement will be provided in the solicitation.  The Government anticipates the award of a commercial Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order for a period of thirteen (13) months to begin on or about March 3, 2003 through April 2, 2004.  It is anticipated that a single solicitation will be issued on or about February 5, 2003 at www.fedbizopps.gov.  The solicitation, all amendments and any questions and answers to the solicitation will be posted to FEDBIZOPPS and are totally the responsibility of the Offeror.  No mailing lists will be kept and no hard copy of the RFQ will be available.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required.

Q2:  Where is the detailed drawings of the LO2 accumulator, SMN24-100268? A2:  Drawing number SMN24-100268 was inadvertently mis-numbered.  The correct drawing number is SMN24-100269. This drawing was provided in the initial solicitation.  Q3:  There are 4 High Point Bleed/RV Ports in Figure 2 but only two apparent in drawing number SLN24-100270. Where are the other two ports? A3: The location of the other two ports is to be detemined by the offeror. The final drawings will be updated at contract start. Q4:  The SOW requires two identical units.  Does this mean jacketed systems for both the LOX and Ethanol?   A4:	Yes. Both sides are vacuum jacketed in the current approach and design. This was determined to have some advantages 1) in cost by avoiding two different design and manufacturing steps,	2) in the thermal conditioning of the ethanol, and 3) in simulating a flight feedline. The ethanol lines in space will be in a vacuum and have MLI. Heaters are being avoided for ethanol systems. Q5:  The SOW states that the LOX system be designed for Helium service. Please clarify what this means.  A5:  Commercial vacuum jacketed lines and components typically have more insulation (30 layers MLI versus 15) and lower heat leak when designed for Liquid Helium service. This requirement was intended for those proposing commercial components. Q6:  What specific style of bayonet is required?  Male?  Female?	Air Force?  Vendor Specific?   A6:  The details of the bayonet can be negotiated within the requirements for heat leak and pipe sizes and then finalized at the CDR.  Q7:  Are performance requirements for acceptance testing available?  A7:  The SOW lists the required acceptance tests. The specified values (proof pressure, cleanliness, heat leak, etc) for these tests are in the specification. The vendor shall be responsible for defining how these are to be verified for acceptance. Q8:  When is anticipated ATP?  A8:  The anticipated ATP is March 2003. Q9:  What aspects of a flight tank are to be simulated?  A9:  There are currently minimal primary objectives to simulate a flight tank, other than 1) the tank is sized to provide approximate capacity of RCS type systems, and 2) the tank is insulated to provide a relatively stable liquid oxygen and ethanol supply temperature over the intended test period of 7 days.  Q10:  What are the termination requirements for the instrumentation interface and control wiring? (i.e. connectors, J-box terminations).	  A10:	The specific connectors, terminations, etc are to be detailed and agreed to by the CDR. Q11:  What is the class of leakage required for the valves? A11:  Internal leakage of all valve components shall be bubble tight using Gaseous helium. Q12:  Are valve position indicators visual or electronic?  A12: The indicators are electronic.  Q13:  Any supply pressure limitations for pneumatic actuators?  A13: There are no limitations. Q14:  Who provides pressure transducers and relief valves throughout each system?	A14:  Test facility will provide the pressure transducers and relief valves.  Q15:  Are specific piping elbows required to be mitered as shown in envelope drawing?   A15:  The piping elbows are not required to be mitered as shown.  The internal piping is a radius bend.	Q16:  On drawings SLN24-100270 and SDN24-100274, multiple two and three place decimal dimensions are called out.  Is this tolerance required?   A16:  The two and three decimal tolerances are inadvertent.  Requirement 3.2.3 states that the lengths of individual line segments between valves shall be within +/- 1 inch. There is substantial flexibility in the dimensional tolerance. The dimensional tolerances are to be established by the vendor for the end item as required for manufacturability. The tolerances for the accumulator SMN24-100269 are TBD, but it will meet those required by vendor to install the component. These tolerances will be agreed to prior to CDR. Q17: Do you have preferred material compatibility reference documents? Drawings SLN24-100266 and SMN24-100268 are referenced in the end item spec, and are not included in the package.	A17: LO2 fluid systems and components shall be designed and operated according to NSS 1740.15 (Jan 1996) or an equivalent ASME standard. Drawing SLN24-100266 is provided in the amendment #1. The drawing SMN24-100268 should be deleted from SOW and specification, as it has no necessary information. Q18.  In the SOW, Section "3.0 End Item Specification,"  paragraph 3.1.15 states, "The propellant tank pressure vessel shall be SPHERICAL." In the diagram, "End Item:	Tank, Feedsystem, Valves, and Structures," page "17" of the SOW, the Tank is CYLINDRICAL.   A18: The drawings show the outer vacuum jacket and the pressure (inner) vessel is spherical.	Q19.  If all other specifications are met (e.g., heat leak, capacity, pressure rating, etc.), will a cylindrical propellant tank pressure vessel be acceptable?	A19: The inner pressure vessel was specified as spherical to reduce heat leak by reducing surface area and to also reduce chill-down mass.	 Q20.  What are the concerns about a cylindrical tank that would need to be addressed for it to be considered equal in performance to a spherical tank?  A20:  The cylindrical tank would need to have the same or less chill-down mass then a spherical, and the same or better heat transfer.	  Q21.	If a cylindrical tank is acceptable but a spherical is preferred, can we submit two proposals with two different prices, one for a cylindrical and one for spherical? A21:   Yes. Two proposals, with a justification, can be submitted. Q22.  Are "GLOBE" valves a requirement?	A22.  Globe valves are not a requirement. Q23.  What are the concerns about non-globe valves that would need to be addressed for it to be considered equal in performance to GLOBES? A23.  There are no concerns with other valves as long as they meet the requirements such as heat leak and pressure drop. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.

<DESC>NA **THIRD NOTICE - This synopis is being issued to extend the response date from: 24 January 2003 to:  31 January 2003.** The United States Army is placing greater emphasis on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (RSTA) capabilities through the increased use of manned and unmanned sensors and sensor syste ms and payloads.  PM RUS is responsible for unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) and unattended ground sensors (UGS) and payloads for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).  PM RUS is collecting information on the numerous sensor and sensor system and payload types and  their capabilities available in the commercial sector (producible) and under development.  Understand that there are significant weight and volume limitations for UAV based sensors, therefore anything larger than 150 pounds or 68.4 kilograms or 3 cubic fe et or .057 cubic meters will be to large for our needs.  Also, UGS are normally man portable at or below 45 pounds or 20.52 kilograms.  Product Manager, Robotic and Unmanned Sensors (PM RUS) will use this information initially to develop a sensors and payl oads catalog based on their type and level of maturity.  As the Army's Operational Requirements Documents (ORD) mature, this catalog of information will be utilized to assess the sensor, sensor system, and payload types that are available to meet the Army' s requirements as well as identify efforts under development that may satisfy Government requirements in the future.  The Government is requesting two pages of information.  The first page of information provided by a potential offeror will be listed on th e PM RUS public access web site and in a published Sensors and Payloads Catalog.  The second page of potential offeror provided information will be for the US Government's internal usage only.  The catalog will be reviewed and updated periodically to ensur e it remains current.  This will be achieved by periodic requests for information, which will be posted via the Federal Business Opportunities Page.  If and when it is practical, PM RUS will purse the establishment of ordering and/or omnibus type contracts  with offerors to meet the Army's needs.  PM RUS will also share the general sensor, sensor system and payload information collected and any developed contracting capacities with other Army, Service and Agency offices that have similar requirements.  Senso r, sensor system, payload and program information is requested on the following sensor, sensor system and payload types and capabilities - Acoustic; Agile Electro-Optic / Infrared (EO/IR); Airborne Minefield Detection (AMD); Biological Weapons Detection (B WD); Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN); Chemical Weapons Detection (CWD); Communications / Data Relay (CDR); Communications & Noncommunications Electronic Attack (CNEA); Communications Electronic Attack (CEA); Electro-Optic (EO); Electr o-Optic / Infrared (EO/IR); Electro-Optic / Infrared (EO/IR) with Laser Designator (EO/IR/LD); Electro-Optic / Infrared (EO/IR) with Laser Airborne Mine Detection (LAMD); Electronic Intelligence (EI); Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR); Foliage Penetration (F OPEN); Ground Surveillance Radar (GSR); Hyper-Spectral (HS); Imager - Daylight; Imager Infrared (Imager IR); ISR Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT); Laser Radar (LADAR); Laser Range Finder (LRF); Laser Range Finder / Target Designator (LRF/TD) ; Laser Range, Laser Indicator, Laser Designator (LD/LI/LD); Laser Spot Tracker (LST); Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR); Magnetic; Meteorological; Multi-Spectral (MS); Nuclear Radiation Detection (NRD); Passive Infrared (Passive IR); Radio Frequency (RF ); Seismic; Sense Through Foliage (STF); Sense Through The Wall (STTW); Signal Intelligence (SIGINT); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with Moving Target Indicator (MTI); Thermal Weapon Sight (TWS); Ultra-Spectral (US); Uncool ed Infrared (Uncooled IR); and Urba n/MOUT Advanced Sensor System (UMASS).  For additional information and appropriate formats for the desired information refer to https://peoiews.monmouth.army.mil/RUS/offeror.htm, first, or contact Major Michael Wegler, email: michael.wegler@iews.monmouth.army.mil, (732) 427-5819, FAX (732) 427-5072.

<DESC>This is a modification to the request for information (sources sought) for a long haul video system.  This modification is issued to answer questions posed by interested parties.  The date for submission of capability statements and descriptive literature is extended until February 7, 2003.  Again, please note that there is no solicitation document available, nor is the Government soliciting bids or offers at this point.  There will be no more questions accepted after this publication of questions and answers.
 

1.	Does the system need to be covert?
    
            No, but the more covert, the better.
  
2.	Will the site be protected or subject to capture?

The area may be subject to capture.
 
3.	Do you require Type I  encryption or is SSL/DES/AES acceptable?

Type I encryption ? not required, SSL/DES/AES is acceptable (Video must be free of intercept and comprimise)

4.	Do you want full control of the cameras-zoom, slow motion, stop frame,  digital picture capture?

We plan to use NTSC type input cameras with the video transmission  system, however, any system that uses its own camera systems may be submitted.  If submitting camera systems with the transmission system, then control of the cameras would be beneficial.

5.	What are the projected quantities?

Not decided, depends on capabilities of  selected system.

6.	Will there be a single or  multiple hub/spoke arrangement?

Neither is required-Transmission to a single receiving location,-ATF will evaluate proposals that use the receiving location as the hub and then redistributes the signal to multiple locations as long as the transmitter to receiving location meets the transmission distance specifications.
  
7.	Will there be multiple-simultaneous-hook ups?

Not required.

8.	Do you want the system integrated in cases, vehicles, trailers?

Yes, portable in cases.  Will look at systems integrated into vehicles (ATF vehicles only).

9.	When do you expect an RFP and do you have the funds budgeted ?

Funds have been budgeted, no decision on when or if an RFP will be issued.

10.	Please confirm whether the system is intended to be one way or two way for voice, video,  data or subsets thereof?

System is intended for one way transmission (transmitter to a receiver).

11.	Please confirm that the video signals are being sent from the field location to a central site.

It can be sent to a central location, but the intention is to transmit from field to receiving location (both can be at various locations).

12.	Please clarify how the video will be viewed:  to a monitor or to browser.

Monitor-NTSC output..

<DESC>This Synopsis Is Being Issued To Update Potential Offerors On The Status For The Upcoming Procurement Of An Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System (Aims) To Be Installed In The Ch-46 Helicopter.  PROPOSALS ARE NOT REQUESTED AT THIS TIME AND WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED UNTIL AFTER THE SOLICITATION IS RELEASED.  The draft solicitation is expected to be released on or around January 24, 2003 and may be accessed at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/.  IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE ACCESSING THIS WEB-SITE, please contact one of the Points of Contact listed below (via e-mail) and the documents can be sent to you electronically (upon release of the DRAFT RFP). The closing date for comments to the DRAFT RFP will be 5 February 2003.  The release date for the final solicitation will be published in a subsequent synopsis. 

The U.S. Marine Corps has a requirement for an Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System (AIMS) and related supplies and services for the CH-46E aircraft. The primary components of AIMS will be desktop software application, onboard Processor Unit, a Display Unit, Optical Rotor Tracker, Vibration Sensors, cable assemblies and miscellaneous aircraft installation components. AIMS will be the consolidation and integration of existing support equipment functions including rotor track and balance (Chadwick-Helmuth P0372/8500C), vibration monitoring and analysis (Chadwick-Helmuth 14235), engine data acquisition and analysis (Howell H337NP600A).
AIMS, when installed in the CH-46E aircraft, will provide for integrated rotor track and balance capability, continuous monitoring of vibration levels of all dynamic components and engine performance parameters. AIMS will also provide for future implementation of aircrew in-flight warnings for basic vibration exceedances and engine parameter exceedances. AIMS data will be downloaded to a desktop software application for additional data analysis, trending and storage. AIMS will be user configurable to the extent required for vibration alarming and initializing aircraft configurations. The benefits of an onboard monitoring system include the preservation of aircraft structure and electronic components life, tremendous reductions in maintenance man-hours due to enhanced trouble shooting /fault isolation and the elimination of ground support equipment requirements. The requirement includes the aircraft kits, ancillary hardware, and engineering services necessary to upgrade CH-46E aircraft.

The proposed contract will include basic line items for the non-recurring engineering required to manufacture two (2) each AIMS prototype kits, including all software and peculiar support equipment; two (2) each AIMS Engineering Simulation Systems including all software; and two (2) each AIMS Validation/Verification kits including all software and peculiar support equipment.  Repair, training, and technical support services and associated hardware/software shall also be provided as part of the basic requirement.   Upon satisfactory completion of first article testing, options may be exercised for up to 215 each AIMS production kits; spare and repair parts; 72 each ancillary equipment and associated software; User/Engineering Ground Software; 2 each Maintenance Trainer units; and repair, training, and technical support services for the preceding items.   Hardware deliveries are required as follows:  Prototype kits ? 8 months after contract award (ACA); Engineering Simulation Systems ? First unit: 8 months ACA/Second unit:  16 months ACA; VAL/VER kits ? 14 months ACA; Production kits and Interim Spares ? 6 months after production (option 1) contract award.  Upon final release of the RFP, proposals will be evaluated based upon each offeror?s Technical Approach, Past Performance and Price.  Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.

The solicitations will be in a downloadable, printable format when viewed with an Adobe Acrobat Reader. Free software is available at http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html.  Gateway technical assistance is available at admin_support@pgmail.daps.mil.  The Defense appropriations and authorization acts and other statutes (including what is commonly referred to as "The Berry Amendment") impose restrictions on the DoD's acquisition of foreign products and services.  Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and "specialty metals" (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7014) must be grown, reprocessed, reused, melted or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.

<SOLNBR>1435-01-03-RP-71562
<RESPDATE>021803
<ARCHDATE>01232004
<CONTACT>Michael W. Hargrove Contract Specialist 7037871367     Michael.Ha= rgrove@mms.gov;
<DESC>The northwestern Gulf is an active, oceanographic region in terms of = Loop Current Rings (LCR), eddies, and exchange between the southern and nor= thern Gulf of Mexico.  As the western boundary of the Gulf, the northwester= n region is the final destination of LCR.  While Nowlin et al. (2001) highl= ighted the scarcity of current measurements in the northwestern Gulf of Mex= ico, they showed adequate hydrographic data coverage in the area.  This une= ven coverage of data is undesirable because leasing in the region already e= xtends to the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and is forecast to increase eve= n more.  Subsequent exploration activity in deepwater of the northwestern G= ulf is also expected to increase in the near future.  The increasing trend = in exploration is highlighted by the rise in exploration plan submissions a= nd permit requests.  To address this knowledge gap, the MMS plans to conduc= t this study.  THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY ARE: (1) to increase our deepwa= ter current database and knowledge of the deep circulation in the northwest= ern Gulf of Mexico; (2) to gather sufficient information to estimate oceano= graphic parameters needed to make experimental designs of full scale physic= al oceanography studies in deepwater; and (3) to provide information for us= e in oil spill analyses, including the emerging deep spill analysis, other = ongoing studies, to help evaluate exploration plans; and contribute to the = preparation of NEPA documents.  The performance period of this study shall = be forty (40) months, but the fieldwork of this study shall last eighteen (= 18) months at the beginning of the resultant Contract, including six (6) mo= nths for mobilization and twelve (12) months of actual data collection.  Th= e remaining time, twenty-two (22) months, shall be devoted to analyses, syn= thesis of results, and completion of all deliverables. The study area is th= e region over the continental slope and rise of the northwestern Gulf of Me= xico.  THE STUDY AREA CONSISTS OF AMERICAN AND MEXICAN SECTORS, AND THE RES= ULTANT CONTRACT WILL ONLY ADDRESS THE AMERICAN SECTOR.  The American area i= s the sector bounded by 93=B0W longitude on the East, 26=B0N latitude on th= e South, and the 200-m isobath on the onshore boundary.  THE ESTIMATED COST=  OF THE AMERICAN SECTOR OF THIS STUDY IS BETWEEN $3,000,000 AND $3,500,000.=   This study consists of four (4) main tasks: (1) Establishing a Science Re= view Group; (2) Conducting a post award meeting; (3) Field work and data co= llection (moorings deployments) over eighteen (18) months; and (4) Complete=  all data analyses and report preparation.  HOW TO RESPOND:  In order to co= mpete for this contract, interested parties must demonstrate that they are = qualified to perform the work by providing a Capability Statement, not late= r than 5 p.m. on 18 FEB 2003, detailing: (1) Your Key Personnel, scientific=  and technical, (those who would have the primary responsibility for perfor= ming and/or managing the project) with their qualifications, specific exper= tise, and experience, and your organization's experience with this type of = work. Particularly relevant is their expertise in the fields of physical oc= eanography (Eulerian data analysis and field work experience) and remote se= nsing as demonstrated by qualification and authorship in peer-reviewed publ= ications.  Information about technical personnel who will be responsible fo= r the organization of information and the production of documents and manus= cripts must be provided.  (2) A description of your facilities.  (3) Past P= erformance:  Specific references (including project identifier/contract num= ber and description, period of performance, dollar amount, client name, and=  current telephone number) for work of this nature that your personnel or o= rganization is currently performing or has completed within the last three = (3) years.  Specifically, the MMS is looking for a demonstrated ability to:=  timely complete projects; adhere to schedules and budgets; employ effectiv= e cost controls; the quality of products delivered; and the degree of compa= rability of past projects to the current project, including number, complex= ity, and size.  Information about your subcontracts, partners, and quality = of cooperation between organization, staff, key personnel, and the client m= ust be provided.  Also, please include any negative references and your reb= uttal explaining your side of the story.  ALL REFERENCES WILL BE CHECKED TO=  VALIDATE THE INFORMATION PROVIDED.  Offerors shall submit an Original and = four (4) copies of the Capabilities Statement to Michael W. Hargrove, Contr= acting Officer, Minerals Management Service, Procurement Operations Branch,=  MS 2510, 381 Elden St., Herndon VA 20170-4817.  Eight (8) additional copie= s shall be submitted to Ms. Connie Landry, Minerals Management Service, Gul= f of Mexico OCS Region, 1201 Elmwood Park Boulevard, MS 5431, New Orleans L= A 70123-2394.

<ARCHDATE>04142003
<CONTACT>Shante McGee, 732-532-1103
<DESC>NA BATTERIES  USACECOM anticipates soliciting proposals during the 2QFY03 for an initiative to develop a state of charge indicator for various lithium batteries being introduced into the DoD inventory.  State of charge is defined as the amount of capacity re maining in a battery.  The design/prototype portion of the program is valued at $100K.  Cost sharing of the program will be mandatory.  Depending on the success of this effort, awarding of a production contract(s) may result.  Up to two awards for a six mo nth period are projected for the design/prototype effort.   The goal of this effort is to demonstrate a cost effective state of charge technology for lithium sulfur dioxide and lithium manganese dioxide batteries.  It is not required that any proposed technology be applicable to both the lithium sulfur dioxide and lithium manganese dioxide battery technologies.  Potential offerors can propose against either or both technologies.  Any solutions for the lithium sulfur dioxide battery technology shall be designed for use with the BA-5112 battery, and shall display the remaining capacity in no greater than 10% increments.  Solutions proposed for the lithium manganese dioxide battery technology shall be designed for use with the BA-5390 battery and shall display the remaining capacity in no greater than 20% increments. Th e accuracy of the display should be no greater than +/- 3%. The proposed technologies may be internal to the battery, an external device, or a combination of both.  The deliverables at the end of the program shall be 25 working samples of the device.  Also the government will require any applicable data rights (dra wings, software protocols, licensing agreements) required for the government to make future procurements of the technology. The following parameters apply to any proposed solution: 1.  The device must be easy to use and interpret. 2.  There must be a high degree of accuracy between 20% and 80% of the original battery capacity. 3.  The proposed solution must be transferable to battery configurations of the same battery technology other than the one used for the development of the prototypes. 4.  The device must be upgradeable to compensate for improvements in the battery chemistry technology. If the proposed solution is internal to the battery, the following parameters apply: 1.  The device must be able to withstand all government required (i.e. First Article) testing to which the battery is subjected per MIL-PRF-49471B. 2.  It shall have no detrimental impact on the shelf life of the battery 3.  Shall not bypass any of the internal safety features of the battery. 3.  The targeted cost for this device is not to exceed $10.  If the proposed solution is for a technology that is external to the battery, the following parameters apply: 1.  The device must withstand the rigors of a tactical environment.  The environmental tests (humidity, shock, drop vibration, etc.) specified in MIL-PRF-49471B are the types of tests that will be required. 2.  The device shall be small enough to be considered hand held 3.  The device shall not require any external (A/C) power source  4.  If the device requires a battery for power, it shall use a commercially available battery, or draw power from the battery being tested. 4.  The manufacturer of the battery shall be invisible to the device 5.  The targeted cost of this device is not to exceed $100.  Potential offerors are requested to submit a statement of their interest along with a brief (up to four pages) description of their proposed approach experience in the design and production of such devices within 21 days of the publication of this announc ement.  Comments related to this announcement, or organizations who wish to express their interest in this projected procurement should respond USACECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-P-PST (Gietter), Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703 or via E-Mail to marc.gietter@mail1.monmouth.a rmy.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) works in a voluntary partnership with private landowners to develop and sustain productive grazing lands in harmony with the environment.  The Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative (GLCI) has been an earmark in the NRCS budget. Recently the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (2002 Farm Bill) established the Conservation of Private Grazing Land (CPGL) program.  If funding is provided to carry out this program, it shall be provided through a specific line item in the NRCS annual appropriations. These funding options have and will continue to allow NRCS to provide technical assistance at the local level to private landowners wishing to develop, implement and maintain prescribed grazing plans.  The Wisconsin NRCS State Office is seeking through this notice, private sector assistance to meet the increasing demands for technical assistance on grazing lands.  The Wisconsin NRCS State Office intends to select private sector individuals, firms, entities, and/or public agencies (non-federal) to provide this assistance in cooperation with the agency.

If an individual, firm, entity, and/or public agency (non-federal) wishes to provide this assistance, but holds no applicable certifications, they are encouraged to state this in their response to this solicitation.  This Project will be Performance Based with minimal specifications and drawings.  Proposals from contractors will be evaluated on Technical Capability, Personnel Qualifications, Past Performance and Price.  This is a "Sources Sought Notice".  A separate "Request for Proposal" will be advertised for each of the four NRCS administrative areas in Wisconsin as soon as funding becomes available and surplus workload areas are identified.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Ship Visits for the Joint Tactical Radio System-Maritime/Fixed Site (JTRS-M/F) Cluster 3
<SOLNBR>SPAWAR Headquarters MKTSVY 23F36
<RESPDATE>012803
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Kelly Smith, Contract Specialist, 619-524-7351
<DESC>The objective of the Joint Tactical Radio System Maritime Fixed (JTRS-M/F) Cluster 3 program is to develop a Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) specifically for maritime and fixed site communication requirements. The purpose of the development effort is to create the next generation of Maritime and Fixed Site Communication system which shall provide growth capabilities through an open system architecture that enables technology insertion through evolutionary acquisition or preplanned product improvements (P3I).  JTRS-M/F shall be a multi-mode, multi-band, software definable radio system.  This will result in increased operational flexibility, enhanced interoperability and reduce life cycle cost. JTRS-M/F will be capable of transmitting voice, video, and data while operating in frequency bands from 2 MHz to 2000 MHz.  In order to facilitate an orderly and cost-effective migration from legacy systems, the new JTRS-M/F shall maintain backward compatibility with selected legacy systems and provide a seamless technological transition path to support the next generation radio room.  The JTRS-M/F will be defined as a complete end-to-end communications system with a combination of hardware elements, supporting software infrastructure, and government furnished waveform applications.  This system will include all RF distribution and control equipment to support voice, video, and data communications. The JTRS Program is a series of related but independent joint acquisitions. The Army is the Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) for the joint activities executed by the JTRS Joint Program Office (JPO).  The JPO is responsible for defining, developing, validating, and maintaining the Software Communication Architecture (SCA) and acquiring software waveform applications.  The JTRS-M/F (Cluster 3) Program Manager (Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, PMW 179) is responsible for developing JTRS-M/F hardware (with a SCA-compliant operating environment) and porting waveforms obtained from the JTRS JPO waveform repository to field the JTRS-M/F as a final consolidated product in support of the Fleet.  The key goals of the system are to ensure maximum scalability, modularity, and extensibility across all ship classes and fixed site platforms. This Federal Business Opportunities announcement invites potential offerors to nominate no more than two (2) representatives to participate in escorted visits of U.S. Navy warships.  This visit is tentatively scheduled for 3 February 2003 between 9:00 AM ? 4:00 PM in San Diego, CA.  The primary purpose of this event is to provide potential JTRS-M/F offerors information on the configuration of communication spaces on Navy warships for use in development of offerors? responses to impending the JTRS-M/F RFI and RFP. Total participation in this event will be limited to thirty (30) industry representatives, with preference given on a first come-first serve basis. The ship visits will be for U.S. citizens only.  Foreign nationals will not be allowed to participate in the ship visits. Due to the nature of the shipboard working environment, business casual attire is recommended for this event.  It is recommended that ladies refrain from wearing skirts and heels. Lunch will not be provided during the duration of the visit. Potential JTRS-M/F offerors interested in participating in this event must submit written request addressed to the SPAWAR POC listed above no later than 28 Jan 03.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - David Bodner, Contract Specialist, 619-524-7193
<DESC>This is an amendment of an earlier market survey. The Joint Operational Effects Federation (JOEF) is one of the Battle Management projects within the Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense Program.  The mission of JOEF is to provide an accredited, predictive multi-level resolution modeling and simulation system to determine and assess the impact of CBRN warfare on military operations.  This system will support (1) assessments and system requirements analyses in the acquisition process and (2) decision support for operational planning in a CBRN threat environment. JOEF will be developed in four blocks.  Block 1 will provide a modeling and simulation (M&S) analysis capability for assessing CBRN effects on fixed site aerial ports (i.e., fighter bases and APODs) operability and medical requirements.  Block 2 will expand the architecture to include seaports, SPODs and land-based fixed sites and provide capability to link output to theater and campaign level models.  Block 3 will further expand to include mobile land and littoral forces and provide link to manpower, logistics and training planning tools.  Block 4 will provide a full combat effects model for deliberate and operational planning.  All blocks will be compliant with the Common Operating Environment (COE) and with the High Level Architecture (HLA), and to be hosted on existing C4I systems (such as GCCS-x), as well as non-operational networks and standalone workstations We are currently examining the state of the art technologies specifically for Blocks I and II.  The purpose of this announcement is to invite inputs from interested parties as to the potential for use or incorporation of existing modeling and simulation capabilities.  We are interested in models that represent any one or any combination of the following: air bases and aerial ports of debarkation operations, seaports and seaports of debarkation operations, medical aspects of operations, and decontamination aspects of operations, that can run faster than real time and can run in an analytical fashion in a near-real-time mode.  The models will be used to evaluate how CBRN events affect operations.  We are particularly interested in models that are well-documented and are currently employed by customers or warfighters.  The interested party shall provide the system?s name, owner, contact information, developer if known and a brief description of the proposed candidate model as well as why the model/system is proposed, and whether the model is proprietary.   There is no limit on the number of candidate models/systems a party can propose; however, there is a ?one page per model/system" limitation. This is not a request for proposal.  SPAWAR is interested in determining what modeling and simulation products that might meet the above criteria exist in the marketplace.  This market-knowledge information will be used to help determine a strategy for a possible future acquisition. Please note that this is a re-release of a previous, recent market survey. If you have already submitted a response, then you need not resubmit unless you are adding ?medical? and/or ?decontamination? components (describing a capability to represent/model medical and/or decontamination aspects of operations).All interested parties shall submit their inputs to Mr. David Bodner, SPAWAR Contract Office (4301 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92110-3127), either via SPAWAR?s e-commerce web site or by e-mail (david.bodner@navy.mil) by COB 10 February 2003.

The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order for the maintenance support and engineering services for the Automated Message Handling System (AMHS) at USSTRATCOM to Telos Corporation19886 Ashburn Road, Ashburn, VA 20147-2358.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 514210.  This acquisition is to renew the existing software maintenance agreement.  The agreement will include product upgrades, telephone help desk support, engineering services, and training on software, which is strictly proprietary in nature.  The 55th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement was made because the introduction of alternate software would require complete re-training of developers, maintainers, and users which would not be a sound technical, security, or fiscal decision.  Questions should be directed to Mr. Lee Smales via email:  lee.smales@offutt.af.mil or by facsimile:  (402) 294-7280.

Bundles are rigged in such a manner that when placed on the balance point of the jump platform, the parachute is on the top of the bundle or on the side of the bundle facing the center of the aircraft, based on the largest dimension.  The maximum weight of the bundle is 500 lbs.   MESSAGE PICKUP (MPU) Operation. The MPU sites are selected to meet or exceed all ground and air selection considerations IAW TC 31-24.  The MPU operational procedures and techniques discussed below apply when using a STOL aircraft.  Aircrew shall be able to: Locate the PZ, and be able to identify the PZ, the authentication signals on the PZ, and both far and near recognition signals.  The reception committee must select an MPU that is accessible, secure, and safe.  Air considerations of Terrain: General area shall be relatively free of obstacles, flat or rolling terrain is preferred; however in mountainous terrain use large valleys, flat ridges, and level plateaus, avoid small pockets and valleys surrounded by obstacles such as tall trees and hilly terrain, very difficult for the pilot to locate, approach from any direction is preferred, or a minimum of 45 degrees open quadrant on approach and departure ends, MPU PZ having a single clear line of approach is acceptable provided there is a level turning radius of 2-kilometers/1 nautical mile.  Obstacles:  Terrain obstacles are rising ground or hills more than 153 meters (500 feet) higher than the PZ surface, should not be closer than 6 kilometers (3NM), and must be reported; artificial obstacles 90 meters (300 feet) in height above PZ level not on the issue map within a radius 5 NM must be reported; approach and takeoff clearance is based on the decent and ascent STOL aircraft ratio, or the so-called glide and climb ratio, 1 to 11 ratio, and also is the same ratio for mask clearance on MPU operations.  Size and surface area of the MPU site: MPU pickup zone is the safe area where the aircraft has descended to recovery altitude and is level, cleared to deploy the MPU retriever system, recover the MPU container from the MPU ground apparatus, and the aircraft initiates its ascent. The PZ area is the area where the ground committee places in the visual authentication marking system; the PZ minimum area in length is 92 meters (302 feet) and its minimum width is 23 meters (75 feet).  The PZ surface must be reasonably leveled, obstacle free, vegetation should not exceed 0.3 meters (1 foot).  In addition to the PZ length, mask clearance/ascent/descent ratio (1:11 for STOL aircraft) must be applied to the approach and departure ends in order to clear any obstacle surrounding the usable area.  MPU PZ shoulder safety zone is the area on both sides of the PZ's outer edge, parallel to the PZ's long axis (minimum length 92 meters) and is extended laterally an additional 24 meters (79 feet).  Its surface inside this given area must be clear of obstacles that exceed 1 meter.  The purpose of the two shoulder safety zones is to allow the pilot lateral maneuvers, free of obstacles, to prevent the retrieve anchor point from entanglement during his approach and departure of the MPU operation.  Additional ground consideration information is the surrounding area must be relatively free of obstacles to all a safe flight during approach and departure and to prevent entanglement of the retrieve hook and line.  6.
