<DESC>Repair Highwood/Baldy Road #8830 that was damaged during the heavy rains of 2005 that occurred in the Highwood Mountains.  This work consists of excavating embankment material from a nearby source and re-establishing the road bed.  Two armored relief channels will be constructed to channel the water across the road in case another similar weather event happens in the future.  These channels will require both Class 4 and Class 1 rip-rap as well as gabion baskets.  Road surface gravel will have to be provided and applied on the finished road sub-surface.  In addition, the existing pipe arch will require new embankment on the inlet, as well as new rip-rap on the inlet and outlet.  Rental of a small 6-way dozer is provided in the contract so the entrance road can be improved to allow material and equipment to access the site directly.  Magnitude of construction is between $25,000 and $100,000. Located at Armington Junction at the intersection of US Hwy 87 and 89, proceed northerly along State Hwy 331 for approximately 1 mile.  Then turn easterly up the County Road (#5024) on Armington Coulee road up this drainage approx 4 miles where it intersects the Forest boundary and turns into Forest Road #8830.  Project site is located about 1/4 miles above the forest boundary.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Austin Automation Center, Acquisition Management Services, Austin, TX  78772 has a requirement for LiveState solutions software.  The Government will consider other software that has the same functionality described below:  Specific capabilities of LiveState that, collectively, make it uniquely suited to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), HIPS project are: Provides disk-imaging based solutions that have proven to work with all major components of the ISS HIPS system (Win 2003 Enterprise, MS SQL, IBM RAID, ISS software), regardless of their file or disk usage patterns.   Permits recovery of selected files, folders, or the entire disk structure, restoring the complete system state (operating system, application, configuration, and datasets) to any of multiple “recovery points”, quickly recovering from most conceivable hardware or software failure scenarios.  LiveState has native support for partitioning of backup images.  This provides the capability to create backup images to specific sizes allowing for storage various forms of portable media for off-site storage (ex: DVD, tape).  LiveState has demonstrated superior capabilities in the ability to restore backed up images on systems with storage volumes that vary from the original in both configuration and in size.  This is a vital capability given the variations that exist at the hardware level (especially number of drives per system) for the VA HIPS deployment, also in the event of attempting to recover from large scale hardware failure this level of flexibility can reduce the amount of time required to restore a system (by removing the need to get an exact drive & RAID configuration match).  LiveState has demonstrated the capability to install the required components of their solution remotely.  Benefit being that implementation should not require travel cost for set up, and requires only minimal participation of local staff for initial configuration.  The recovery process for “bare metal” restores is both very simple and very flexible, providing support for both local and network based system recoveries.  AES encryption of backup data is available (and would be used for any backup data going off-site).  Network bandwidth throttling is supported to limit network impact of backing up very large datasets (ex: HIPS databases are typically 60GB or larger).  Intelligent automatic use of differential analysis and built-in compression reduces the size of backup datasets to much smaller than the original file space.  Supports restoration of a complete file system (with operating system) into a virtual machine (VMWARE) that would permit temporarily combining functions if an extended hardware outage was anticipated.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Austin Automation Center (AAC) plans to contract with Internet Security Systems on a sole source basis for the Host based Intrusion Prevention System RDP-1-MB and RSV-1-MB estimated at $4 million dollars for a 1-year contract with three 1-year options.   The security of Veterans Affairs (VA) critical information systems and the privacy of sensitive data depend upon the proper implementation of a standardized and comprehensive security configuration and management program for the entire enterprise.  The HIPS solution will adds a layer of defense at the application (host) level on every workstation and server with a HIPS agent installed.  With the information HIPS collects the VA is positioned to provide an adequate incident response capability to marginalize threats to workstations and servers. The software will provide a basic application level protection and proven network level signature protection on both inbound and outbound traffic and a basic tool to view high level data across various SiteProtector infrastructure instances.  In addition, it must provide meet the following VA-SOC requirements: •	Provide outbound network attack protection. •	Support for Windows NT/2000/2003, Solaris, Linux, AIX, and HP/UX server agents. •	Support for up to 20,000 nodes per instance. •	Must be intuitive
