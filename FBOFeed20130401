<CONTACT>Mrs. Shola Matthews-Aroloye, Contract Specialist , Email smatthew@aoc.gov - Mrs. Shola Matthews-Aroloye, Contracting Officer, Email smatthew@aoc.gov
<DESC><p>The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) has a requirement for the design, implementation, and maintenance of a customized off-the-shelf web-based advance reservation system to manage tours, special events, meeting spaces, and exhibits/educational events in the U. S. Capitol Visitor Center (CVC). The purpose of the system is to better manage demand and improve the visitor experience for Capitol tours, the U.S. capitol Visitor Center and orientation theatres. The system will be utilized onsite by the Visitor Division Services which includes call center reservationists and visitor assistants/ticket processing staff. The system will also be used onsite by tour coordinators in Congressional offices. These groups combined could amount to over one thousand daily users. Externally, the system will be used by tour companies, constituents, and visitors worldwide booking tours and other events in the Capitol with these groups combining to millions of users each year. Therefore, the AOC will be requesting proposals from companies to provide services to design, develop, provide training for, implement, maintain, and support a new web-based system to manage visitor and Congressional office advance reservations and bookings at the CVC.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall work with CVC staff to complete the following components of work: (1) Provide identified system development life cycle documentation; (2) Develop and/or customize advanced reservation and timed pass web-based system to fit requirements outlined in this document; (3) Create, host, and maintain reservation system web site; (4) Adhere to system performance measures; (5) Assist with the procurement and installation of necessary on-site equipment and insure system compatibility; (6) Assist with and oversee operator/user training and system testing and implementation; (7) Monitor system performance and adjust system as needed to meet requirements; (8) Maintain and secure system data; and (9) Provide ongoing system technical support, including operating customer and operator trouble phone lines. It is anticipated that AOC will purchase licenses for use of the contractor-owned system, semi-customized to meet CVC requirements. Though the typical fee structure for a reservation system is based on a per transaction or per reservation fee, the fee structure for this requirement should be based on concurrent users. A per transaction fee is not appropriate as there will be no charge for the timed passes or the advance reservations. Offerors must be able to provide a firm fixed-price for the licensing agreement based on an expected peak volume of concurrent users, based on their experience and the projected visitor volumes to be included in the solicitation. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This solicitation is unrestricted (that is, full and open competition). Offers will be evaluated on a Best Value basis. Offerors may be requested to provide a demonstration of their proposed software solution. Proposal details will be included in the solicitation. The AOC will issue a Request for Proposals in the form of a solicitation which will include a description of the work requirements, instructions to offerors, and required certifications. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The company to be selected shall be technically and professionally capable of providing all services to be described in the upcoming RFP.

<p>Item Description: VALVE SOLENOID</p>

<p>Unit of Issue: EA</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance @ Destination, FOB Destination</p>
<p>Destination Information: STOCK @ New Cumberland, PA</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: 360 Days</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.<br />Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 4/15/13. The Small Business size standard is 500 employees. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. Proposed procurement contains a 100% option for increased quantities. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved sources are: Pneudraulics, Inc (06177) and Rolls-Royce Corporation (63005) While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>

<p>FROM: TO:<br />1 - 5<br />6 - 10<br />11 - 15 <br />16 - 20<br />21 - 25<br />26 - 30</p>
<p>Reverse Auction: The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307</p>

<CONTACT>Lori Austad, Contract Specialist, Phone 406-495-3707, Email laustad@fs.fed.us
<DESC>This solicitation is for whitebark pine stand improvement and thinning activities on the Gardiner Ranger District of the Gallatin National Forest. The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, supplies (except those designated as Government furnished), and incidentals to perform all work necessary on the areas specified. All aspects of the work program shall be performed in an organized, systematic manner to assure services will be performed over the entire project area.
<p>Project is&nbsp;located in the Fisher Creek Drainage about 3 miles north of Cooke City, MT. T9S, R 14E, Sections 11, 12, and 13. There are about 92 acres of thinning non-whitebark species on the north side of the drainage (hereafter referred to as Sheep Mountain units) in 2 separate units. The Sheep Mountain units are comprised of a variety of tree species of various size classes. There is whitebark pine throughout, mixed with Engelmann spruce, lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir. Size classes include seedlings, saplings, poles, mature, and old growth in all species classes. The treatment units are interspersed randomly with untreated "controls"<br /><br />The project areas may be reached by Forest Service roads that are accessible by a standard two-wheel drive pickup truck equipped for mountain driving during the normal operating season, unless roads are wet, then use of a 4X4 vehicle will be required, except as noted below. The Government assumes no obligation to plow snow or do special maintenance to keep roads open.<br /><br />&nbsp;Due to the proximity to Yellowstone National Park, the project area is considered core habitat for grizzly bears. Bears are in the area throughout the summer, but not concentrated until mid-September when whitebark pine cones and hunter-killed carcasses are available in this area. Bears naturally avoid humans and are only a threat if surprised, especially if defending a food source or if humans get between a sow and her cubs. Careful management of food and other attractants, walking and working in groups and making noise (talking, singing), and carrying accessible bear spray are the best defenses when working in grizzly country. Make noise, but when running very noisy equipment, such as chainsaws, it may be prudent to have one person serve as a lookout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A complete solicitation package shall be available approximately April 15, 2013.</p>

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for rubber aerogels for space suit application: a quantity of 5 square samples of aerogel formulation 050313, and a quantity of 1 roll sample of aerogel formulation 050313. NASA/JSC intends to purchase these items from Aspen Aerogels, Inc. of Northborough, MA, as the original manufacturer and sole provider of the products. The high performance material was developed by Aspen Aerogels, Inc, under a competitively awarded NASA Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II contract, NNX12CE92P, in February 2012.	The results of the Navy Clothing and Textile Research Facility (NCTRF) study concluded that the Aspen Aerogel formulation (physical, thermal and mechanical properties) is best suited for space suit applications. Since Aspen Aerogels, Inc. developed the rubber aerogel formulation under a NASA SBIR Phase II, the specific recipe and fabrication processes are proprietary to Aspen Aerogel, Inc. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on the date listed above.

<DESC>Operational faults for mechanical systems in office buildings can negatively impact energy consumption, maintenance costs, thermal comfort for the occupants and environmental protection. Automated commissioning software programs are effective tools for the evaluation of mechanical systems in buildings. These software programs are designed to aid building operators and commissioning agents to perform semi-automated commissioning tasks. The software can be used to inject test signals to elicit system responses under different conditions and then to apply expert rules for analysis while requiring only rudimentary information on the hardware and operating set-points for the systems involved.
<p>In previous years, the Mechanical Systems and Controls Group of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed CITE-AHU.exe, and the BACnet Communications DLL (BCD), to facilitate the analysis and maintenance of air handling units in office buildings. The CITE-AHU software was developed in partnership with a French research lab (Centre Scientifique et Technique du B&acirc;timent, CSTB), while the BCD was developed solely at NIST. Since the development of CITE-AHU, NIST has been the only one to utilize it and no other vendors have developed upon or customized this software.</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is for the contractor to provide NIST with an updated version of the CITE-AHU application with a graphical user interface that provides all the functionality of the current Version 1.6. The new version shall be referred to as Version 2.0. This shall include the source code and all project files associated with the program. The source code as delivered must compile to the executable. The end software provided by the contractor shall provide the capability for analysis of multiple pieces of equipment in a building or network of buildings.<br />The period of performance will be for a period of 12 Weeks from the date of award.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541511 with a small business size standard of $25.0 million. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Quote (RFQ), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFP number NB732020-13-00728.</p>
<p>Potential offerors shall be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related Amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted. It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential Offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation. The Government will not maintain a mailing list.</p>
<p>Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to Jarreau.vieira@nist.gov or carol.wood@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>Offerors must be actively registered in the System Award Management (SAM) website at www.sam.gov, in order to be eligible to receive any resultant award.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates posting the solicitation approximately 10days after the date of publication of this notice.</p>
<p>Simplified Acquisition Procedures shall be utilized under the authority of FAR Part 13.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in cases when FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. Interested offerors should monitor both the FBO and the NECO site for the release of the solicitation. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided or mailed. Since this solicitation, and any applicable amendments, will be issued electronically, the Government is under no obligation to maintain a bidders mailing list.

Disclaimer: This pre-solicitation notice is for information only, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award contracts.
 The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept, proposals as a result of this synopsis. The Government will not reimburse the cost of any submission in response to this announcement -- the entire cost of any submission will be at the sole expense of the source submitting the information. If a solicitation is issued in the future, it will be announced via FedBizOpps/NECO and interested parties must comply with that announcement. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice. 

The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a single solicitation in March 2013 for the MK 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) Launcher Production Contract for (FY13-17) launchers, ancillary hardware, and associated support equipment in support of US Navy, AEGIS Ashore, and Allied Navy requirements.
  This solicitation will encompass separate mechanical and electronic MK 41 VLS requirements.  The Government may award separate contracts for the mechanical and electronic requirements from this one solicitation or the Government may award a single contract for both the mechanical and electronic requirements.

The MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) is installed onboard United States Navy (USN) surface combatants (CG 47 and DDG 51 Class ships) and multiple allied Navy platforms. MK 41 VLS stores, selects, prepares for launch, and launches STANDARD Missile, TOMAHAWK, Vertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket (ASROC), and Evolved SEASPARROW missiles. 

USN DDG 51 Class launchers consist of 12 modules composed of eight cells each.
 Allied Navy MK 41 VLS launchers typically consist of fewer modules with eight cells each. The FY13-17 requirements consist of up to 120 modules (10 USN DDG 51 Class shipsets), 3 AEGIS Ashore modules, up to 48 Allied Navy modules, and VLS upgrade kits and spares for Aegis Modernization (AMOD) and DDG modernization programs. The FY13 - FY17 DDG 51 Class module production requirements are planned to be procured via multi-year contracting concurrently with the FY14 AEGIS Ashore and Allied Navy requirements under the mechanical and electronic Firm Fixed Price contracts. The AMOD Mod kit requirements, starting in FY14, will be via annual contracting with base plus option requirements procured under the mechanical and electronic contracts.
 

The requirements under this possible effort are build-to-print and include, but are not limited to, design, fabrication and/or procurement and assembly of all special tooling and test equipment required to manufacture, assemble, and test MK 41 VLS Launchers, ancillary hardware, and associated support equipment. If separate contracts are awarded, the mechanical contractor will be required to procure all mechanical requirements outlined in the solicitation and deliver them to the electronic contractor as GFE after Government acceptance. NAVSEA will provide proprietary electronics as GFE to the electronic contractor. The electronic contractor will be required to procure all electronic requirements outlined in the solicitation and integrate these electronics with all GFE.

Award of the mechanical and electronic requirements will be determined by Lowest Price Technically Acceptable criteria under full and open competition as outlined in the solicitation.
 Offerors may propose on either the mechanical or electronic requirements or both.  If an Offeror elects to propose for both efforts, two individual and separate proposals must be submitted for each of the mechanical and electronic requirements; the Government will not accept a combined mechanical/electronic requirement proposal. NAVSEA may award one Firm Fixed Price contract for mechanical requirements and a separate Firm Fixed Price contract for electronic requirements, or one Firm Fixed Price contract for both the mechanical and electronic requirements. Offerors who propose for both efforts may be awarded either the mechanical or the electronic requirements, or both in the event that each individual offer is selected under the source selection criteria.
  

For example:

Scenario 1:
Offerors	  Mechanical	Electronic
A	  $10	         $15
B	  $12	         -
C	  -	         $14
D	  $15	         $22
Award	  Offeror A	Offeror C
Under this scenario, assuming all offerors are technically acceptable, mechanical requirements would be awarded to Offeror A and electronic requirements would be awarded to Offeror C.

Scenario 2:
Offerors	  Mechanical	Electronic
A	  $10	         $15
B	  $12	         -
C	  -	         $14
D	  $9	         $11
Award	  Offeror D	Offeror D
Under this scenario, assuming all offerors are technically acceptable, mechanical and electronic requirements would be awarded to Offeror D under one contract. Note that in the event that one offeror is selected for both the mechanical and electronic requirements, the mechanical requirements will be Contractor Furnished Equipment vice Government Furnished Equipment.

NAVSEA intends to fully fund all base requirements in FY14 at the time of award.
 Base contract requirements may include 108 USN DDG 51 Class modules, 3 AEGIS Ashore modules and 2 DDG AMOD kits. The anticipated contract period of performance for this requirement will be from the date of contract award, approximately March 2014, through approximately August 2020 (or upon delivery of all hardware). 

IMPORTANT: To be considered for contract award, all offerors must be a United States (US) company or an independent US subsidiary. However, subject to the applicable laws, regulations, and the terms of the solicitation, foreign contractors may act as subcontractors to U.S. prime contractors. The export of defense articles, defense services, and related technical data is subject to the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.

<p>This is neither a request for proposal nor a design competition. Since a contract may result in an award over $500,000, large businesses will be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan prior to contract award. The small business size standard North American Industry Classification System code is 541330, $14.0 million average.</p>
<p>This selection shall be in accordance with the Brooks Act, P.L. 92-582 (40 U.S.C. 1101-1104) and FAR Part 36. After the successful offeror(s) has been selected, the resultant contract award will be dependent on the conclusion of successful negotiations. Up to four (4) indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery (IDIQ) contracts may be awarded to the most highly qualified firms, one of which may be awarded to a small business. The contract period will be one base year from the execution of the contract with four additional option years</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory Pre-Qualification Requirements </strong></p>
<p>A. Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. Firms being considered for award under this acquisition are limited to "United States Person" bidders as defined in the Act. The Offeror must complete and submit as part of its pre-qualification package the pamphlet "Certifications Relevant to Public Law 99-399, Statement of Qualifications for Purpose of Section 402 of The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986." (The pamphlet is attached to this FEDBIZOPPS announcement and may be obtained from the DOS Contract Specialist listed at the end of this notice.) If a Joint Venture (JV) is formed, the company having 51 percent or greater interest in the JV must be the one completing the pamphlet. This is a pass/fail evaluated area. Submissions from Offerors who do not receive a pass rating in this area will not be further evaluated.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Organizations that wish to use the experience or financial resources of any other legally dependent organization or individual, including parent companies, subsidiaries, or other related firms, must do so by way of a joint venture. A prospective offeror may be an individual organization or firm, a formal joint venture (where the arrangement among the co-venturers has been reduced to writing), or "de facto" joint venture (where no formal agreement has been reached, but the offering entity relies upon the experience of a related U.S. person firm that guarantees performance). To be considered a "qualified United States joint venture person," every joint venture must have at least one firm or organization that itself meets all the requirements of a U.S. person listed in Section 402. The U.S. person co-venturer will be required to sign a guarantee making the U.S person individually responsible for performance of any contract awarded, notwithstanding the terms of any joint venture agreement.</p>
<p>B. Security Clearance Requirement. In order to be eligible to perform under this contract, selected firm(s), including all entities which comprise a JV and the JV itself, must possess or be able to obtain a Defense Security Service (DSS) Secret facility security clearance (FCL) with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M. Specifically designated personnel requiring access to classified information or to the Controlled Access Areas (CAAs) must possess a Secret personnel security clearance issued by DSS. Offerors already possessing the necessary FCL must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code, facility clearance and safeguarding level with the required pre-qualification documentation.</p>
<p>If a SELECTED offeror does not possess an interim or Final Secret FCL, the Department of State will sponsor the uncleared firm for an FCL at the time of selection. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the clearance. A period of ninety days from the date of sponsorship will be allowed for the uncleared firm to obtain the necessary FCL. After this period, the Government may, at its discretion, consider awarding the contract to another firm or awarding fewer contracts. No contract can be awarded until at least an Interim Secret FCL has been granted. Due to time constraints, the Government will not delay award of contracts to selected firms already in possession of Secret FCLs.</p>
<p>Foreign firms are not eligible for FCLs. Only U.S. firms organized and operating in the U.S. or Puerto Rico, or a U.S. possession or trusted territory, are eligible for facility clearances. U.S. firms which are determined to be under Foreign Ownership, Control or Influence (FOCI) are not eligible for an FCL unless actions (as directed and approved by DSS) can be taken to effectively negate or reduce associated FOCI risks to an acceptable level. This process often takes more than the 90 calendar days allotted for clearance. Information on the clearance process can be found on the DSS website, at http://www.dss.mil, under Industrial Security.</p>
<p>Offerors that meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit the required Stage 1 documents. Firms shall submit four (insert appropriate number) hard copies and one digital, PDF version on CD. The submission shall incorporate tabs to clearly identify the different solicitation requirements. Offerors may find a copy of the SF-330 at the following website: <br />http://contacts.gsa.gov/webforms.nsf/0/21DBF5BF7E860FC185256E13005C6AA6/$file/SF%20330.pdf .</p>
<p>A copy of the Prohibited Countries List, from which offerors may not choose engineering team members, can be obtained from the Contracting Officer listed in the last paragraph of this announcement.</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned that the Department may consider only the information in the submission, and that obtained from additional sources concerning past performance. The <br />Department reserves the right to request clarifications or additional information.</p>
<p>Offerors are advised that inaccurate or incomplete submissions, or those not meeting the submission requirements, may result in immediate disqualification.</p>

The information in this notice is based on the best and most current information available to date. This information is subject to change and is not binding to the Government. Updated information will be provided in future announcements and posted electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) homepage at www.fbo.gov. The Government shall not reimburse the costs of preparing responses to this request for information / sources sought notice.</p>
<p>The 22d Contracting Squadron (AMC), McConnell Air Force Base (AFB), Kansas, intends to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) in the April 2013 timeframe for the acquisition of BASH &amp; Wildlife Control services to be performed at McConnell AFB. The estimated contract period including all options is 1 August 2013 through 31 July 2018. The successful contractor shall provide all personnel, supervision, management, and other items necessary (excluding Government Furnished Property) to provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, permits, licenses, and any other items and/or services necessary to perform all operations involved in providing BASH &amp; Wildlife Control. The primary emphasis of this program is to prevent bird airstrike hazards. However, the contractor shall provide a comprehensive wildlife control program to mitigate the risk of wildlife at McConnell AFB, KS. Wildlife encountered includes, but is not limited to: birds, foxes, dogs, skunks, snakes, turtles, coyotes, and deer. The program may include, but is not limited to, the use of trained birds of prey, dogs, pyrotechnics, harassment, trapping, relocation, airfield patrol, and perimeter fence monitoring and as set forth in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) for said services. All work shall be performed in accordance with all federal, state, and local regulations, commercial standards, and the terms and conditions specified within the Performance Work Statement (PWS).

Depending upon the response to this notice and other market research, 22 CONS may limit the competition to a specific category of small business at the exclusion of all other potential business concerns.

<DESC>This is the public notice for a small purchase acquisition over $25,000.
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), located at MacDill AFB, FL intends to issue a fixed price purchase order to Honeywell Aerospace, 121 Whittendale Drive, Moorestown, NJ for (1) Automated Flight Following (AFF) Tracker Service and (2) 24/7 world-wide satellite phone service via the Iridium network for various NOAA aircraft. It is intended that the order will be issued for one year and 4 option years. It is intended that a purchase order will be issued by May 10, 2013.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is for: (1) 24/7 world-wide AFF reports utilizing the equipment already installed on aircraft for 1 JetProp Commander, 4 DeHavilland Twin Otters, 1 King Air, 2 P-3 Orions, and 1 Gulfstream GIV. Installed models are Skyconnect FLIGHDECK with Tracker AFF model 1616-450-01A, Skyconnect TRACKER AFF model 1616-050-05, and Skyconnect TRACKER AFF model 1616-050-05A. AN AFF report is required to be sent every two minutes of flight and accessible via a secure website such as www.aff.gov. (2) 24/7 world-wide satellite phone service for 6 of the 9 aircraft via the Iridium network with Honeywell Skyconnect FLIGHTDECK satellite phone equipment already installed on aircraft. NOAA requires the same equipment in all aircraft to maintain consistency in the fleet.<br /><br />The aircraft equipment on board are Skyconnect devices. Skyconnect was bought by EMS Aviation which in turn was bought by Honeywell. The Skyconnect devices are configured to operate only with the Honeywell proprietary internet display utilities.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is for items for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994 (Title VIII PL 103-355) as implemented by FAR 12.102 &amp; 13.106-1(b). EAD-KC intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Honeywell Aerospace based on the following reasons: 1) Skyconnect devices are configured to operate only with the Honeywell proprietary internet display utilities, 2) a change out of devices would be time consuming, add expense, and add unacceptable risk of nonperforming service, 3) Honeywell purchased EMS Aviation which previously purchased Skyconnect. Refer to attached sole source justification.</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses. However, all responses received within 10 days after date of publication of this notice of intent will be considered by the Government. Responses can be faxed to Ron Anielak at (757) 664-3618 or sent via email to ronald.f.anielak@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible business sources may submit a response which shall be considered by the agency. Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications to provide the required service; and sufficient information that describes or demonstrates the firm's technical capability to provide the specified service. Only affirmative responses to this notice will be evaluated to the extent necessary for the Government to determine whether it is feasible to conduct a competitive acquisition considering parts, cost of testing, standardization, consistency, and price. Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on demonstrated technical ability to successfully provide the required service as stated herein.</p>
<p>NOAA, EAD-KC requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM). No purchase order can be made to a company not registered in SAM. For additional information and to register in SAM, please access the following web site: http://www.sam.gov. In order to register, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505.</p>

<p>NOAA has a requirement for satellite communications circuits to transmit seismic data from remote sites to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu, HI. The existing C-Band 70 Mhz system is installed in Honolulu, Hawaii, and operates on New Skies NSS-9 transponder GLL10/GLR10 RHCP using an Anacom Transceiver 20WEC and Radyne DD2401 receive-only modems.<br /><br />The communications network consists of eleven sites (10 remote seismic stations in the Pacific -- Wake Island; Midway Island; Easter Island; Funafuti; Johnson Atoll; Samoa, Apia; Kanton Island, Kiribati; Christmas Island, Kirabati; Tarawa Island, Kirabati; Port Moresby, New Guinea -- and a test station in Albuquerque, NM) and the downlink site at Honolulu, HI. <br /><br />To ensure continuity of operations, we seek a 0.62Mhz contiguous band space segment on New Skies NSS-9 transponder with the same L/R polarization. The current configuration is as follows:<br /><br />Location Carrier Center Frequency Info Rate Downlink Freq PTWC Modem Freq FEC<br /><br />Funafuti 6401.8135 29K 4176.8135 86.8135 0.500<br />Johnston Atoll 6401.8525 29K 4176.8525 86.8525 0.500<br />Apia, Samoa 6401.8925 29K 4176.8925 86.8925 0.500<br />Kanton 6401.9315 29K 4176.9315 86.9315 0.500<br />Christmas Island (Kiribati) 6401.9705 29K 4176.9705 86.9705 0.500<br />Tarawa 6402.0095 29K 4177.0095 87.0095 0.500<br />Port Moresby 6402.0485 29K 4177.0485 87.0485 0.500<br />Albuquerque 6402.0875 29K 4177.0875 87.0875 0.500<br />Honolulu (outbound) 6402.1500 64K 4177.15 0.500<br />Midway 6402.2125 29K 4177.2125 87.2125 0.500<br />Wake 6402.2515 29K 4177.2515 87.2515 0.500<br />Easter Island 6402.2905 29K 4177.2905 87.2905 0.500</p>

The Submarine Escape and Rescue Program Office (PMS391) located at the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) in Washington, DC is looking for companies with the capability to manufacture, test and produce one Submarine Rescue System-Rescue Capable System (SRS-RCS) Ship Interface Template Set (SITS).  The SRS-RCS SITS are a component of the Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System, and are designed to enable rapid physical installation, integration, and alignment of deck-mounted Pressurized Rescue Module System elements on a Vessel of Opportunity (VOO).  The SITS are a combination of jigs and structural supports that accommodate a variety of vessel deck types (unevenness); protect equipment from standing water on deck, and provide alignment, structural, and mechanical attachment to the VOO deck.
 

Sources must have weld procedures to be used in the manufacture of these SITS approved by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), and must provide a history of fabricating hardware that was ultimately classed by ABS or similar classification society. 

All interested parties are encouraged to submit company and product literature, white paper and/or other pertinent information such as past history.  Past history should include a description of similar hardware fabricated by their organization with performance parameters, summary of testing performed, test reports, and an estimated cost for price of test articles and production units, for the Governments consideration by 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on 29 March 2013.

This sources sought synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.
 The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.

All information marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.

Your interest in this response is appreciated.  Questions regarding this announcement may be directed to the Contracting Officer, Mrs. Janet Crowe, SEA02411, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue, SE Stop 2030, Washington Navy Yard DC 20376-2030 or janet.crowe@navy.mil.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) <br> Packing and Crating Schedules I and II <br> Fort Bragg, NC <br>  <br> The Government is requesting information from the small business community regarding two upcoming requirements for packing, containerization, and local drayage for Schedules I and II.   <br>  <br> Several small businesses have expressed interest in both requirements in the past. However, after solicitation closings for these types of requirements the Government has noticed of a lack of participation. <br>  <br> As a result, the Government is seeking information from the small business community in an effort to better understand the lack of competition among small businesses under NAICS code 488991, Packing and Crating. <br>  <br> The Government is requesting information related to the following questions: <br>  <br> Why would a small business indicate interest in the requirement and then not follow through with a quote, proposal, or bid? <br>  <br> Is there a lack of understanding of the requirement that discourages small businesses from providing a quote, proposal, or bid? <br>  <br> Is there something about the requirement that discourages small businesses from actually participating in the solicitation process? <br>  <br> The Government is interested in gathering an insight from the small business community in an effort to generate competition. <br>  <br> General information for the requirements can be found at the U.S. Transportation Command website located at http://www.transcom.mil/dtr/part-iv/appendix.cfm. <br>  <br> The Government is interested in any input from the small business community as well as questions regarding the requirement. <br>  <br> When replying to this posting please contact Contract Specialist Scott Bertacini at scott.r.bertacini.civ@mail.mil and Contracting Officer Heather D.

<DESC>DETERMINATION TO SOLICIT FROM A SINGLE SOURCE 	 Solicitation No.: R13PS30143 Project Name: Modbus Interface Kit 
1.	Agency and Contracting Activity. Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Regional Office, Hoover Dam. 2.	 Name and Address of Single Source.  Accusonic, 28 Patterson Brook Road, Unit 1, West Wareham, MA 02576. 3.	Description of Supplies/Services and Estimated Cost. The requirement is for the purchase of Modbus Interface Converter, KD485 manufactured by KK and custom programmed by Accusonic Technologies. Accusonic Technologies manufactures flow meters that are currently in place and used to report and calculate operational data on the SCADA system. In order for the new server, iFIX (manufactured by GE), to be able to communicate with flow meters, a Modbus interface converter is required. KD485 is custom programmed by Accusonic to communicate with Hoover flow meters. 
4.	Description of Circumstances, including why only one source is reasonably available.
Accusonic Technologies software design is proprietary, there are no other companies that can manufacture this product and there are no authorized distributors. Therefore, Accusonic is the sole source for the software needed on the KD485.  See attached letter from Accusonic stating that they have proprietary rights to this software and that they are the sole source distributor of this product. 
5.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost. 
 Accusonic's price was compared to other product's prices and it shows that Accusonic's price fell within the price range of those similar products. Therefore, Accusonic's price is determined to be fair and reasonable to the Government. 
6.	Description of Market Research. 
Market Research shows that the similar products listed above do not have the protocol that is required by the iFIX software. Accusonic has the protocol to communicate with Accusonic manufactured flow meters, therefore, equal products cannot be manufactured or modified to meet these requirements. Based on the factors stated in section 4 and section 6, Accusonic is the sole source provider for this product.

<DESC>It is the intent of the US Fish & Wildlife Service to enter into a firm fixed price purchase order for the kenneling and care of 1 canine to Go Doggie, Home Doggie under the US Fish & Wildlife Canine Program for a base + 4 option years.  This award was set aside for small business, local area to a kennel close to the US Fish & Wildlife Service, Office of Law Enforcement in Rosemont, IL.  Local competitive offers received.
This purchase order will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  The NAICS Code is 812910 Pet Care (except veterinary) services.  
The establishment of a national wildlife inspection canine program is intended to complement the existing wildlife inspection program by providing canines to help detect illegal wildlife in international shipments.  The health and care of the canine is of extreme importance to the canine program.  Go Doggie Home Doggie (GDHD) is a facility located at 1381 E. Oakton Street in Des Plaines, II.  GDHD is located 2.1 miles from the Rosemont, II FWS OLE, and takes 5 minutes to get to via vehicle.  The close proximity of GDHD permits the canine handler to spend very little time transporting the canine from its kenneling location.  Thus, allowing the canine handler to be more productive by performing inspections with the canine and keeping the canine proficient through the required training.   In addition, the close proximity of GDHD will permit FWS OLE to spend less money on fuel, and be more environmentally friendly.
When inspecting the available locations to kennel the FWS canine, GDHD stood out. Because of the philosophy of personal care and limited enrollment, GDHD is uniquely designed to provide the most attentive, individual, and interactive care for the FWS canine.   GDHD is affiliated with a 24-hour, on-call, veterinarian, and GDI-JD provides a full-time and overnight staff certified in Red Cross Pet First Aid and CPR.
GDHD is registered in SAM.GOV and is a Woman Owned Small Business.   
If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please contact Valarie Reinholz via email at valarie_reinholz@fws.gov  by Thursday 3 pm EST.

ix.	VA Master Construction Specifications shall be used as the basis for the production of specifications to suit the separate work requirements of the individual items contained in the project.  Extraneous material that does not apply to the project must be deleted.  While relevant items should be covered in full scope to assure compliance by the contractor and quality construction, the use of notes and/or pictures on the drawings both to accentuate important items in the specifications, and/or to take the place of lengthy written specifications for routine or simple items is encouraged.  Entire specifications for simple projects of low monetary value may be by notes on the drawings. Projects should be designed with LEED certification in mind. Certification may or may not be pursued.

x.	The A-E will also provide a date of publication for all industry, association and Government standards referenced in the specifications.  The date used will be the current publication date of the standard at the time of design.  It is not acceptable to state "use the latest or current issue".

xi.	The new renovation will be matched with the hospital standards. The interiors design will require development of space program to meet the VA standard and users' requirements.  The A/E is required to meet with the users to develop three (3) conceptual design plans with different space configuration including cost estimates for VA approval and selection. The A/E will prepare equipment layouts for new equipment as required by the equipment's manufacturer specifications and drawings.

4.	The Architect/Engineer shall survey the area and verify existing space, study adequacy of square footage for each function, analyze utility systems and verify as built drawings. Existing drawings may not be complete, and the Government neither warrants nor guarantees the accuracy of these documents. The A-E is to conduct its own independent and complete investigation of the currently existing conditions without reliance on any Government-Furnished or provided plans/drawings and specifications.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ERDC Contracting Office intends to solicit and award on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.500 to Heartland Cement Sales, Co., of Bethlehem, PA. The Contracting Officer has determined that only one source is reasonably available. This requirement is to provide Flowable Fill Material that matches material purchased previously for consistency. A copy of the Sole Source Justification is as follows: <br>  <br>  <br> SUBJECT: Sole Source Justification Requirement for Purchase of Flowable Fill Material <br>  <br> 1. The Airfields and Pavements Branch (APB) of the US Army Engineer Research and Development <br> Center (ERDC), Vicksburg, MS, has been tasked by the US Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) to <br> develop design curves relating rapid-setting concrete cure times, rapid-setting concrete cap thickness, and <br> sustained sorties. The design curves will help predict the life of a crater repair when rapid setting <br> concrete is used as a capping material over cementitious backfill materials such as flowable fill. <br>  <br> 2. Flowable Fill Material is required for the testing. Six previous demonstrations, Critical Runway <br> Assessment and Repair (CRATR), Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD), Limited <br> Operations Utility Assessment (LOUA) 1, LOUA2, final Operations Utility Assessment (OUA), Cold <br> Weather Demonstration for Concrete, Wet Weather Demonstration, and Large Crater Demonstration have <br> validated the effectiveness of modern expedient repair equipment, tactics, techniques, and procedures <br> (TTP) and materials for ADR operations, including Utility-Fill Step 750. Heartland Cement Sales Co. is <br> the sole manufacturer of Utility-Fill Step 750. <br>  <br> 3. In order to maintain consistency and complete the ongoing testing, the flowable fill material must be <br> purchased through Heartland Cement Sales, Co. The APB requests that 168 tons of material packaged in <br> 3,000 lb supersacks be purchased.  <br>  <br> A RFP/RFQ WILL NOT be issued based on this notice. <br>

      (iii) The Government will evaluate offers in accordance with the policies and procedures of FAR Part 25.  For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation.
  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--
    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
    (1) Listed end products.
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin

    (2) __ Outside the United States.
  (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
    [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--
      (i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;
      (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003- 4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and
      (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.
    [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003- 4(d)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--

      (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
      (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
      (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
      (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
  (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)
    (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
    (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR), is soliciting quotes for services for Assessing Gene (mRNA) Expression.</p>
<p>Statement of Work (SOW)</p>
<p>The FDA/NCTR require services for assessing gene (mRNA) expression changes in human cell lines using Next-Generation sequencing technology (Next-Gen). Next-Gen is required in order to provide full coverage of all the mRNA expressed in these cells after exposure to tobacco smoke condensates. The Illumina sequencing technology is required since other projects at NCTR have used this sequencing chemistry/technology and want to be able to make one to one comparisons between the data without introducing bias that may occur with the use of different technologies. A total of 240 samples will be analyzed to compare the effect of tobacco smoke condensates on the cellular expression of the gene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specific deliverables/timelines:<br />a) Once it receives the samples, the vendor shall complete the sequencing within 1 month and send out the following data summary reports in electronic format within the following 2 months:<br />1. Raw data file for each sample<br />2. A table of the flow cell statistics outlining the quality and yield of the flow cell(s) where samples were clustered and sequenced<br />3. QC files regarding any presence of artifact/duplicate sequences, along with base distributions and qualities<br />4. A tab-delimited text file with collapsed and normalized counts for each detected gene and isoform for each specimen<br />5. An alignment file (BAM format) containing best alignments of each read to genome.<br />6. De-multiplexing of Illumina barcodes, if applicable<br />7. Provision of a tab-delimited file containing normalized counts of each gene</p>
<p>The Government will provide a minimum of 1.25 ug of total RNA and the Government intends to provide 240 samples within 6 months of contract award.</p>
<p>b) Preparation of libraries from the mRNA that can be run on the Next-Gen platform.</p>
<p>c) Sequencing of the libraries using Illumina sequencing technology. The parameters for the sequencing are paired end reads, 50 bases minimum per read, and a depth of coverage of at least 12 million read pairs per sample.</p>
<p>d) Alignment of the read data to the current reference human genome and transcriptome with transcript identifications assigned from the human Gene table as the definition for both gene and transcript level expression, modified so that transcript IDs are guaranteed to be unique. At least 85% unambiguous alignment to the transcriptome and genome is required.</p>

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<p><br />52.217-5 EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (JUL 1990)</p>
<p>Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>52.225-17 EVALUATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY OFFERS (FEB 2000)</p>
<p>If the Government receives offers in more than one currency, the Government will evaluate offers by converting the foreign currency to United States currency using a conversion rate of $1.00 = JPY 82.4035.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONST-M-7400 BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD (JUN 2006):</p>
<p>This is a lowest price technically acceptable award. All technically acceptable proposals shall be treated equally except for their prices. Failure to meet a requirement may result in a proposal being determined technically unacceptable. A proposal must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Technical Acceptability - Initially, the Government technical evaluation team shall evaluate the offeror's Technical Requirements on a pass/fail basis, assigning overall ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable. The proposals shall be evaluated against the following subfactors:</p>
<p>1. 10% Conceptual Design. The offeror's 10% conceptual design will be evaluated for the extent to which it meets the requirements of CONST-L-7300 and the extent to which it demonstrates the offeror's technical understanding of the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>2. Proposed Construction Approach. The offeror's proposed construction approach will be evaluated for the extent to which it meets the requirements of CONST-L-7300 and for the soundness, workability, and the degree to which it demonstrates the offeror's technical understanding of the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>3. Design-Build Schedule. The offeror's proposed Contract Progress Schedule (AF Form 3064) or GANTT chart will be evaluated for the extent to which it meets the requirements of CONST-L-7300 and the extent to which it demonstrates the offeror's ability to deliver a usable facility within the specified time constraints in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Note to Offerors: A technical proposal rated Unacceptable will not be considered for award. There will be no point scores assigned, only Acceptable or Unacceptable. In addition, the Government shall use the following technical acceptable/unacceptable ratings definitions when assigning technical ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable (Table 1).</p>
<p>Table 1, Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>B. Price Evaluation. Lastly, the Government shall rank all technically acceptable offerors by price, in accordance with 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness, realism, and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>C. After evaluation of both the Technical Requirements and Pricing Submission as specified in the solicitation, the Contracting Officer will select that responsible source whose offer is technically acceptable, considering only the criteria included in the solicitation, and which offers the lowest evaluation price.</p>
<p>D. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in Section L. Incomplete submissions (e.g., a submission that fails to include one or more documents required by CONST-L-7300) will not be reviewed and therefore will be determined unacceptable. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal such as technical acceptability. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>E. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. <br /><br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONST-M-7401 REJECTION OF OFFERS</p>
<p>(a) Offer on All: Offerors must propose on all item(s). Failure to do so shall be cause for rejection of offer. (Applies only to solicitations containing more than one (1) line item).</p>
<p>(b) Separate Changes: Separate changes in any form, are not solicited. Offers containing separate changes will be rejected.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

<p>The Naval Special Warfare Development Group (NSWDG) has a requirement to procure the following:</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification: The Naval Special Warfare Development Group (NSWDG) anticipates an award of a sole source firm fixed price contract (FFP) to Strategic Systems, Inc. of 3434 Central Parkway SW, Decatur, IL, 35603 for the procurement of an upgrade to the Close Quarters Combat Recording (CQCR) system audio hardware and software at the Demolition Training Complex (DTC). The CQCR is utilized for after action review, video storage, special effects, audio and communication with the control room. The system was installed by Strategic Systems Inc. (SSI) in 2005-6. This requisition is for upgrading the components in the boxes that are used to broadcasst audio and for the end users to contact the control room. The components in the box must be compatible with the proprietary software installed by SSI. If a non compatible design was installed the software for the CQCR would have to be modified or rewritten to accommodate at a significant increase in cost.

A technician can be trained on the one system and be technically proficient to operate any of the three separate control rooms.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

BRAND NAME OR EQUAL (JAN 2008)
(Note: As used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)
(a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.
(b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.
(c) 
(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:
(i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and
(ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.
(2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:
(i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and
(ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.
(3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered.

PROVISIONS/CLAUSES:  The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference (provisions and clauses may be obtained via the internet: http://farsite.hill.af.mil): 
The provision at 52.212-1 Instructions to offerors- Commercial applies to this acquisition
52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, technical, past performance and price considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

BASIS OF AWARD:  1) The government intends to issue a firm fixed price contract or multiple awards to the responsible Offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation evaluation factors. 
EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: 
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the Offer that meets the technical aspects of the solicitation.  Competing offeror's technical aspects will be evaluated as significantly more important than past performance and price considerations. The lowest price proposal may not necessarily be selected; likewise, the proposal receiving the highest technical rating may not necessarily be selected.  Offerors who propose to perform the work for an unrealistically low price will not be considered for award. Where applicable, the techniques and procedures described under FAR 15.404-1 will be the primary means of assessing proposal reasonableness. An offeror's proposal shall represent the offeror's best efforts to respond to the solicitation. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. All such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.Offeror's must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: 

A.	Technical: Technical can be measured by the offeror's ability to perform requirements to meet technical, specifications, contract terms and conditions, and all local, state, and federal regulations as related to performing projects. 

B.	 Past Performance Confidence Assessment: 
1) Past Performance, the offeror shall provide relevant performance information on all offerors based on (1) the past and present references provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources as well as questionnaires. Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving contracting support that is similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. Past Performance that does not meet the recency requirement, will be excluded from evaluation. 
2) Past performance will address areas pertaining to the following attributes to which an assessment will be made: 
3) Quality: The quality of work can be measured by how well the offeror conformed to or met contract requirements, specifications and standards of good workmanship (e.g. commonly accepted technical professional, environmental, or safety and health standards.) 

. 
TABLE 1- PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS 
Rating 	Description 
SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
LIMITED CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 
NO CONFIDENCE 	Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. 
UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE 	No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. 

4) Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offeror's with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating ?Unknown Confidence, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. 
5) In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFP. For each effort evaluated, a relevancy determination of the offeror's present and past performance, including joint ventures, subcontractors and/or teaming partners, will be made. In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated. Relevancy will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy determination for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevancy. The following relevancy definitions apply: VERY RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. SOMEWHAT-RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs involved some of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires. NOT RELEVANT: Past/present performance programs did not involve any magnitude of effort and complex.
6) Recent past performance is defined as past performance on contracts within the last three years from the issue date of this solicitation. Past performance for contracts exceeding the timeframe for this definition of recency will be excluded from evaluation. 
7) If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a ?Substantial Confidence? performance rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. 
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer,  mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
Offeror to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items, Offeror must submit a completed copy of this provision with its proposal for the proposal to be considered. See https://orca.bpn.gov/ for online submittal);

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established six permanent regional offices in the following locations: San Jose, Costa Rica; Bangkok, Thailand; Dakar, Senegal; Nairobi, Kenya; Pretoria, South Africa, and Budapest, Hungary. The sub regional offices are in Almaty, Kazakhstan; Jakarta, Indonesia, and Cairo, Egypt.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs) who are supported by the Regional Advisors (RAs). The Program Officer's primary responsibility is to assist the PRAs or RAs with assessment and monitoring of existing or evolving crises, maintenance of partner relationship, and facilitation of award management activities. The Program Officer (PO) will also work closely with the Agreement Officer's Representative (AOR) for all assigned awards and the Regional Team, both of which are located in OFDA/Washington (OFDA/W). It is expected that the PO, under the guidance of the PRA or RA, will also coordinate closely with Embassy and USAID Mission staff where applicable.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the service of a Program Officer for its regional office in Nairobi, Kenya to effectively manage OFDA's humanitarian assistance programs in that area.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Program Officer will primarily assist with coordination and management of OFDA's humanitarian emergency efforts in the area of responsibility, under the direction of the PRA or RA. This position requires substantial daily coordination with several OFDA staff in-country and in Washington, DC, as well as with representatives from other USAID offices, embassies and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style. The Program Officer must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.<br /> <br />The Program Officer's responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as the principal in-country point of contact for OFDA assistance awardees operating in the area of responsibility and advise the OFDA Agreement Officer's Representative (AOR) on award issues from development through implementation.</p>
<p>&bull;	In close coordination with the PRA, RA, Regional Coordinator (RC), and Disaster Operations Specialist (DOS) in Washington, DC, the incumbent works with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs), and United Nations (UN) agencies to develop proposals for OFDA (including grant amendments and extensions) and to implement OFDA funded programs. He/she ensures that draft proposals are in compliance with "OFDA's Guidelines for Proposals." Review concept papers and proposals, and provide recommendations/comments to OFDA for final funding determination.</p>
<p>&bull;	Participate, as requested by the PRA or RA, in a broad spectrum of assessments of emergency conditions and assist in the development of programmatic recommendations and implementation mechanisms for OFDA's response programs.</p>
<p>&bull;	Maintain regular contact with OFDA grantees, as well as other UN agencies, IOs, and NGOs. As requested by the PRA or RA, meet regularly with donors, host government officials, United States Government (USG) agencies, and others on humanitarian issues in order to explain, advocate for, and advance OFDA's priorities and to help coordinate USG and international humanitarian activities.</p>
<p>&bull;	In close coordination with the PRA or RA, travel frequently to assess, evaluate and monitor conditions at OFDA project sites and to make recommendations for interventions in the area of responsibility. Report to OFDA's AOR and the PRA or RA on the quality of the grantee's work, noting deficiencies, attributes and evolving operational conditions.</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide regular reporting, through official cables and other means, on issues related to the humanitarian situation in the area of responsibility. Provide overviews of patterns and trends in the humanitarian situation and keep the PRA or RA current on response issues. Provide regular reports on site visits, meetings, general atmospherics and other issues that impact humanitarian relief efforts. Assist the PRA or RA with the communication of this information to OFDA/W.</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare agendas and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in humanitarian assistance activities in the region of assignment; serve as a critical component of a Disaster Assessment Response Team (DART), Response Management Team (RMT), or backfill other staff members in the overseas office, in response to crisis situations.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:</p>
<p>The Program Officer will report to the Principal Regional Advisor for the region of assignment or his/her designee and maintain close coordination with the Disaster Operations Specialist in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:</p>
<p>The supervisor will set overall objectives and will work with the Program Officer to determine deadlines and work priorities. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and perform with moderate direction in responding to humanitarian emergencies as part of a fast-paced office environment.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting.

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<br />&emsp;<br />ATTACHMENT 2</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate, OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Regional Specialist position was developed because  (1) USAID's portfolio of countries facing various forms of fragility or crisis has increased, making OTI's experience and skills that much more relevant, timely and sought after; (2) the Transformational Diplomacy strategy has placed new, growing, and immediate regional demands on USAID in the region, including increased engagement in conflict, crisis and transitional assistance programming, which in turn has increased demand for OTI's assistance and advice; and (3) as USAID's lead operational unit for crisis intervention programming, OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and explore earlier countries that face possible political crises in order to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints and to be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>
<p>As an OTI senior official in the region, the Senior Regional Specialist will represent and serve as a liaison between the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) and a wide array of individuals and institutions including USAID Field Missions, other Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) office representatives, regionally based officials from the State Department, the Department of Defense, and other agencies of the U.S. Government, international organizations, and the non-government community abroad on political transition, conflict and post-conflict issues in the region.</p>
<p>The Senior Regional Specialist will visit, as necessary, ongoing OTI programs in the region as well as proposed and potential country program sites, serving as OTI's senior official in the region, and may be called upon to support other regions. The Senior Regional Specialist will serve as the &lsquo;agent' of the OTI Team Leader and, when designated, will have supervisory authority when working with OTI Country Teams.</p>
<p>The incumbent will train, mentor, backstop, and support OTI Country Representatives, Deputy Country Representatives, and bullpen staff.  S/he will report to one of OTI's five Regional Team Leaders serving Africa, Afghanistan/Pakistan, Asia, Middle East, and Latin America/Caribbean. The Senior Regional Specialist will mentor and train OTI Country Teams on the OTI business model, procedures, minimum program requirements best practices and help determine the learning and training needs of in-country staff.</p>
<p>The Senior Regional Specialist will participate and contribute to broader office policy and process discussions and promote state-of-the-art transition programming. The Senior Regional Specialist will cultivate and share best practices found in the field with OTI's Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) Team.  Through coordination with the ABC team the Senior Regional Specialist will stay abreast of current thinking, policy determinations and lessons learned and best practices from other regions.  Through on-the-ground knowledge of OTI country programs, the Senior Regional Specialist will contribute to the refinement of OTI's learning and training strategy, training regimes, and materials for staff in country programs as well as office surge staff, known as the Bullpen.</p>
<p>The Senior Regional Specialist will be a leading point of contact for engagements in the region of the OTI Support Unit (OSU), and the Program, Learning and Innovation division (PLI), which includes the ABC and Program Office teams.  S/he will help steer such engagements from the field as part of the overall OTI regional team's work, and will advise them on program specifics and individual TDY terms of reference.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Senior Regional Specialist in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Senior Regional Specialist requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Senior Regional Specialist requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The Senior Regional Specialist is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Senior Regional Specialist is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The Senior Regional Specialist has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Senior Regional Specialist is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader, with additional reporting responsibilities required for the Director of the USAID Regional Development Mission, the DCHA/OTI Senior Regional Specialist will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure effective and well-managed OTI country programs.  The Senior Regional Specialist will achieve this by providing independent analysis of the OTI country program's effectiveness and management, and by providing mentoring, training, and consultation for  the OTI Country Representative, Deputy Country Representative and other members of an in-country Senior Management Team (including implementing partner staff where appropriate) about the OTI business model, programming methodology, applicable historical references, observed personal and corporate lessons, and overall advice at strategic, programmatic and activity levels for the improvement and success of the OTI program.</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide advice to the OTI Regional Team Leader about the direction and implementation of country programs, the performance of in-country staff.  Work with the Regional Team Leader and relevant country team to devise strategies for the improvement and success of OTI programs.</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor regional developments as they relate to OTI's mission and mandate.  Provide ongoing analysis and provide regular reporting to the Regional Team Leader on current political developments, security concerns and other pertinent information from the region for informed decision-making.</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OTI's representative, regional focal point, and liaison for new country start-ups, strategic analysis and dialogue with senior U.S. government officials and representatives throughout the region.</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, lead and/or contribute to assessments for possible new country start-ups, and steer new country analysis for OTI.</p>
<p>&bull;	Support ongoing OTI programs in the region on a temporary duty (TDY) or remote basis, including but not limited to serving as an Acting Country Representative or Acting Deputy Country Representative when required.</p>
<p>&bull;	Actively support learning and training in OTI by linking, contributing to and refining observed lessons from the field and program and personnel requirements to the main body of OTI knowledge through the ABC team.  Act as a conduit for both observed best practices in the field to the ABC team for the general improvement of learning and training within OTI, as well as a channel from the ABC team to country programs of minimum requirements, best practices and state of the art thinking for transition programming.</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide technical assistance and support to regional and bilateral missions experiencing political transition, conflict, and post-conflict issues.</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide expertise to OTI regional teams and the Senior Leadership Team on OTI strategic planning.</p>
<p>&bull;	Travel to other current or potential OTI field locations and Washington, D.C., if required, to provide expertise on OTI field programming through assessments, country program reviews, or consultations.  Provide said consultations and assessments on best practices and lessons learned, to develop guidance and training materials. Travel may also be required to attend regional conferences and workshops.  Provide readouts when practicable and appropriate to the regional and ABC teams.</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as assigned by OTI/Washington in support of OTI's world-wide mission, including, if required, other representational duties in support of OTI programs.</p>

<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:</p>
<p>The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.

The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(d)  Offerors should note that a review of the Contracting Officer?s decision will not extend GAO?s timeliness requirements.  Therefore, any subsequent protest to GAO must be filed within 10 days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action. <BR> <BR>USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM ? STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B. DESTINATION  (NOV 1991) <BR> <BR>Sellers must comply with all terms and conditions as outlined in the attached solicitation. <BR> <BR>WIDE AREA WORKFLOW PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS. <BR> <BR>AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS. <BR> <BR>

<p>The AFNWC/PKA, Hill AFB, Utah, is seeking potential responsible capable sources to provide, deliver, install, test, and demonstrate a new Telemetry Integrated Processing System (TIPS). This TIPS system is unique to Minuteman III (MMIII) operations out of Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB). The TIPS is used to process and display telemetry data for Range users and Range Safety. Telemetered data from missile launches is collected at the 30th SW telemetry receiving sites and retransmitted via microwave links to the TIPS. Receiving and recording of raw data will continue to be provided by the Range. The new TIPS will need to be installed at VAFB in building 6601 and will need to interface with the existing Telemetry Analog Equipment Room (TAER).<br />Please see attached Sources Sought Synopsis for complete details of this announcement.</p>
<p>Previously, a technical requirements document was attached to this announcement. However, that&nbsp;attachment&nbsp;has been removed. The government no longer requests feedback on that&nbsp;technical requirements document. In addition, questions on the&nbsp;questionnaire (in the attached Sources&nbsp;Sourght Synopsis)&nbsp;that needed the technical requirements document to be answered were removed. Answers to those questions are no longer needed. Additional time has been granted to respond to this announcement due to this change. If you have already submitted a response, and would like to change it, have the changed response submitted by the new response date. If you have submitted a response and would not like to change it, please notify the primary point of contact listed in this notice to verify that no change will be made to your response. If you have not responded to the notice, but would still like to, submit your response by the new response date.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Pre-Solicitation Notice<br />RFP-PCC-0022<br />CAR XV</em></strong></p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has two requirements for the management and operation of a contractor-owned/contractor-leased, contractor-operated correctional facility. <strong>Each requirement must fall within the range of a&nbsp;minimum of 1,565 to a maximum 2,000</strong> low security, adult male inmates that are primarily criminal aliens ordinarily with 90 months or less remaining to serve on their sentences.</p>
<p>An offeror may submit for only one requirement or both requirements.</p>
<p>Requirement A<br /><br />Proposed institutions shall house inmates in a secure correctional institution that meets BOP standards as set forth in the resulting solicitation/contract. The proposed facility must be located in one of the following states: Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey or New York. <strong>This requirement must fall within the range of a minimum of 1,565 to a maximum 2,000&nbsp;</strong> low security, adult male inmates that are primarily criminal aliens ordinarily with 90 months or less remaining to serve on their sentences.</p>
<p>An offeror awarded a contract must be ready to accept inmates at an existing facility within 150 days after contract award, or no later than April 1, 2016, at a rate specified in the resulting contract. Any construction, expansion, or renovation must not interfere with or delay the arrival of inmates as required by the solicitation/contract. The inmates shall be housed in a secure correctional institution that meets BOP standards as set forth in the resulting solicitation/contract. <br /><br />Requirement B<br /><br />Proposed institutions shall house inmates in a secure correctional institution that meets BOP standards as set forth in the resulting solicitation/contract. The proposed facility may be located anywhere in the continental United States. <strong>This requirement must fall within the range of a minimum of 1,565 to a maximum 2,000 </strong>low security, adult male inmates that are primarily criminal aliens ordinarily with 90 months or less remaining to serve on their sentences.</p>
<p>An offeror awarded a contract must be ready to accept inmates at an existing facility within 150 days after contract award, or no later than April 1, 2016, at a rate specified in the resulting contract. Any construction, expansion, or renovation must not interfere with or delay the arrival of inmates as required by the solicitation/contract. The inmates shall be housed in a secure correctional institution that meets BOP standards as set forth in the resulting solicitation/contract. <br /><br />Both Requirements<br />The BOP intends to award a Performance-based, Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity type contract. The Government will be required to order and the contractor required to furnish at least the established minimum quantity of 90% of the accepted number of contract beds for each contract year. Additionally, the contractor will be required to house a daily population of up to 15% over the accepted number of contract beds for each contract year. The contract award will have a potential term of 10 years, consisting of one four-year base period and three (3) two-year option periods. Contract performance will be governed by a performance-based work statement based on American Correctional Association Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions.</p>
<p>Offerors are prohibited from housing non-BOP inmates within the same fence perimeter; however, multiple populations at a prison complex with separate fence lines is acceptable. Additionally, services received from or provided to the resulting contract shall not be shared with other contractual obligations.</p>
<p>Award selection shall be made on a best value basis for the Government. The BOP has established a decisional rule criterion requiring all offerors to clearly demonstrate they have verifiable corporate experience operating a secure correctional/detention institution for a continuous three-year period as of the date the Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued. Information will be required from offerors regarding both existing and anticipated environmental impacts and the environmental condition of the proposed site where the institution is located. Environmental documentation and other related information will be required with the submission of the proposal in order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). A NEPA analysis will be performed for each proposed contract action. An Environmental Impact Statement will be required prior to award. The offeror's proposal cannot contain any proposal or action that could, in the sole opinion of the Bureau of Prisons, significantly impact the quality of the human environment as determined by either: (1) a consideration of the offeror's proposal under the National Environmental Policy Act; or (2) lack of said consideration due to the failure of the offeror's proposal to contain sufficient information for the Bureau to conduct a complete analysis.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Prisons intends for performance to begin on either Requirement A or Requirement B no later than 06/01/2015.</p>
<p>The contractor shall obtain the appropriate authority from state or local law enforcement agencies to use force as necessary, (consistent with applicable policies of the federal government) to maintain the security of the institution. Proof of this authority shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer within 90 days after the deadline for receipt of proposals.</p>
<p>This requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis, open to both large and small businesses. Faith-based and Community Organizations can submit offers equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the BOP.</p>
<p><br />The solicitation will be available on or after <strong>04/16/2013</strong>, with an anticipated closing date for receipt of proposals on <strong>05/31/2013</strong>. The solicitation will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunity website http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The site provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. All contractors doing business with the federal government shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The website for CCR is www.ccr.gov. The North American Industry Classification System code for this solicitation is 561210, Facilities Support Services. Interested parties requiring further information should email Michael Bodine, Contract Specialist, at mbodine@bop.gov or Timothy Barnes, Contract Specialist, at tbarnes@bop.gov.</p>

<DESC>This modification revises the Pre-Solicitation Notice of 28 Mar 2013 to correct the "Classification Code" from 61 to 59, change the Navy Sponsor POC and change the NAVSEA Security POC.  Therefore, the Pre-Solication Notice is restated in its entirety as follows:

The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a small business set-aside competitive solicitation for the development of the Common Acoustic Cabinet (CAC).   This requirement also includes production of thirty-two (32) CAC units, 300,000 hours of engineering services and Orders.  The resultant contract will include development and four (4) option years for production and engineering services.  The CAC is one of many MIL-SPEC, environmentally qualified, water-cooled cabinets employed by the Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Insertion (A-RCI) Program to house submarine sonar acoustic processing capabilities on SSN 688, SSN 688I, and SSGN Class submarines.
  The CAC provides upgraded signal processing capability and is reconfigurable to support multiple acoustic and array sensors and will allow refreshes to mitigate obsolescence and/or incorporate Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) improvements. The CAC will implement Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products and Non-Developmental Items (NDI).  
NAVSEA intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in the late May 2013 or early June 2013 timeframe with proposal due approximately 60 days after RFP issued.  The RFP and related files will be listed under solicitation number N00024-13-R-6269 and will be issued electronically.  The solicitation will be made available only through the internet at:

	https://www.neco.navy.mil/ 	or 	http://www.fbo.gov/.
  

Offerors are hereby notified that from time to time, the Government may post additional information to either website relating to this solicitation (e.g. responses to questions, amendments, etc.). It is the Offerors responsibility to check the websites for any such information. 

The Navy has established an Electronic Technical Information Center (E-TIC) to serve as the repository for unclassified technical information related to the CAC Program.  The performance specification and other related controlled files will reside at the E-TIC.  The Classified information is available at the reading room located at SEA CORP in Newport, RI.  Information from Industry Day held on Dec 11, 2012 is available on the E-TIC.
  

In order to gain access to the unclassified E-TIC, Offerors must have a valid PKI certificate and be able to supply your Joint Certification Program (JCP) Certification JCP #________.  If the Offeror has a valid PKI certificate, access to the E-TIC is gained as follows:  First fill out an AIMTC Account Request form at the following link:  https://www.aimtc.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/aimtcmanagement/request.asp.  The following fields must be completed as follows:  the branch or Code you support is PMS401, the Navy Sponsor POC is Tim Nguyen, the Navy Sponsor Code is NUWC NPT Code 1533, the justification for your need to know is Prospective Offeror for the CAC Competition and check IQ9  A-RCI E-TIC as the area for which you have a need to know.
  When the request form is complete, hit the send button at the bottom of the page and you will be notified that the request is being processed.  An AIMTC User Account Information email will follow that provides you E-TIC login and password information.  

Companies/individuals who are interested in obtaining information from the classified reading room must submit a written request to the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Security POC, Tin Nguyen at 401-832-6195; fax number 401-832-4908, e-mail timothy.h.nguyen@navy.mil.  The written request must include data on the company facility and specific individual(s) requiring access as follows: facility security clearance level, issuing Government agency, and expiration date; facility security office phone/fax numbers; facility storage level, cage code, and complete destination address personnel for whom access to classified data is requested to include full name; security clearance level, issuing Government agency, and expiration date; date of birth; and city/state of birth.
  Once a prospective Offerors need-to-know and security clearance is verified, reading room details will be provided.

DFARS 252.204-70004, Alternate A, Central Contractor Registration applies.  Lack of current registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information may be obtained at www.ccr.gov.

Any firm lacking the requisite security clearance and intending to respond to this procurement shall, within ten (10) calendar days of issuance of the RFP, request initiation of such clearance action, in writing, from the Naval Sea Systems Command, Code:  SEA 00P3, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue SE Stop 1020, Washington, DC  20376-1020.  Appropriate clearance action in accordance with established procedures will be initiated by the Naval Sea Systems Command, but the Naval Sea Systems Command does not represent that such action can be completed and clearance granted prior to expiration of offers.
 

Once the RFP is issued, the Government will consider comments received.  The Government does not commit to providing response to any comments or questions.  All such questions should be received in writing within fourteen (14) calendar days after release of the RFP to allow the Navy adequate time to prepare and issue responses to all Offerors prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals.  Only questions transmitted electronically will receive a response.  The Navy will continue to accept questions up to the closing date and time of the solicitation; however, time may not permit responses to be issued prior to proposal receipt.  Questions received after the time set forth above will not result in an extension to the proposal due date.
  It is the Governments intention that questions and responses will be distributed electronically to all Offerors.  Each question shall include the document name, document date, specific page, paragraph, clause or other definitive citation requiring clarification.  The subsequent revision to any specification or RFP based on comments received remains solely at the Governments discretion.

The government will not respond to any specific questions or comments submitted in response to this synopsis or information provided as a result of this synopsis.  

This is not a request for proposal, a promise to issue a request for proposal, or a promise to contract or commitment of any kind.  This information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award a contract.
  The Government is not responsible for any cost incurred by industry in responding to this notice.

<DESC>Presolicitation Notice Questions and Answers: 

Q1: Can you tell me if these services are currently (or previously) being performed by a contractor? If so, could you please provide the Incumbent name as well as the contract number? If this is a new requirement, is there an estimated dollar value, or NTE value associated with this requirement?
A1: The incumbent contract for the mechanical requirements is BAE Systems Land & Armaments under contract N00024-11-C-5301. The incumbent for the electronic requirements /final module assembly and test is Lockheed Martin Maritime Systems and Sensors under contract N00024-11-C-5302.

Q2: I am interested in submitting a quote for the MK 41 Vertical Launching Systems.
 I would like to know, however, whether I should send a NDA for all of the personnel in my shop prior to getting the TDP; or if you would rather me send NDAs for only the personnel that would actually have access to the information for the bidding process and then, if awarded the contract, send NDAs for the remaining personnel.
A2:  Any and all personnel who will access the TDP shall submit an NDA. If additional personnel will require access to the TDP only in the event a contract is awarded, then the contractor shall submit NDAs for those individuals as appropriate at the time of award, prior to those individuals accessing the TDP.    

Q3: On 7 August 2012, the Government had conducted an MK41 VLS Launcher Production Industry Day to increase industry understanding and appreciation of MK 41 VLS Launcher design, Fleet utilization, safety features and production requirements and to provide industry the opportunity to ask questions and obtain feedback from the Navy.
  With the recent changes to the FY13-17 planned procurements, does the government intend to conduct another industry day to further brief the industry on these upcoming production requirements?
A3: At this time, the Government does not intend to conduct an industry day for N00024-13-R-5332.

Q4: In response to questions received from the previous MK41 VLS Launcher Production Industry Day, the Government had indicated that, At this time, the Government's intent is to limit participation of each subcontractor to no more than 20% of the overall effort based on the contract's total dollar value. The latest pre-solicitation Number: N0002413R5332 does not indicate the Governments intention to limit participation of each subcontractor as indicated above.
 Will the formal solicitation include a limitation percentage as previously indicated?
A4: Under N00024-13-R-5332, the Government does not intend to limit subcontracting; however, the final solicitation will set forth the Navy's requirement. The previous synopsis and industry day for MK 41 VLS under N00024-12-R-5320 has been cancelled and is no longer applicable or valid.

Q5: If/when a formal solicitation is released, what length of time does the Government expect to allow for submission of a proposal? It is expected that a competitive proposal of this magnitude should warrant 60 to 90 days allowance.
A5: The solicitation will govern proposal submission time. The Government intends to allow approximately 75 days for proposal submission from the date of RFP release.

Q6: The Government NDA indicates that, The MK 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) Technical Data Package (TDP) for Reference (a) will not be provided until each individual contractor employee requiring access to the TDP signs and certifies compliance with the attached Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). It is expected that this proposal will require approval from upper-management officials prior to submission of offer.
 This may include reference material to the Governments MK41 VLS Technical Data Package (TDP). If this is the case, will the Government accept additional NDAs after 27 February 2013 for witness of the proposal/offer?
A6: The Government will accept NDA requests after 27 February 2013.

Q7: Do I have to have special access to get to Attachments N0002413R5332 N00024-13-R-5332  FY13, I am unable to open.
A7: No special access is needed.  Attachments are publicly available on FedBizOpps.  Attachments will open when clicked on.

Q8: When will I receive a countersigned NDA?
A8: The Government will not return countersigned NDAs to the potential offeror.

Q9: When can we expect access to the Technical Data Package?
A9: The TDP will be provided to the potential offeror after all the required documentation is received, and approved, by the Navy.
  In accordance with the synopsis, potential offerors interested in receiving the export controlled technical data will be required to submit a copy of a valid DD Form 2345 (Military Critical Technical Data Agreement) in addition to the NDA forms.   After all required documentation is approved, the Navy will begin the process to provide the TDP.  At this time, the Contracting Officer will inform the offeror, via email, that its NDA(s) and DD Form 2345 have been approved and that TDP will be provided.  It is anticipated that the TDP will reach the offeror approximately 3 business days after the approval of all required documentation.

Q10: What is the government's preferred method of accepting this information from the offeror (i.e.
 electronically, hard copy, etc?)  If hard copy is preferred, please specify if copied originals are acceptable.
A10: In accordance with the synopsis, information should be submitted via email to Mr. David Lubrano, Contracting Officer, at david.lubrano@navy.mil and Mr. Edgar Lee, Contract Specialist, at edgar.lee@navy.mil.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION	 <br>  <br> 1.0 CONTRACT INFORMATION <br> General.  This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR 36.6 and EP 715-1-7, Architect-Engineer Contracting in USACE.  This acquisition will be used to procure highly specialized services required to provide continued Architect-Engineer (A-E) design services in support of the Facility Repair and Renewal (FRR) Program.  The FRR program provides quick response to repair/renewal situations relating to the architectural, mechanical, electrical, civil, structural, instrumentation, communications, security, safety, systems, and cost, as well as environmental and hazardous materials abatement areas of Government facilities.  Sometimes the Government accomplishes the FRR projects through other design/build contracts; however, some projects will require that an AE prepare a design package (work plan) that will then be executed by a construction contractor under another solicitation.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Huntsville Center is one of the Army's leaders in studies as well as execution, and partners with the Corps' project delivery teams, regional business centers/divisions, stakeholders and geographical districts to provide expertise and the highest quality research facility, life cycle support to the Department of Defense (DoD), other Federal agencies and foreign governments.  In order to accomplish this objective Huntsville Center proposes to award a Restricted Small Business Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC). These awards will be ID/IQ contracts, with a one (1) year base and four (4) one (1) year options; Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders will be negotiated, with secondary criteria being used as a tie-breaker, if necessary, in ranking the most highly qualified firms. It is anticipated that this acquisition will result in award of a target of three (3) contracts, with the Government reserving the right to award more, less, or none at all if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  Task orders (TO) will be awarded with FY13-17 funds, subject to the availability of funds, with a North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code of 541310.  The total requirements expected to be awarded under the Facility Repair and Renewal Program on A-E contracts are anticipated to total approximately $9,000,000 over a period of five (5) years.  This acquisition is a small business set-aside restricted competition.  Contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) and have the professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the required services.  In accordance with FAR 52.236-23, Responsibility of the Architect-Engineer Contractor, the A-E Contractor shall be responsible for the professional quality, technical accuracy, and the coordination of all designs, drawings, specifications, and other services furnished by the Contractor under this contract.  The Contractor shall, without additional compensation, correct or revise any errors or deficiencies in its designs, drawings, specifications, and other services.  In accordance with DFARS clause 252.236-7009, Option for Supervision and Inspection Services, the Contractor may perform any part or all of the supervision and inspection services for the construction contracts resulting from the A-E services, however, the A-E contractor will not be responsible for the direct performance of the construction itself.  In accordance with FAR 52.219-14, at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor on a contract reserved for small business.  <br>  <br> 1.1 In accordance with FAR 36.209, the A-E Contractor and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for DoD construction contracts that relate to any A-E Task Orders awarded under this contract.  Potential Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCIs) are also governed by FAR subpart 9.5. <br>  <br> 2.0 PROJECT INFORMATION <br>  <br> 2.1 Description of Work.  The Facility Repair and Renewal A-E contracts provide all services required to prepare plans, specifications, work plans and other supporting documents necessary for execution of the FRR projects issued by task order.  As part of the design effort the contractor may be required to survey the problem areas, evaluate and recommend solutions.  The level of detail and format of the design packages may vary dependent upon the complexity of the FRR project.  A complete design, including construction drawings, specifications, a bid schedule, an order of work clause, a construction contractor submittal register, quantity and cost estimated, construction cost estimates, a proposed construction schedule, design analyses and calculations, a design document report, an engineering considerations and instructions report, and a draft operations and maintenance manual shall be developed for each project.  In addition to project designs the contractor may be required to conduct studies, investigations, surveying and mapping, tests, evaluations, consultations, comprehensive planning, program management, conceptual designs, value engineering, construction phase services, soils engineering, drawing reviews, preparation of operating and maintenance manuals, preparation of parametric estimates, equipment and systems commissioning and other related services.  <br>  <br> 2.2 Location of Work.

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 18 - Contracting Office is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>The purpose of this task order is to obtain technical professional services to promote Electronic Health Records (EHR) and other forms of Health Information Technology (HIT) included in the HITECH Act.
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) HITECH initiative will promote Health IT and specifically the EHR incentive program to individuals and organizations who are eligible for the programs (hospitals, Medicare eligible professionals, Medicaid eligible professionals and Medicare Advantage organizations), as well as to states, state and local elected and appointed officials, and legislative and state technology bodies. The goals of the outreach include supporting the adoption and meaningful use of the health IT available through new technologies, such as electronic health records and state health information exchanges (HIE); and supporting participation in the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs to ultimately improve patient outcomes, quality, efficiency and transparency of health care.</p>
<p>The research projects initiated under this task order shall also support CMS's communication campaign to promote the use of CMS information channels by providers, states, beneficiaries, health care influencers/information intermediaries such as partners, stakeholders, and those who implement our programs. The campaign will also make accurate information about the EHR incentive program available through CMS channels, such as products, website, etc. In addition, CMS will help promote the adoption of EHRs and other HIT by the provider community through states, state and local elected and appointed officials, and Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<p>The purpose of Modification 000001 is to:<br /><br />Obligate additional funding to add a fourth audience to the SOW - Practice Managers.</p>
