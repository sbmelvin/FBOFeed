<DESC>The Spanish Ministry of Defense (MoD) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the procurement of new fuel pumps for the tank farm at Cartagena Naval Base.

The Spanish MoD is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. The Spanish MoD intends to use the one stage bidding procedure. 

Conditions on economical solvency and technical expertise of the bidders will be requested, such as requirements on equipment, materials, and adequate and proved expertise on petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) infrastructure work. It is not foreseen, however, to use a Questionnaire to evaluate tenders technically or economically or to do a previous selection among the firms involved in the ICB. 

Project construction will be awarded as a single package to a single contractor. The implementation cost has been estimated at Euro 1.7 million ($2.4 million) without taxes.

The reference to identify the project will be JAL (DIN) 3NB07013. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the reference IFB-SPAIN-3NB07013.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The current POL facilities at Cartagena Naval Base are over 50 years old. They were designed to supply fuel for ships (F-77 and F-76) and aircraft (MO GAS and AV FUEL) operating in the Western Mediterranean. Currently, only F-76 and F-44 are being stored. The installations were designed to be independent of shore support and two diesel generators, each of them capable of the total pumping load requirement, were used to ensure electric power and its availability in an emergency.

Fuel is stored in seven tanks. Two of them, used for F-76 fuel, are buried inside a rocky mountain and connected through a service tunnel. The pumping station is also inside the tunnel, but the old pumps are out of use and the electric generators for powering these pumps were removed several years ago. Fuel transfer from these tanks, from the concrete bunkers in the tunnels to the pier, is currently done by gravity by means of a 20? pipeline. That results in poor flow of discharge. Fuel discharge from oil tankers to the POL tanks is carried out by the pumping system of the ships.

The other five tanks, used for both F-44 and F-76, are semi-buried in the mountain slope. Each of them has its own fuel pumps on top of the tank to discharge to the piping system. 

On the pier, there are a main distribution manifold and five supply stations. Fuel facilities include ancillary equipment such as a drainage system, a fire-fighting system, and ballast discharge equipment.

Inside the tunnel, the pipes are not covered. Outside, the pipes run beneath the ground to cross a road. At the pier, the pipes are buried in a trench. Along the pier a gallery distributes all the services, including fuel. All of these pipelines, especially the buried sections, are in bad shape and need replacement.

A complementary fuel supply (both F-76 and F-44) can transferred from the semi-buried tanks to the pier. The piping used for this transfer is also in bad condition.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The scope of this project is to replace the pipes as required and to increase the current supply capacity up to 1600 m3 per hour.

Two new fuel pumps will be installed with a capacity of 800 m3/hour each, suitable for current marine fuel needs. (Standard NATO F-76, equivalent to MIL-F-16884 J, according to MIL-STD 3004)

These pumps are to be used for pumping fuel (F-76) from the existing storage tanks in the tunnels or for internal fuel movements, but not for pumping fuel from the semi-buried tanks, nor for the supply of aviation fuel (F-44).

Current fuel filters and fuel meters will continue in the installation.

Emergency electrical power supply is required to ensure the required availability. Since the primary power source will be the city main grid, only one emergency generator of 450 kVA is needed to reach an acceptable level of redundancy in the electric power supply, 

Life cycle support of the new POL services is the responsibility of the Spanish Navy and is not part of the ICB.

The execution of this project and the related documentation are classified as NATO UNCLASSIFIED.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the IFB has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date to request a Declaration of Eligibility from the U.S. Department of Commerce: 16 October 2007

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) to those on the Bidders List: early November 2007

3. Anticipated date for signing of contract: 1st quarter 2008

4. Estimated Date of Start (EDS): 1st quarter 2008

5. Estimated Date of Completion (EDC): 3rd quarter 2008 (six months from starting date)

<DESC>Title: National Agriculture Greenhouse Gas Inventory Reporting of Soil Organic Carbon and Soil Nitrous Oxide Emissions Posting Date: August 9, 2007 Procurement Office: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Administrative Contract Service Center (3803R), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW Washington, DC 20460 Response Date: August 24, 2007 THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT, NOT A RFQ The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Climate Change Division (CCD), Program Integration Branch intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.303-1 (a)(2), to Colorado State University (CSU) in Fort Collins, CO.  The staff at CSU, are uniquely qualified to complete this work for EPA.  The CSU team has developed extensive expertise in utilizing the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change methodology for estimating soil carbon stocks in the US and remains the only group of scientists who have successfully applied the IPCC methodology to the existing US activity data for generation of national soil carbon estimates.   EPA has utilized the soil carbon estimates generated by the CSU team over the last eight years in the annual publication of the US Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks.  The Century/Daycent models, which will be used for the foreseeable future to estimate soil carbon and nitrous oxide flux from soils, were developed by a team at CSU.  Members of the CSU team have recently run these models for the US, and the soil carbon and soil nitrous oxide estimates generated from the models were utilized in 1900-2005 US Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks.    Members of the team have been working for over seven years to develop the methodology and associated documentation for the soil carbon estimates and for two years on the soil nitrous oxide estimates used in the US Greenhouse Gas Inventory.  The team contains the Lead Author on the soil carbon chapter of the recently completed 2006 IPCC Guidelines, amongst many other IPCC publications, which are used as the methodological basis for developing the greenhouse gas estimates in national inventories including the United States?.  For these reasons, the proposed team is exceptionally and uniquely qualified to undertake these tasks and present the best value to the US Government. The purpose of this acquisition is to support the national agriculture greenhouse gas inventory reporting of soil organic carbon and soil nitrous oxide emissions.  The contractor will provide the inventory estimates and the required documentation for soil organic Carbon stock changes in croplands and grasslands, and soil Nitrous Oxide emissions from all managed lands disaggregated to the state level.  The contractor will provide the Agency with text, tables and summary spreadsheets documenting the data, methods and results from the soil Carbon and Nitrous Oxide analyses; agricultural soil Carbon and Nitrous Oxide methodology annexes for inclusion in the US GHG Inventory; maps and appendices depicting variation in state-level carbon stock changes and Nitrous Oxide emissions; data inputs for the Common Reporting Format Tables; a Quality Control/Assurance Report for each inventory assessment; and responses to reviewer comments from the expert and public review comment periods. This is not a request for quotation.  No contract will awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  All inquires and concerns must be addressed in writing to U.S. EPA, Stacey Wolejko (3803R) 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20460, or to facsimile number (202) 565-2560, or sent by email to wolejko.stacey@epa.gov.  Response to this notice must be submitted within fifteen (15) days after this electronic posting.  Consideration of responses is solely within the discretion of the Government, generally for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please include your number, point of contact, address, and telephone number.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.

12. DESCRIPTION:

The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) plans to award a follow-on to the current contract FA8819-07-C-0002 to Northrop Grumman Corporation for space control architecture analysis, from 1 November 2008 to 31 October 2009 (1 year), with a possibility of four additional 1-year options.  Approximate value for one year is estimated at $14M.

The intent is to award a sole source follow-on contract to Northrop Grumman under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  This Space Control Architecting Contract will support the analysis of systems, capabilities, and concepts within the space control mission areas of offensive counterspace (OCS), defensive counterspace (DCS), space situation awareness (SSA), and space command and control (C2).  This follow-on contract will ensure maximum leverage of developed capabilities, consistency in assessment approach, long-term continuity, and short-term responsiveness to requirements for critical analysis that refines and expands upon work performed to date.  In addition to program support via papers and studies, ongoing architecture support includes development, coding, and integration of various commercial and government software models and applications to provide assessments of potential space control capabilities and their relative operational impacts.  This sole-source, follow-on contract to ongoing efforts will permit the Government to efficiently ensure that the mission area is fully integrated and that there is sufficient continuity with one contractor for the Government to realize maximum benefits.

The Government believes Northrop Grumman is the only company capable of providing subject requirements.  This is based on the Government?s need to provide analysis consistent with the current approach without interruption and substantial duplication of cost thats not expected to be recovered through competition.  The current analysis approach includes a multi-year, multi-spiral modeling and simulation project with source code to which the Government does not own full data rights.  The reverse-engineering required to implement source code from previous spirals will cause an unacceptable interruption to analysis, and purchasing the data rights to the source code will represent a significant, duplicate cost to the Government.  All interested parties can submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) no longer than 10 pages and containing the following information: technical description of the offeror?s experience and knowledge of Air Force Space Command space control systems, Concept of Operations (CONOPS), and architecture; description of facilities and equipment intended for use in support of this effort; and proof of security clearances for government evaluation.  Interested parties must have experience with analysis of Air Force Space Command military systems and capabilities, to include development of analysis software and tools, and must have detailed knowledge of Air Force Space Command space control systems, capabilities, and their operations across all mission areas (OCS/DCS/SSA/C2).  To mitigate schedule risks, interested parties must have strong experience with ongoing efforts and developments in space control and must be ready to initiate or continue analysis and products immediately upon contract award.  Interested parties must also have expertise in developing, analyzing, and quantifying various concepts to form Families of Systems (FoS) that meet performance requirements consistent with the assessment approach currently utilized.  These FoS descriptions must include credible performance, cost, and schedule data to provide sufficient system trade spaces for decision-making.  Interested parties must also have knowledge of current and planned space control policies and their effects on FoS.  All interested parties must be cleared to handle government equipment and information up to, and including TS/SCI/SAR and have personnel with current TS/SSBIs as well as a Top Secret - SCI accredited SCIF.  SOCs should be sent to SYSW/PK, Attn: Capt Cliff Bermodes or e-mailed to clifford.bermodes@losangeles.af.mil and received by 4:00 P.M, PST, on 09 November 2007.  Submittals that contain classified materials must be coordinated with either the primary or secondary points of contact.  No contract award will be made on the basis of offers or proposals received in response to this notice.  The NAICS code for this announcement is 541310 with the applicable size standard of $4.5M.  Any business in this area of expertise will be allowed to participate in the submittal of SOCs.  Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.  However, all businesses must be capable to support operations pertaining to the description of services at the time of submitting SOCs.  

BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of white papers or the source selection process for this acquisition. The Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill, phone number (310) 653-1789.  Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be significant concerns and should be communicated directly to Capt Cliff Bermodes (See # 5 for contact information).

EXPEDITIONARY COMBAT SUPPORT BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA)
PURSUANT TO FAR 35.016 AND 6.102(d)(2)

PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.     THE 305th CONTRACTING SQUADRON, pursuant to this BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT, SOLICITS CONCEPT PAPERS IN SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AIR MOBILITY BATTLELAB.

A.  INTRODUCTION:  The United States Air Force (USAF) Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) is the Mobility Air Forces (MAF) catalyst for innovation across the spectrum of MAF missions and skills.  We capitalize on links with industry, laboratories, academia and MAF professionals, to advance the USAF distinctive capabilities of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.  Our primary focus is on identifying and investigating initiatives capable of being demonstrated in 18 months.  Through this BAA, AMB invites solution white papers with rough-order-of-magnitude cost and schedule estimates that address technological innovations and/or process improvements in the area of Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS).

This BAA is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraphs 35.016 and 6.102(d)(2) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.  Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."  Responses shall reference Solicitation Number.     THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS EFFECTIVE UNTIL 30 SEP 08, AND WHITE PAPERS MAY BE SUBMITTED AT ANY TIME UP TO THAT DATE.     AMB considers submissions by evaluation of a seven page white paper.  A copy of this BAA is also posted on the World Wide Web at http://public.mcguire.amc.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=4066.

B. OBJECTIVE:  AMB solicits innovative white papers addressing solutions to identified MAF needs utilizing existing or modified commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) items in the area of ECS.  White papers should contain proposals for using existing or modified COTS or GOTS items to reduce the overall deployment footprint, e.g., volume, weight, and/or size of the equipment needed to conduct and support MAF operations at deployed locations.  Footprint reduction should not come at the expense of durability, adequacy in capability and power, and usability in prolonged operations.    
ECS equipment should be simple in design and minimize the need for special tools.  Equipment configurations should avoid/minimize the need for any special support equipment beyond off-the-shelf assets.  All special equipment/tools required for assembly will be organic to ECS systems/components.  ECS systems /components must be air transportable.

ECS systems/components must be robust enough for diverse and harsh environments worldwide and operable in all climatic conditions.  Integrated ECS systems will provide the capability to support operations for an extended period.  ECS systems/components must withstand numerous and extended storage/deployment/use cycles.

ECS systems/components design must facilitate deployability, mission sizing, transportability, and storage.  Modularity for oversized or heavy items should be addressed and should not entail a large assembly burden on deploying forces.           

ECS systems must also be quick to: set up, become operational upon arrival at the deployed location, strike when the deployed capability is no longer required, and be designed for ease of reconstitution or disposal.

AMB prefers to use contractor-loaned equipment or to participate in Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), but does have limited funding for demonstrations.  Ultimately, the AMB conducts operational demonstrations of innovative mobility concepts, evaluates their military worth, and presents its assessments to senior decision makers including the Commander, US Air Force Expeditionary Center; Air Mobility Command Headquarters directorates and staff, Vice Commander, Air Mobility Command.  Submitters are encouraged to visit the AMB website at http://public.mcguire.amc.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=4066.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is responsible for administering two national disability programs, Title II Social Security Disability Insurance and Title XVI Supplemental Security Income.  On March 31, 2006, the SSA published a final rule in the Federal Register (Vo. 71, No. 62, March 31, 2006, pp. 16423-16462) amending the administrative review process for applications for benefits that are based on whether you are disabled under Title II of the Social Security Act (the Act) or applications for supplemental security income (SSI) payments that are based on whether you are disabled or blind under Title XVI of the Act.  To improve the accuracy, consistency, and timeliness of decision-making throughout the disability determination process, the final rule establishes SSA's new Disability Service Improvement (DSI) process.  


SSA has begun to roll out the new DSI process implemented on August 1, 2006 for applicants who reside in the states located in the Boston region (Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut, & Rhode Island).  Most disability claims are initially processed through a network of local Social Security field offices and State agencies (usually called disability determination services or DDSs). Until recently, subsequent appeals of unfavorable determinations were decided by the DDSs reconsiderations and subsequently by SSA Administrative Law Judges and the SSA Appeals Council.  As part of the new DSI process, claimants who are initially denied disability benefits by the DDS may appeal the denial to a Federal Reviewing Official (FedRO) and eventually to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). ALJ decisions will be reviewed by a Decision Review Board (DRB) before the individual can file an appeal with the federal court. 


During their review of the claim, either the FedRO or ALJ may decide that additional evidence is necessary in order to decide whether the individual is disabled.  Updated medical evidence from the claimant's own sources may be needed before a new decision can be made.  Additionally, the FedRO and/or ALJ may require that the individual undergo consultative examinations (CE) and/or tests in order to make a new decision on the claim.  


The final rules describing the new disability review process explain that SSA's Office of Medical and Vocational Expertise (OMVE) will arrange for CEs that are requested by FedROs and ALJs.  Therefore, SSA is seeking to contract with networks of physicians who can provide these CEs, tests and reports to SSA for applicants who reside in the Boston region and who are appealing their claims for disability. 


See SSA's DSI website for additional information on the new DSI process:  http://www.socialsecurity.gov/disability-new-approach/.  In addition, for information purposes ONLY, potential offerors are directed to SSA's Request for Information, reference number SSA-OAG-CE-Boston, entitled, "Consultative Examinations (Boston Region) Request for Information," posted to FedBizOpps on December 5, 2006 at:  http://www.fbo.gov/servlet/Solicitation/R/SSA/DCFIAM/OAG/Reference-Number-SSA-OAG-CE-Boston.  The RFI includes a DRAFT Statement of Work, DRAFT List of Exams and Background Information. 


SSA anticipates that this competition will result in the award of one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) with provisions for the issuance of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task orders.     The term of the BPA(s) will be for five years.         


This acquisition will be conducted in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.     This is an unrestricted requirement where proposals from all responsible sources will be considered by the Agency.  Any additional information and documents on this requirement will be posted to FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov).  Potential Offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps site for release of this solicitation, amendments and all other documents relative to this solicitation.  Requests for paper copies will not be honored.  Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR)  https://www.bpn.gov/CCR/scripts/index.html database prior to award of any contract or BPA.  SSA anticipates release of the solicitation (SSA-RFP-07-1022) within the week of January 8, 2007 with responses due within thirty (30) calendar days after date of issuance unless otherwise amended.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  All questions must be submitted in writing via e-mail to bridget.hamel@ssa.gov.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  E-mail communications shall include company name, address, point of contact, e-mail address, phone and fax numbers.


The Interested Vendors List (IVL) has been enabled for this solicitation.  Vendors are encouraged to register their interest in this solicitation.  Using the IVL will:     1) Provide interested parties with automatic notice of solicitation amendments; 2) Provide information to the Contract Specialist; and 3) Enable the Contract Specialist to publish a listing of the interested vendors through FedBizOpps to facilitate vendor collaboration for subcontracting opportunities, etc.  No other listing of interested vendors will be created or be available for release.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS. The United States Marine Corps, Marine Corps Systems Command, seeks a vendor to provide software engineering services in support of the General Service (GENSER) applications pertinent to the Technical Control and Analysis Center (TCAC) software baseline.   TCAC is the Senior Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) system in the Marine Corps and provides capabilities to the Operating Forces to analyze SIGINT and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) data, steerage and management of collection assets, production of SIGINT and ELINT products, and maintenance of data and voice communications connectivity to various assets at varying levels (including national, higher, adjacent, and intra Radio Battalion (RadBn)) within the intelligence community.   Recently, TCAC received direction to merge the capabilities provided by the Tactical Electronic Reconnaissance Processing and Evaluation System (TERPES) into the TCAC program of record.  In Fiscal Year 2008 TCAC will support the mission planning for airborne Electronic Warfare (EW) missions conducted by the Marine Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadrons (VMAQ) and provide Electronic Order of Battle (EOB) data to the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF).   This Request for Information (RFI) seeks all interested and capable vendors to perform software development and maintenance of the Tactical ELINT Pre-Processor (TEPP) segment and the Parametric Electronic Order of Battle (PEOB) database.  The TEPP application reads, decodes and processes EA-6B recorded mission data and provides Marine analysts with tools for evaluating the results and reporting derived intelligence.  In direct support of the TEPP application are the Mission Download Tools, which retrieve the recorded mission data from the aircraft media and store it in files that TEPP can read and process.   The PEOB database manages and stores parametric observations from the EA-6B aircraft and other overhead collectors and provides Marine analysts with supplemental information for individually identified radar equipment for areas of interest around the world.  The PEOB database is intended as a supplement to national reference databases such as Modernized Integrated Data Base (MIDB) and ELINT Parameters List (EPL), by providing observed parametric information that can be used for signal identification, mission planning and situational awareness.   Qualified vendors must be capable of providing personnel with expert knowledge of USMC ELINT operations, eligible for DoD Secret clearance.  The work shall be performed at the vendors facility and must accommodate a software development environment capable of processing Secret information and accessing Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet).  Deliverables associated with this effort include: quarterly software releases with associated documentation and test event participation; configuration management of the TEPP and PEOB segments; training support; Information Assurance Vulnerability Alert (IAVA) tracking and reporting; and post deployment software support to assist with troubleshooting and helpdesk inquiries.   The yearly value of the effort is estimated at $2,000,000.00.  Vendors capable of providing the required services, in whole and within the estimated value, are invited to submit a response to this notice.   Vendors should include literature, brochures, price lists and capabilities summaries limited to 20 pages directly addressing their ability to meet the aforementioned needs.  Interested vendors shall respond NLT 21 November 2007, stating their business size, NAICS Code and identifying a corporate point of contact.  Interested sources should respond to: (U.S. Mail address) Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command, ATTN Vanessa Coleman (TCAC GENSER SW RFI), 2200 Lester Street, Quantico VA 22134.   THE SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
Dual Digital Autopilot System for KC-135R/T and Special Purpose Aircraft

PURPOSE
The 827th ACSG Contracting Office, Tinker AFB, OK, is conducting market research to determine estimated cost, schedule, and performance parameters to remove the existing Autopilot System (ASW-48) and install a replacement Dual Digital Autopilot System and associated components (hardware, software, etc).

DESCRIPTION
The KC-135R/T and Special Purpose aircraft Autopilot system generates low reliability and an undesired number of disconnects during refueling operations.  A proposed replacement autopilot system should use Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) and Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) equipment to the maximum extent possible.  The modified aircraft must meet current and future FAA and ICAO requirements including, but not limited to:  Worldwide capability and certification for extended over-the-water operations; enable Required Navigation Performance (RNP) of 0.15 (total system accuracy of 0.15 nautical miles 95% of the flying time) in terminal areas (meeting performance/certification of RNP 0.15 may require additional systems modifications at a future time); and meet Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) requirements and emerging Communications, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.

The proposed dual digital autopilot must address the following capabilities:

- Continual crosschecking 
- Vertical navigation (e.g. provide the ability to bring the aircraft to approach from cruise altitude) while providing airspeed or throttle queues to the aircrew for airspeed deviation through annunciation (there are no auto-throttles on the KC-135)
- Replacement of the Angle of Attack (AoA) transmitters and indicator providing digital inputs to the autopilot and flight director systems
- Autopilot system should receive and provide digital outputs to all associated systems with the exception of those requiring servo, synchro, or other analog signal inputs
- When installed, the system will be able to accept aircrew-selectable air refueling receiver type profiles to allow autopilot to compensate for incoming receiver aircraft, reducing the number of un-commanded autopilot disconnects
- Ability to store and provide any detected faults and provide maintenance crews with fault verbiage
- Dual autopilot control heads with capability to integrate autopilot and flight director functions together (desire)
- Provide dual control surface sensing at the control surfaces (tail)
- Autopilot system Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) protection
- Potentially perform yaw control


NOTE:  Must maintain software interoperability with the existing avionics systems components and software configuration to ensure the ability to interface with existing systems w/o degrading current capability.

RESPONSE
Responses shall address:
1.	Performance parameters, to include design, installation, reliability, maintainability data, and testing.
2.	Program Estimated Cost information (rough order of magnitude)
3.	Delivery schedule/product availability
4.	Any alternatives/suggestions that satisfy airworthiness requirements, to include cost and schedule

Interested firms should also include the following in their response:

-Company Name and Address
-CAGE Code (if available)
-Point of Contact
-Size of Business (i.e. Large/small business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a) concern, Minority-owned business)
-U.S. or Foreign Owned Entity

Submit response (along with any supporting documentation) directly to:

	- Provide a backup capability to display numerical engine data readouts in the event of display failure
	- Allow software to be loaded for the display and data concentrator in the field
	- System should store and provide faults, and provide maintenance crews with fault verbiage
	- Data concentrator will be installed in lower nose with possible standard 1553 data bus lines running from data collector to display units (EMP requirements)
	- System Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) protection, and nuclear hardened display
	- The Data Concentrator must be able to collect and provide for display, the following information:

The QIO program is currently operating under the 8th Scope of Work (SoW) (August 1, 2005 through July 31, 2008).  The 8th SoW contract is to assist providers, nursing homes, home health agencies, hospitals, and physician practice sites, in measuring and reporting quality, producing and using electronic clinical information, redesigning care processes, and transforming organizational cultures so as to accelerate the rate of quality improvement and broaden its impact thereby increasing the value offered to beneficiaries through traditional Medicare, Medicare Advantage, and Part D benefits.  

The QIO Program's 9th SoW, begins on August 1, 2008, will focus on proposed Themes in the areas of Prevention, Patient Safety, Patient Pathways/Care Coordination and Beneficiary Protection.  The 9th SoW aims to improve quality of care and provide protection for all Medicare beneficiaries.  In addition to a focus on these cross-setting Themes, the 9th SOW will have an overarching focus throughout all Themes on Value-Driven Healthcare, Adoption and Use of Health Information Technology, and Reduction of Health Disparities. Both of the Themes and cross-thematic topics will address the major healthcare priorities that the Department of Health and Human Services' Secretary Michael Leavitt has identified for the Nation's healthcare system.    

CMS is inviting organizations interested in becoming QIOs to attend the Conference.  In order to be eligible for a QIO contract an organization must either be a physician-sponsored or a physician-access organization as described in Section 462.102 and Section 462.103 of the Code of Federal  Regulations (CFR), and demonstrate its ability to perform review as set forth in Section 462.104 of the CFR.  Stakeholders/external partners are critical to the success of the QIO program and we welcome your attendance at this year's conference.

Answer: Yes - As per the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) pg 2 para 2.4 Type IIIA (High Velocity 9 mm; 44 Magnum) This armor protects against 9 mm Full Metal Jacketed Round Nose (FMJ RN) bullets, with nominal masses of 8.0 g (124 gr) impacting at a minimum velocity of 427 m/s (1400 ft/s) or less, and 44 Magnum Semi Jacketed Hollow Point (SJHP) bullets, with nominal masses of 15.6 g (240 gr) impacting at a minimum velocity of 427 m/s (1400 ft/s) or less. It also provides protection against most handgun threats, as well as the threats mentioned in sections 2.1, 2.2 

Question #2 - Required protection is listed as 3A. Is NIJ certification required? If so, to which NIJ standard? If not, what QTY of test results are desired? 

Answer: Yes. The standard is - 0101.04. Please see the complete NIJ standard on the ARSC website which is accessible at http://www.uscg.mil/hq/arsc/contracting/HH65/HH-65.htm. Question 


Question #3 - Is the customer expecting a flexible solution (Kevlar blanket), or a semi rigid lightweight solution made from HPPE fiber? 

Answer: A flexible blanket has been discussed as the goal, meeting the required level of protection while also keeping the weight down to a minimum of 1.5 lbs per sq/ft. We would entertain any solution meeting this requirement.

<DESC>SUBJECT SOLICITATION IS HEREBY REOPENED TO CLARIFY THE EVALUATION FACTORS IAW FAR 52.212-2.  

52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)


The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:


1.	Past Performance
2.	Price

Past performance is slightly more important than price.

Note:  Technical Acceptability is hereby removed as an evaluation factor


(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(End of clause)


EVALUATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE


Past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror to successfully meet the requirements of the Request for Quotation.  Past performance will be evaluated in light of the relevant contract work performed to a high degree of quality.  Past performance is slightly more important than price.  Offerors are required to provide past performance experience information for the same or similar rental services as those described in the RFQ.  Offerors shall be required to provide the requested information for not more than three (3) of the firm's most recently completed Federal Government, State Government, Municipal Government or commercial contracts which have been completed within the past five (5) years from the issuance date of the solicitation identified in this Source Selection Plan.


Offerors may submit performance data relating to current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of the subject solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts/orders should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the applicable contract/order to the requirements set forth in the solicitation.

?Relevance? is defined as the similarity of services provided and the dollar value of previous contracts or purchase orders to the items stated in the Government?s Request for Quotation.  "Completed", for the purposes of past performance evaluation, shall mean the receipt of a DD250, final payment or other evidence of final acceptance by the Government of the services provided by the Contractor.

The offerors should provide the following information regarding past performance:

	a)  Contract or purchase order number(s),
	b)  Name and phone number of contact at the Federal, State, Local Government or
	      commercial entity for which the contract was performed.
	c)  E-mail address (if available) for point of contact
	d)  Dollar value of contact
	e)  Detailed description of the service and unit prices
	f)   Names of subcontractors, if any, and a description of services provided
	g)  The number, type and severity of any quality, delivery or cost problems in the
	      performance of the contract, the corrective action taken, and the effectiveness 
	      of the corrective action

Offerors lacking relevant past performance history or for whom past performance information is not available, shall receive a neutral rating for past performance.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quotation to the Government. 


The Government reserves the right to acquire information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any source including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephone and/or written inquiry.  This information may include reviewing the Contractors Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS), Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), or past performance information from any source whatsoever.  Written inquiries/correspondence and telephone interviews will be posted in the contract file.

Although the PCO will seek to engage in an even-handed and fair evaluation process, the PCO is not obligated to engage in ?equal? comparison of past performance of all offerors.  For example, if two more instances of past performance data are available for one contractor, the PCO is not then required to search for past performance of two additional contracts for every offeror.


The PCO will evaluate the offeror?s Past Performance using the following equally important sub-factors:

(a)  Quality:  The offeror?s demonstrated history of delivering products and services, the same as or similar to the item described in the Request for Quotation, that met or exceeded the requirements of the contract.  Quality will be evaluated in terms of:

	(1)  Customer satisfaction,
	(2)  Instances of rework or deficiency reports,
	(3)  Evidence of effective and/or innovative work applications of benefit to the
	      customer.


(b)  Timeliness:  The offeror?s compliance with:

	(1)  delivery/performance schedules,
	(2)  Timeliness of submission of requested information, reports and invoicing

(c)  Contractor Responsiveness:  The offeror?s demonstrated ability to:

	(1)  Respond to customer concerns,
	(2)  Isolate and resolve problems,
	(3)  Take systemic improvement action.

Each performance risk assessment of the factors listed above will consider

	(1)  The number and severity of problems,
	(2) The effectiveness of the corrective action taken,
	(3) The overall work record.

The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror?s performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the Government after consideration of all available, relevant and recent information.  Therefore, the adjectival rating generally correlate with the definitions of performance risk as follows:


Outstanding (O): Truly exceptional accomplishment of contract requirements and extraordinary customer satisfaction.  Extremely Low Performance Risk.  Based on the offeror's performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will very successfully perform the required effort.  This equates to a rating of ?O? in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).

Highly Acceptable (HA): Past Performance: Superior accomplishment of contract requirements and very high customer satisfaction.  Very Low Performance Risk.  Based on the offeror's performance record, very little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  This equates to a rating of ?HA? in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).

Acceptable (A): Past Performance: Fully compliant accomplishment of contract requirements and positive customer satisfaction.  Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, minimal (but perhaps some) doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  This equates to a rating of ?A? in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).


Marginal (M): Past Performance: Minimal or weak accomplishment of contract requirements and low level of customer satisfaction.  High Performance Risk.  Based on the offeror's performance record, significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  This equates to a rating of ?M? in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).


Unacceptable (U): Past Performance: Failure to properly accomplish contract requirements and failure to satisfy customer.  Very High Performance Risk.  
Based on the offeror's performance record, it appears unlikely that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  This equates to a rating of ?U? in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).


.  	Neutral (N):  Past Performance:  No relevant past performance history or past 	performance information is available.  Unknown performance risk assessment.


THE TIME AND DATE FOR RECEIPT OF OFFERS UNDER THIS  SOLICITATION IS HEREBY RE-ESTABLISHED AS FRIDAY, OCTOBER 12, 2007 @ 12:00 PM (NOON ? LOCAL TIME)
