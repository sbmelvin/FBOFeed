<DESC><p><strong><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; color: #000000; font-family: Verdana;">The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) is seeking qualified firms or organizations to provide project management oversight (PMO) support services for select capital projects under an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract.&nbsp; FTA defines oversight as a continuous review and evaluation of grantee and FTA processes to ensure compliance with statutory, administrative, and regulatory requirements.&nbsp; The Office of Engineering, through the Regional Offices, performs oversight of grantee project management that focuses on the management of major investments (New Starts, rail modernization, etc.) in transit projects.&nbsp; This activity begins early in project implementation, usually at the time of preliminary engineering.&nbsp; PMO contractors monitor the large caseload of projects, following guidelines established by FTA.&nbsp;&nbsp;PMO contractors&nbsp;serve to supplement the FTA technical staff to evaluate grantee project management and technical capacity and capability to successfully implement these major transit projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;PMO contractors&nbsp;also monitor the projects to determine whether the projects&nbsp;are progressing on time, within budget, and in accordance with approved grantee plans and specifications.&nbsp; Other activities are also involved, such as design constructability, change order reviews, and value engineering submittals.&nbsp; The projects to be monitored vary in size from $25,000,000 to over $10,000,000,000.&nbsp; This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.&nbsp; The Government may elect to award up to 20 indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts under this solicitation.&nbsp; FTA anticipates awarding five (5) contracts to Small Business concerns.&nbsp; The contract period is five (5)&nbsp;years from date of award.&nbsp;&nbsp;All offerors shall submit a proposal based upon a level of effort of 60,000 direct labor hours, inclusive of&nbsp;any overtime,&nbsp;for the 5-year period of performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Work under this contract will be assigned subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders.&nbsp;&nbsp; The duration and level of effort for each task order will vary according to the size and status of each monitored project.&nbsp; The contract ceiling shall be a maximum not to exceed of 300,000 direct labor hours over the 5-year period of performance.&nbsp; Individual tasks orders may be written for a maximum of $15 million.&nbsp; FTA will provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, with consideration of any potential conflicts of interest or past performance issues.&nbsp; A goal of 20 percent has been established for this procurement for participation by or subcontracting to women-owned businesses, 8(a), HubZone, small business concerns and/or small disadvantaged, disadvantaged&nbsp;veteran-owned&nbsp;businesses.&nbsp; If a large business is selected for contract award, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract.&nbsp; The subcontracting goal of 20 percent&nbsp;applies to the total cost of the contract.</span></strong></p>

<SUBJECT>Pharmacogenetic Testing on Drug Efficacy
<SOLNBR>FDA-SOL-08-00668a
<RESPDATE>061108
<CONTACT>David - Kordel, Fax 301-827-7151, Email david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>FDA-SOL-08-00668a
<p>
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking Full and Open Competition for vendors to write an analytical report on Pharmacogenetic Testing on Drug Efficacy. <p>

Background: The notion that drugs do not have the same effects in every patient is well spread among healthcare professionals. For decades physicians have used characteristics such us age, weight and sex to select the right treatment for their patients. This approach, though very useful in the clinical practice, seems to have reached its limit.  There are still a large number of patients that do not respond to standard treatments or suffer from adverse effects. In recent years, advances in genomic research offered new possibilities toward the individualization of drug therapies. One good example is the application of genomics to the use of warfarin. The important variability in the response to warfarin is explained in part by genetic variants in the warfarin target, an enzyme called VKORC1, as well as the enzyme that clears warfarin from the body (CYP2C9). Patients with certain VKORC1 genetic variants are warfarin sensitive and require low warfarin doses. Likewise, patients with certain CYP2C9 genetic variants eliminate warfarin slowly and are more likely to have serious bleeding events when administered standard doses of warfarin. Pharmacogenetic testing, along with other characteristics of the patient, can provide an estimate of the therapeutic warfarin dose, improving the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulant therapy. Diagnostic tests to identify these and many other genetic variants relevant to the prescription of drugs are commercially available. However, the integration of genetic information to guide drug prescription is still limited. One of the reasons for such limitation is the scarcity of data supporting the clinical utility and the practical application of pharmacogenetic testing. The collection of that kind of data for each pharmacogenetic test and each drug by performing traditional clinical studies can be very costly and as such unlikely to occur. Therefore, it is important to identify other resources that can assist us in obtaining the necessary information to facilitate the use of genomics in the clinical practice. Pharmacy benefit providers collect and organize clinical and prescription data from their users. Many of these providers have also encouraged physicians to use certain pharmacogenetic tests as a guide to their prescription decisions and have developed the infrastructure to allow the prescription of the tests and the delivery of the results in a timely manner within their system, assuring the test results can be used effectively. The significant amount of data these providers collect and their experience in implementing pharmacogenetic testing make them a valuable resource to evaluate the utility of using genomics to aid drug prescribing.<p>

A.  Key Objectives<P>

1) Identify drugs whose effectiveness and/or safety profiles can be improved by utilizing genetic information to guide prescription: Many drugs pose challenges in selecting the right dose or the patients that may benefit from them. However, pharmacogenetic tests are not available for all of these drugs. FDA aims at identifying the drug-test pairs that could be effectively applied to guide prescription.<P>
2) Identify available pharmacogenetic tests that can be effectively performed and utilized using a prescription-driven program: Some technical characteristics of the test can limit the application of pharmacogenetic testing to the patient care (e.g. by requiring sophisticated methods to obtain the sample or taking several days to deliver results).<P>
3) Quantify the prescription of these drugs among users of the selected pharmacy benefits provider: For most drugs, the utility of pharmacogenetic testing in the clinical practice is related to the number of patients that are prescribed the drug and, therefore, would benefit from the new approach.<P>
4) Identify prescription patterns among users of the selected pharmacy benefits provider: In addition to the number of patients that could potentially benefit from genetic-guided drug prescriptions, the characteristics of the patients that receive the drug (e.g. age, weight, race, etc.), the disease being treated, other drugs these patients receive, etc. are important factors affecting the utility of pharmacogenetic testing.<P>
5) Evaluate the utility of pharmacogenetic testing in the clinical setting: Pharmacogenetic testing has the potential to increase the number of correct prescriptions for the selected drugs (the right drug at the right dose). <P>
6) Evaluate the effect of pharmacogenetic testing on the effectiveness and safety of the selected drugs in the clinical setting: By guiding prescribers in selecting the right drug at the right dose, pharmacogenetic testing can improve clinical outcome by increasing the rate of treatment response and decreasing the rate of treatment failure and the number and severity of adverse events.<P>
7) Evaluate the ability of a prescription-driven feedback program to facilitate the utilization of pharmacogenetic tests in the clinical practice: It is necessary to identify effective ways to inform prescribers and patients about the test and its results, to make and implement the decisions based on the test results.<P>

C. Scope of Work <P>

This project shall be a collaborative effort of the FDA with a Pharmacy Benefit Provider (PBP).  PBP shall have access to a large patient database, which will allow us to measure the impact of pharmacogenetic testing. Upon selecting the drug-test pairs to be included in the study, FDA shall investigate the collaborator’s database to identify two cohorts of patients: those receiving the standard therapy and those receiving the pharmacogenetic-aided treatment.  Effectiveness and/or safety of the selected drugs will be compared between the two cohorts.  The metrics for evaluating impact on effectiveness/safety will be specific to each drug/pharmacogenetic test included in the study. Examples of these metrics are:
• Dose adjustment
• Treatment discontinuation or treatment substitution
• Number/ length of hospitalization 
• Emergency room visits
• Adverse events: bleeding events, sedation, vomiting, headache, insomnia, tremor, weight loss<P>

Phase 1: A pilot study with warfarin shall be conducted to measure the impact of genetic testing for CYP2C9 and VKORC1.  This will provide a solid case study and will serve to establish the process (standard operating procedures or SOP). Duration: 6 months. 
Phase 2: Project expansion – following the SOP developed in phase 1, a list of other drug-test pairs, e.g. CYP2D6 and atomoxetine or selected opioids (codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, tramadol) shall be explored. Duration: 18 months.<P>

This project will be completed in two years. All results will be published in peer-reviewed literature.<P>
 
D.  Key Tasks <P>
1)Access to database containing rich and quality data from users on:
• Drugs prescription, dose, dose adjustments and discontinuation of treatment 
• Moderate and severe adverse events to treatment, number of doctor’s office visits and number of hospitalizations with the corresponding length of stay and cause in the period of drug prescription
• Time data to allow analysis of temporal relationship of all the above mentioned parameters<P>
2) Access, experience and infrastructure to facilitate pharmacogenetic testing and appropriately organize and store the test results<P>
3) Access to database containing rich and quality data from at least 1000 patients on:
• Warfarin prescription, dose, dose adjustments and number of INR tests for at least 6 months 
• CYP2C9 and VKORC1 test results or capability to facilitate testing and appropriately organize and store test results
• Bleeding events, number of doctor’s office visits and number of hospitalizations with the corresponding length of stay and cause in the period of warfarin prescription
• Time data to allow analysis of temporal relationship of all the above mentioned parameters<P>
4) Delivery of:
• Weekly oral reports and monthly meetings on the progress of the project 
• Quarterly written progress reports (electronic version)
• Draft of final report for FDA review due 60 days before the completion of the project.
• Electronic versions of all presentations, reports, methodologies, and models in formats compatible with IBM PC Systems, preferably Microsoft Office
The weekly and monthly meetings will be used to monitor the progress of the project and to make adjustments to the plan as needed. The quarterly written reports will be evaluated, edited and kept for our records. 
• The final report shall be a joint effort between the contractor and the FDA. <P>
5) Optional: A minimum of one of the PBP staff member who is knowledgeable about the use of the software and the organization of the data within the database to work directly in the project. This staff member shall dedicate significant amount of his/her time to the project and shall be readily available to address our questions, comments and needs on the project.
6) Optional: Publishing the results in peer-reviewed literature <P>

E. Deliverables <P>
Please note that the deliverables listed below are sequential and may overlap as the study progresses.  These are also one-time deliverables.<P>

1) List of drugs whose effectiveness and/or safety profiles can be improved by utilizing genetic information to guide prescription. Timeline: 3 months. <P>
2) List of available pharmacogenetic tests that can be effectively performed and utilized using a prescription-driven program. Timeline: 3 months.<P>
3) Written report on selected drugs utilization among users of the selected pharmacy benefits provider. Timeline: 6 months.<P>
4) Written report on prescription patterns among users of the selected pharmacy benefits provider. Timeline: 6 months.<P>
5) Written report on the effect of pharmacogenetic testing on the effectiveness and safety of warfarin in the clinical setting.  Timeline: 8 months.<P>

Return to base repair contract.6- Qty.1 SimSUPPORT - MS3019 - 12 months Maintenance and support on your STR4500 GPSSimulator system; SN 1095.  Return to base repair contract.Specs for above items are as follows:1.  Maintenance and technical support of the NASA/Goddard Global Position System (GPS)Test Facility Simulators for a period that begins on August 1, 2008 and ends twelvemonths thereafter.  This contract will cover two STR4760 simulators and the GSS7750-L5,located at GSFC, the STR4760 Simulator system located at Wallops Flight Facility, and theSTR4500 portable simulators at GSFC and WFF, whose maintenance agreements are due toexpire on July 31, 2008.     2.   Provide intelligent technical support services to the GPS Simulator operations andinsure minimum down time in 2008/2009 of these valuable Goddard resources.  Thismaintenance contract will also cover the upgrade of one of the simulator systems toenable GSFC engineers to perform GPS testing with the latest frequencies used by the GPSconstellation of satellites.3.  The GPS Navigation and Attitude Simulators are an integral component for the ongoingFormation Flying Test Bed (FFTB) and the Distributed Simulation Environment (DSE)activities here at GSFC.   The simulators have been, and continue to be utilized tosupport numerous space-flight and terrestrial projects with minimal down time due tomaintenance issues.  The STR4500 system is being used for GPS software development inGSFCs in-house receiver development activities.  The STR4760 and the STR 4500 systems atWallops enables WFF engineers to perform GPS tests on-site for Sounding Rocket flightsprior to integration and launch.4  The GPS Simulators maintenance contract is an annually renewable contract, underwhich Spirent Federal supplies any necessary proprietary software upgrades for theoperation of the systems.  Spirent Federal also maintains a technical help hotline whichGSFC engineers regularly avail themselves of, and if necessary, Spirent Federal eithersupplies replacement parts and/or performs actual hardware maintenance on the systemseither at GSFC or at their home site.  5.  The Goddard GPS Simulators, STR4760, for navigation and attitude,  7750-L5 andSTR4500 for remote site testing, were manufactured by Spirent Federal Systems,specifically to satisfy Goddard requirements, and are dedicated systems that provideGoddard with capabilities unique to the spacecraft design industry.  Spirent Federalholds patents and copyrights on their hardware and source code.  These are proprietary,and not available to NASA.  Spirent Federal Systems is thus the only qualified source tocurrently provide technical maintenance for the Goddard 64-channel on-orbit position,attitude and time GPS Simulator STR4760 as well as the STR4500 transportable GPSsimulator.6.  NASA, in general, sponsors programs to give widest possible competitive access toindustry.

<DESC><p>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), Office of Hydrologic Development (OHD)&nbsp;intends to solicit on a non-competitive basis with Deltares, Delft, of the Netherlands to purchase specialty software engineering and consulting services&nbsp;to implement NOAA's Community Hydrologic Prediction System (CHPS).&nbsp; Delft developed a CHPS Pilot system based on their Delft-Flood Early Warning System (FEWS) under a previous contract.&nbsp; Using Delft-FEWS infrastructure, the NWS River Forecast System (NWSRFS) architecture is expected to evolve from operating as a single procedural application to running as a more modular suite of components, the Community Hydrologic Prediction System (CHPS). This CHPS FEWS Pilot is now installed at four (4) NWS River Forecast Centers (RFCs): Arkansas-Red Basin (ABRFC, Tulsa, Oklahoma), California-Nevada (CNRFC, Davis, California), North Central (NCRFC, Chanhassen, Minnesota), and Northwest (NWRFC, Portland, Oregon). With this work, the OHD will develop an operational CHPS based on the Delft-FEWS infrastructure which leverages the CHPS FEWS Pilot. The work goal is to provide all thirteen (13) RFCs an operational implementation of CHPS and to help them complete a successful migration away from the NWSRFS to CHPS. Preliminary analyses conducted to date have revealed the need to make some NWS-specific enhancements to the Delft-FEWS system itself. Additional analyses will be required to determine how to modernize current hydrologic model calibration and ensembles capabilities. From the perspective of a full end-to-end river forecasting process the project would additionally entail an analysis of locally-developed software applications (referred to as "local applications") to determine which, if any, could and should be incorporated into CHPS. Local applications have been written by RFC personnel who possess software programming skills, and who have developed computer programs for specific local use.

<SUBJECT>Applanix Position Orientation System Upgrades and IMUs
<SOLNBR>EA133M-8-RQ-0598

<CONTACT>Melissa R Sampson, Contracting Officer, Phone 757-441-6561, Fax 757-441-3786, Email melissa.r.sampson@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>This notice services to fulfill the requirements of FAR 8.402(f)(1), 5.203(a) and 8.405-6(d)(2). The need to post the below open market items in accordance with (IAW) 8.402(f) on FedBizOpps is therein necessitating the posting required at 8.405-6(d) here, on FedBizOpps, in lieu of http://www.ebuy.gsa.gov.
<p>It is the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s intent to award a delivery order to Applanix, LLC utilizing FAR 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules for up to ten (10) Position &amp; Orientation upgrades (from Version 3 to Version 4) and two (2) open market Inertial Measurement Units. The following justification (redacted as necessary) is provided to fulfill the FAR requirements cited above:</p>
<p>Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity: <br />This is issued by the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD), Atmospheric Branch, for the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO), Norfolk, VA in accordance with FAR Part 8.405-6.<br />Nature and Description of Action: <br />This justification covers purchases from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of Position &amp; Orientation System (POS) upgrades from Version 3 (V3) to Version 4 (V4). The POS OEM is Applanix, LLC and their POSs are installed on all NOAA Hydrographic vessels and launches within OMAO and the Office of Coast Survey. This justification covers upgrades for four (4) OMAO ships [RAINER, OSCAR DYSON, KA'IMIMOANA and MILLER FREEMAN] and four (4) each fleet spares. In addition a total of two (2) each Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) are required to replace one currently damaged on the RAINER and to replace one taken from the RUDE for use on the THOMAS JEFFERSON. These purchases will be made from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Applanix, LLC utilizing FAR 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules. However because only one of the two required items [the upgrades] are available on the Applanix LLC, Federal Supply Schedule, a synopsis in accordance with FAR Part 8.402(f) will be issued for fifteen days prior to initiating a contract action to Applanix, LLC for the open market item and in so doing, the synopsis will essentially meet, if not exceed, the intent of the requirements at 8.405-6(e). Should the results be contrary to that documented here, the procurement strategy will be evaluated.<br />Description of Supplies or Services:</p>
<p>This justification covers the purchase of POS-MV upgrades, from V3 to V4 with RTK (Real Time Kinematic) and the purchase of IMU's. The POS-MV is a tightly-coupled system using Applanix' proprietary and unique approach to Inertially-Aided Real-Time Kinematic (IARTK) technology. The POS-MV V4 upgrade enables continuous positioning information to be generated while surveying in areas where GPS reception is compromised by the effects of multipath and satellite signal loss. Raw GPS data from as few as one satellite can be processed directly within the POS-MV to reduce position drift and RTK reacquisition time. This characteristic strengthens the system's ability to generate continuous, accurate data irrespective of its proximity to port, harbor, and offshore structures. The advantages to be gained by the V4 upgrade include faster and more robust heading aiding from the GPS Azimuth Measurement Subsystem (GAMS), improved heading accuracy when operating in a high multipath environment and in areas of poor GPS availability, superior low-elevation satellite tracking performance regardless of latitude, faster initial system calibration, automatic identification and error estimation for lever arm distances and angles, and the latest GPS technology from Trimble - the BD950 Compact Card receiver together with Zephyr<sup>TM</sup> geodetic antennas to provide the following: Fast response time and very low noise L1 and L2 carrier phase measurements, Enhanced tracking capability using the Maxwell 4 Custom Survey GPS chip and increased component reliability.</p>
<p>The V3 to V4 upgrade replaces the complete PCS, which is the "top side" computer system. The PCS consists of thousands of individual electronic components, which comprise the power supplies, wiring bundles, GPS receivers, back planes, circuit boards, etc. The POS MV consists of three distinct assemblies; the PCS, the IMU, and the Antennas. The system will not function without each of these individual assemblies in place.</p>
<p>The two each IMU components are needed to replace failed units and are not part of the V3 to V4 upgrade. Without fully functioning IMUs the system's primary sensor, the IMU, would not allow for the continuous output of the position and orientation data. Such lose of output means that the multibeam echo soundings will not register as motion compensation data; thus, will not eliminate the affects of vessel movement, and will not provide accurate information/data. As a most basic explanation, the IMU supplies the vessels dynamics to the PCS which blends these motions with its internal GPS, through a set of navigation algorithms and combines this with a Kahlman filter, to derive the vessels Heave, Roll, Pitch, Heading and Position. The POS MV (regardless of version) is completely useless with a failed IMU.</p>
<p>A firm fixed Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is contemplated for 36 months with a minimum of two and a maximum of ten upgrades and IMOs. The guaranteed minimum will be for two upgrades (Rainer and Dyson) and two IMUs (Rainer and Thomas Jefferson), having an overall estimated value of $XXX,XXX.XX to include shipping. Additional quantities up to the maximum may be ordered for a total of 36 months.<br /><br />Identification of Statutory Authority: FAR 8.405-6(b)(2), Limited Sources Justification and Approval.</p>
<p>Demonstration that the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited and Discussion of Selected Contractor Qualifications: <br />It is currently not in the Government's best interest to replace all existing POS-MV systems with new systems competitively on the open market for two reasons. One reason is that the Government can obtain the latest technology advancements simply by upgrading to a V4 from a V3 and can do it at a quarter of the cost of buying either a new system from Applanix, LLC or a competitors system that is similar in technological advancement. The second reason is that no other system offers advancements that are of same or superior benefit that aren't already available in the V4 at the price of an upgrade versus complete system replacement. Essentially when upgrading to a V4, the PCS of the V3 is removed and exchanged for the PCS of a V4, which essentially gives the Government a "like new" system at a price of approximately $XX,XXX.XX less per radar over replacing the systems with new systems on the competitive open market.</p>
<p>Applanix is a leader in the advancement of technology at it relates to products and solutions for mapping and positioning from mobile platforms. The Applanix POS is proprietary, as are the system upgrades and are not available from any other source. Eventually Applanix, LLC will no longer support prior versions, specifically the version 3's on the above named ships. Many of the Hydrographic vessels within NOAA already have the V4 and so it is in the best interest of the Government to capitalize on standardization among the fleet as well as on the technological advances which make the system uniquely suited to the mission requirements of precision marine motion sensing, hydrographic surveying and charting. <br />Determination of Fair and Reasonable Prices by the Contracting Officer: <br />The upgrades are available via GSA, as such; the price has already been determined to be fair and reasonable. With regard to the two IMUs, they are not available on Schedule; however, Applanix has provided a published price list wherein the prices are offered to all customers.</p>
<p>Market Research: <br />Market research was conducted using the resources of the Internet. Market research reveals that similar technology exists on the commercial market; however it is not in the best interest of the Government to replace existing systems with new for the reasons stated above. Each time an upgrade is put out on the market from Applanix the NOAA's Office of Ocean Survey, evaluates the market to ensure that technology hasn't changed as to offer something of benefit that would warrant a complete system re-procurement versus a cost-effective system upgrade.<br />END OF JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency within fifteen days of the posting of this notice. Submit to Melissa R. Sampson via e-mail at melissa.r.sampson@noaa.gov. Questions may be referred to Ms. Sampson at 757-441-6561.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), conducts research on marine mammals important to the mission of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and NOAA, with particular attention to issues related to marine mammals off the coasts of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California.
The North Pacific right whale Eubalaena Japonica was severely depleted by whaling in the past two centuries.  The current size of the eastern population is estimated at fewer than 100 individuals and this stock is considered critically endangered; its current distribution is known only from records in a relatively limited area of the southeastern Bering Sea, and from a few occurrences in the Gulf of Alaska.  Historical catch and sighting data indicate that right whales were abundant and widely distributed in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska in summer and early autumn.

The NMML has a requirement for the performance of aerial surveys to determine distribution and abundance of cetaceans within the North Aleutian Basin.  The aerial surveys shall take place in the North Aleutian Basin in the Bering Sea during the months of July and August 2008 and 2009, focusing on the regions currently designated as Right Whale critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act, and proposed oil and gas sale lease areas in the Southeastern Bering Sea.  The Government will provide the survey aircraft.  Reconnaissance flights and line transect surveys will be flown to determine, through observation, the distribution and abundance of North Pacific Right Whales and other cetaceans within the North Aleutian Basin.  When encountered, Right Whales and other large cetaceans shall be photographed.  The aerial surveys will require an experienced scientific team comprised of a Project Coordinator/Principle Investigator, Field Project Leader and three Observers. The Principle Investigator must demonstrate knowledge of aerial survey methodology.  The Principle Investigator and Field Project Leader shall plan and coordinate the aerial surveys in consultation with NMML to determine the survey effort area.  Observers shall have experience photographing and identifying marine mammals from aircraft, and be familiar with computer software used to collect sightings, survey conditions, and position data.  The vendor shall compile the survey data, photographic images, and provide final field reports and raw data (including photographic images) to NMML within two months of the end of the survey for each survey period.  Deliverables will include electronic files containing all raw data including photographic images, a report summarizing all survey effort, sightings, and environmental conditions.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy has a requirement for all program management, engineering, test services, logistics, and maintenance necessary to support the design, development, integration and testing of the JCREW System of Systems [SoS]. The JCREW SoS approach includes three distinct capabilities that shall utilize common component, software and hardware solutions for an open, flexible, and compatible system design approach that is modular, interoperable and affordable to upgrade.  The three capabilities are: mobile dismounted operations (e.g. manpack), mobile ground and waterborne transport and combat systems (e.g. mounted), and semi-permanent geographical area (e.g. fixed) devices.  The JCREW SoS will be employed throughout the future operating environment, supporting US forces dominance over the electromagnetic spectrum, and will not require new or unique communications systems, but will operate within the bandwidth and quality of service of current and future systems. The requirement includes all materials, equipment, tooling, personnel and facilities necessary to design, fabricate, integrate, and test the types and quantities of deliverables specified.  The requirement will support system development and demonstration phases through Preliminary Design Review [PDR] with options to continue design through Critical Design Review [CDR] and fabrication of one Performance Specification Verification Model (PSVM). The requirement will contain options to continue development past CDR for the fabrication of up to 25 Engineering Development Models [EDMs] for each capability.  The effort includes Long Lead Material, maintenance and repair services, test support services, training, engineering support services, and associated data.  Upon completion of the contract, all EDMs and the complete technical data package (hardware and software) will deliver to the Government to support future production.  
The RFP will be published in FEDBIZOPS on the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Interested offerors should watch FEDBIZOPS for the release of the RFP.  The RFP is anticipated for release in third quarter Government Fiscal Year [GFY] 2008, with award anticipated in late first quarter GFY 2009.  The Government anticipates awarding one or more cost plus research and development contracts based on best value. The period of performance is estimated to be from contract award in early GFY 2009; Preliminary Design Review [PDR] 6 months after contract award, Critical Design Review [CDR] one year after PDR, through completion of the Government Developmental Test (DT) and Operational Assessment in early first quarter GFY 2011.   Contractor DT will be conducted at the Contractor facilities.  The Government anticipates conducting Government DT at various Navy facilities on both the east and west coast.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The US EPA, OAR, ORIA intends to award a sole-source order using FAR 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Canberra Industries, Inc. the current manufacturer.  This request is to purchase Canberra alpha detectors and spectrometers.  Canberra instruments can only bereliably installed to existing RI&E equipment, maintained & repaired by the original manufacturer.  It is to be noted that RI&E already have a service contract with Canberra which holds a proprietary license on its equipment.  Since alpha spectroscopy detectors & spectrometers are such delicate instruments and each has its own original manufacturer specifications and tolerances, and they will be connected to and controlled by RI&E existing Canberra manufactured equipment/software, the requested Canberra equipment are the only equipment that may be connected to and controlled by RI&E existing Canberra manufactured equipment/software.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Rasheda Sherron via email at sherron.rasheda@epa.gov.  The Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, Radiation and Indoor Environments National Laboratory (ORIA/R&IE) is continuing its effort to provide defensible radiological analytical values to the Public and other Governmental Agencies. R&IE supports Superfund projects in cleanup, removal, remediation, and radiological emergencies for EPA Regions, and provides the Department of Energy (DOE) with analytical results from environmental sampling at nuclear testing era sites. In providing this support we have to maintain our analytical instrumentation hardware to peak performance and maintain original manufacturer specification.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NAICS code 541620:  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to negotiate on a sole source basis with  Restore America's Estuaries. Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), which allows for negotiations without fulland open competition if there is only one responsible source. Project Identification:  Support and participation at conference hosted by Restore America's Estuaries focusing on coastal  habitat restoration.Project Description:EPA plans a sole source purchase to Restore America's Estuaries (RAE) in support of RAE's hosting an international Conference in Providence, Rhode Island, that will focus on all aspects of coastal and estuarine restoration.  The Conference will feature concurrent sessions and workshops based around themes such as coral reefs, shorelines, restoration in urban areas, beneficial use of dredge material, fish passage, and water quality.  Restore America's Estuaries is unique in that their mission is to preserve the nation's network of estuaries by protecting and restoring the lands and waters around them.  EPA's Oceans and Coastal Protection Division (OCPD) and Wetlands Division require the services of Restore America's Estuaries to use the Conference as a vehicle to forward its mission and promote water programs, activities, and products, to a broad international audience.  The Conference will also be an opportunity to engage estuary habitat restoration professionals and establish working groups that will continue to develop strategies for estuary restoration after the Conference has concluded.    Restore America's Estuaries agrees that EPA's Oceans and Coastal Protection Division and Wetlands Division will be involved in Conference planning events and will have a lead role in developing the various themes for the Conference.  Additionally, the contractor will provide exhibit space to EPA for the duration of the conference, complimentary admissions, copies of proceedings, and identification on all conference materials and publications.  Task Requirements:Task 1.    The Contractor shall work with the OCPD and the Wetlands Division so that EPA has a prominent role on the Steering Committees and visibility throughout the planning process and meeting.  This will allow EPA to promote its Water programs and products to a broad international audience of restoration professionals. Task 2.   The contractor shall provide a prominent exhibit area for an EPA display at the Restore America's Estuaries Conference in Providence, RI.  This will allow EPA to showcase current activities underway to manage and protect the nation's waters and gain additional exposure and recognition. Task 3.   The contractor shall provide 5 complimentary admissions to the Conference in recognition of EPA's support.Task 4.   Conference materials will recognize EPA, the Oceans and Coastal Protection Division, and Wetlands Division as Conference sponsors.  The program will reflect our role in many of the sessions, either as organizers, session chairs, exhibitors, or speakers.  Conference announcements and the proceedings will acknowledge EPA's Oceans and Coastal Protection Division and Wetlands Division participation and support. Task 5.   The contractor shall provide copies of the Proceedings Volume to EPA on CD for distribution following the Conference.7.  Period of Performance:	 One year following time of award. Justification of Sole SourceItem I.    Unique Experience:   Part of the mission of EPA's Office of Wetlands, Oceans, and Watersheds (OWOW) is to protect and maintain coastal watersheds by building partnerships, strengthening the capacity of our partners, sharing experience broadly and providing leadership and assistance to support community-based watershed management.  To accomplish this, OWOW requires expertise on coastal issues such as estuarine and coastal habitat restoration, and other issues that go toward preserving and sustaining our nation's estuaries.  Also, it is necessary to provide a forum to share this information and promote EPA's programs, activities, and products, with habitat restoration professionals and other interested entities so they may be used in the protection and restoration of our nation's estuaries.  
Restore America's estuaries will be hosting an international conference in Providence, RI this October, 2008 that will focus on protection and restoration of our nation's estuaries, and bring together professionals involved in habitat restoration to review current issues and trends in the field.  The Conference will feature concurrent sessions and workshops based around themes such as coral reefs, shorelines, restoration in urban areas, beneficial use of dredge material, fish passage, and water quality.  Restore America's Estuaries is the premier national non-profit organization solely devoted to working with community, private, and governmental organizations to preserve the heritage of our nation's estuaries.  RAE has established a network of stakeholders and advisors that represent a broad consortium of academic, conservation, business, and government interests.  This network has the unique capability of bringing in national expertise on estuarine habitat restoration issues and a unique capacity to promote public awareness.                                                                                                                       Item II.   Creating Partnerships:   There are many different stakeholders involved with restoring estuarine habitat but frequently coordination and networking among these groups is not occurring.  Participants that RAE will bring together at the conference such as federal representatives from the FWS, NOAA, USGS, state and local agencies, international experts, and academic researchers will have the opportunity to share successful strategies for restoration and create partnerships.  This is anticipated to enhance the effectiveness of restoration efforts nationally and build capacity through the sharing of information.  
Item III.    Leveraging of Resources: The Restore America's Estuaries Conference is being supported by federal and state agencies, among others, at an estimated cost of about $200,000.  NOAA and FWS will be contributing approximately $50,000 apiece and USDA is expected to provide a similar amount.  EPA's support of ### and participation in developing the program, exhibit space, and Conference proceedings will leverage many more resources and reach many more people than ### alone could do. 							 This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting documentation, to martinez.thomas@epa.gov, phone number (202)564-1418, which establishes that their specifications meet EPA's requirement.  Documentation must be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by EPA. A determination not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of potential small businesses to provide services for the project titled: Manufacturing of Lot Release Support Panels.   The NAICS Code is 325413.  Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice.  However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents’ capacity and capability to provide the required services. The FDA conducts lot release of in vitro diagnostic test kits developed by independent manufacturers for use in screening blood and blood products.  The lot release process confirms the adequacy of each lot’s test performance using panels of specimens specifically selected and formulated to characterize the limits of test performance.  Once potential samples have been identified, FDA has a need for service functions related to preparation, sterility, characterization, storage and possibly dissemination of panels.

The potential small businesses shall receive, store, aliquot, transport and distribute infectious and non-infectious biological materials.  The FDA will need 2-3 panels made each year for a 5 year period of performance containing 5 to 10 members, with about 3,000 vials of each member.   Samples for each panel will be provided by the FDA, or may need help from the contractor in acquiring and/or purchasing candidate samples for panel production.

This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in this announcement. This request is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with 
DEM Solutions (USA) Inc., for renewal of existing single-user license for EDEM Software.

This License/software is for carrying out discrete element modeling, which is essential for the research program into the particle dynamics of material used in concrete. NIST require a renewal for single license, with an additional parallel processor key so that jobs can be run on two processors in a parallel fashion.

Based on NIST’s recent market research, NIST has only identified one source that can renew the required EDEM license DEM solutions (USA), Inc.

The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed- price purchase order.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, companies that believe they can fulfill the requirement may provide a written response to this notice and provide clear and unambiguous evidence to substantiate that capability. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competition.

SAIC-Frederick is the prime contactor for the National Cancer Institute at Frederick (NCI-Frederick). NCI-Frederick is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center which conducts basic and translational research focused primarily on cancer and AIDS.

The Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory (NCL; http://ncl.cancer.gov/), SAIC-Frederick, Inc. at NCI-Frederick conducts preclinical characterization of nanomaterial intended for cancer therapeutics and diagnostics. In this role, NCL provides contracted support to the NCI Alliance for Nanotechnology in Cancer (http://nano.cancer.gov/index.asp) and the inter-agency collaboration between NCI, NIST and FDA to help transition promising nanotechnology concepts from academia, government and industry, to the clinic. Due to the complexity and variety of multifunctional nanomaterial platforms in the R&D pipeline, NCL seeks to leverage the expertise and experience in academia, industry and government agencies in accelerating the transition of these concepts to clinical trials.

NCL intends to pursue public-private partnerships for co-development of improved instrumentation and standard methods and protocols for characterization of nanomaterial intended for biomedical applications.  The physico-chemical, in vitro and in vivo characterization of nanomaterial under physiological conditions requires instrumentation having detection, resolution and throughput beyond current capabilities.  For example, development of techniques and automation for electron microscopy of nanoparticles in tissues will allow scientists to verify biodistribution and localization. Other anticipated joint research and development projects include advanced measurement techniques to determine the structure, polydispersity and batch-to-batch consistency of functionalized nanoparticles and the conformation and distribution of their ligands.  

The private partner(s) in any proposed public-private partnership expect to derive certain benefits.  Partners to these cost-sharing agreements would have access to nanomaterial R&D, emerging platforms for clinical application, supplementary characterization methods and nanobiology standard and protocol development, however, all rights to third-party nanomaterials available to NCL will remain with the third party providers.  NCL would gain access to instrumentation R&D, application expertise, training, instrumentation protocol and standard development.  It is the intent of NCL to go beyond current mechanisms for collaborations, for example material transfer agreements, to pursue innovative measures such as co-location of facilities and infrastructure -- while under a framework of an appropriate business model, including collaborative agreements, cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs), Work for Others agreements, and other cost-sharing agreements, for the various aspects of the public private partnership.

Interested organizations may contact the NCL at 301-846-6939 or email ncl@mail.nih.gov

For example, if breakfast is provided, in a locality with a $49.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the breakfast rate in the locality is $9.00 per breakfast. Therefore, the cost of the breakfast provided at the conference cannot exceed $13.50 ($9.00 X 150%) per person.</p>
<p>If lunch will be provided in a locality with a $49.00 per day meal incidental expense M&amp;IE rate, the lunch rate in the locality is $13.00 per lunch. Therefore, the cost of the lunch provided at the conference cannot exceed $19.50 ($13.00 X 150%) per person.</p>
<p>The new guideline defines refreshments as light food and drinks served at breaks and include such items as coffee, tea, milk, juice, soft drinks, donuts, bagels, fruit, pretzels, cookies, chips, or muffins. Under the new guidelines the cost of these items, plus any hotel service costs, cannot exceed 23 percent of the locality (M&amp;IE) for both morning and afternoon breaks. For the Denver, CO area, the M&amp;IE rate is $49.00 per person. Therefore, the cost of the refreshments cannot exceed $11.27 ($49.00 X 23%) per person per <br />day.</p>
<p>Any hotel source interested and capable of providing lodging at the Federal per diem rates and meeting the new guideline requirements should submit a statement of capabilities, to include sleeping and meeting capacity, floor charts, and food and beverage menus, to the point of contact identified. The food and beverage menus should support the pricing mentioned above, including hotel service costs: breakfast, $12.00 per person; lunch, $18.00 per person; and refreshments for both morning and afternoon breaks, $14.72 per person.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine sources with the capability and availability to meet requirements for a Continuity of Operations (COOP) purposes, such as severe weather, terrorist attack or civil unrest, US Coast Guard Sector (hereinafter SEC) New Orleans’ Incident Command Post (hereinafter ICP), which is a 24 hour, 7 day a week operational command center, will need to be stood up in a safe location that is away from current and potential future COOP hazards and dangers, especially hurricanes.  The US Coast Guard Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic (MLCLANT) is the procuring office for this action.  This facility will also need to accommodate certain logistical needs in order to properly lead US Coast Guard during current and post COOP operations.  The US Coast Guard requires a contracting vehicle to be in place that will allow us to have the “first right” to use the facility as an ICP in an event of a Category 3 or greater hurricane to hit the New Orleans area resulting in evacuation of New Orleans, LA.  At least 72 hours prior to landfall of anything equal or greater than a category 3 hurricane, an advance team will be deployed to this location to set up for eventual ICP stand up.  At 48 hours prior to landfall, a decision will be made to expand the operation and more personnel will be arriving.  If a similar storm to Hurricane Katrina hit, this will require the USCG to stay for an undetermined period of time, due to the inability to return to normal operations in the New Orleans area.  Sector New Orleans will be forced to reconstitute full operations from this satellite location.  The requirements for the facility are as follows:  The ICP location needs to be located in Natchez, Mississippi.  Nextel Reception (which is the Coast Guard cellular phone service)  Area should have both Sprint wireless and Centennial Wireless coverage.  Hospitals must be nearby in addition to other basic amenities (commercial airport, shopping centers, sport facilities) that are able to support SEC New Orleans (a 500-person command) if the Coast Guard cannot return to their office in downtown New Orleans.  Office space/conference rooms will be needed for the ICP to be set up and run by the U.S. Coast Guard Sector New Orleans Hurricane Evacuation Team.  Office space/conference rooms to house a day/night, 24-hour watch.  One of the rooms must be able to accommodate approximately 4,000 square feet and another boardroom style space that must be no smaller than 300 square feet.  The 4,000 square feet office space/conference room must be available for pre-installed communication upgrades that will accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 40 phone/fax lines and 40 internet connections spread out in the room.  We will also need the flexibility to increase the amount of lines needed as the operation grows.  The 4,000 square foot office space/conference room must be able to accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 2 cable lines.  The facility should be able to provide tables and chairs for at least 150 people.  Parking will be needed for 200 vehicles.  Contract to include trash pick up of conference room and general cleaning of floors and available restrooms.  Meal services to provide three well balanced and nutritious meals per day and a midnight rations (finger food) service.  The convention center to manage all meal-related business such as staff to charge and collect monies for each meal for each member passing through buffet style serving line, accountability of meals served, set up, pick up, sanitation, meal preparation, eating facility, tables, chairs, utensils, napkins, menu preparation, etc, as if running a full time restaurant exclusively for U. S. Coast Guard personnel and related subcontractors or partners as deemed authorized by the USCG.  Approximately 95 hotel rooms will be needed as soon as it is known that normal operations will be impossible in the New Orleans area.  It is requested the United States Coast Guard have the “first right” to 95 rooms.  Two of the total 95 rooms must be suites for high ranking military personnel.  An airport with a runway at least 6500 X 150 feet must be within 10 miles of the ICP location.  All office space/conference rooms must be within the same facility and hotel accommodations need to be within close proximity (walking distance) (less than ¼ miles).  This requirement is necessary since US Coast Guard military and civilian personnel will be working long shifts throughout the day and night.  It is the Coast Guard’s intent to issue an IDIQ (indefinite delivery indefinite quantity) to obtain services.  Interested sources should provide the following information via to the address below.  Name of Company and Address, Point of Contact and phone number, Business Size (small, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business or women-owned small business concerns). The NAICS code is 721110. The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 million.  The period of performance is anticipated for five-one year ordering periods commencing August 2008.  No other sources sought notice will be provided.  Interested vendors should respond to this notice by Close of Business June 4, 2008.  Competition and set-aside decisions may be based on the results of this market research.  At this time, no solicitation exists; therefore please do not request a copy of the solicitation.  This notice is for market research purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. The Government reserves the right to consider any arrangement as deemed appropriate for this procurement.

<DESC>I. Introduction:

This is a notification that an Industry Day will be held on Thursday 12 June 2008 at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. The intent of Industry Day is to gather and provide information on a potential requirement that the 46 Test Wing describes in Section II and III of this notice.  This will be a multi-step process with the first step being Industry Day. In order to attend Industry Day a Visit Request will need to be submitted by close of business (COB) 6 June 2008 to the point of contact listed in Section IV. The Visit Request is the only piece of information required prior to Industry Day. After Industry Day; Contractors will have two weeks to submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) that address items listed in Section III of this notice and additional information that is discussed at Industry Day. The SOC should be submitted directly to Dana Alexander at dana.alexander@eglin.af.mil by 1400 EST 27 June 2008. Include in the SOC: Company Title, Company Address, Technical and Contracting Points of Contact, Phone, Fax & Email and identify the size of your business. Possible NAICS code for this effort is 541330 with a size standard of $4.5M. Contractors that are unable to attend Industry Day will not be eliminated from competition for this effort. Based upon the information we receive at Industry Day and through the SOC the Government will determine if a contract is appropriate. At that point a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued and the information gained through Industry Day will be included in the RFP. Contractors are reminded that issuance of this notice does not obligate the Government to pay any travel costs, SOC preparation costs, or to award any contract. 

II.  Background: 

The 46th Test Wing (46 RANSS) is requesting information on ground-based instrumentation radar systems that will improve and modernize the Eglin Test & Training Complex (ETTC) Time-Space-Position Information (TSPI) measurement and collection capability.  Eglin’s main TSPI radar is the AN/FPS-16.  The goal is to utilize and leverage modern technology (e.g., radar, infra-red (IR), multi-spectral, or digital signal processing techniques) to improve the accuracy, reliability, and cost to operate and maintain this function.  It is also desirable to investigate other capabilities of these modern systems to determine if there are characteristics or functions that may be leveraged to provide customers with new or improved data products and/or capabilities that currently do not exist on the ETTC.   

Currently, the ETTC possesses, or is acquiring, the following TSPI radar systems:

• Seven fixed AN/FPS-16 C-band pulse radars located in three fixed locations
• One transportable BAE RIR-980 C-band pulse radar (on-going development; IOC Mar 09)
• One mobile Weibel MFTR-2100/40 X-Band CW Doppler radar (on-going development; IOC Dec 08)
• One mobile Weibel MSL-60037 X-Band CW Doppler radar

III. Requirements Description:

1) Improve overall TSPI accuracies achieved by current ETTC TSPI radar systems.

2) Improve operations and maintenance lifecycle costs relative to existing systems.  

3) Systems considered shall provide tracking capability for small and difficult-to-detect targets and systems under test (SUTs).  SUTs can include aircraft and air-to-air, surface-to-air, and air-to-surface weapons systems.

4) Systems considered shall be capable of TSPI measurement and collection in all weather conditions.

5) Provide for multi-object tracking capability and real-time, multi-object TSPI solutions.  

6) Retain the capability for tracking cooperative targets (i.e., beacon tracking).

7) Leverage existing technologies and military applications to reduce development costs.

8) Mobility, transportability, and environmental survivability shall be important consideration factors.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City Regional office, Boulder City Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to the University of Colorado, 3100 Marine Street, Room 481, Boulder City, CO 80309-0572, for advanced decision support for Water and Environmental systems (CU-CADSWES) for upgrades and enhancements of the Riverware modeling tool and the Hydrological database (HDB).
Since 1993, Reclamation, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the U.S. Geological Survey, and the University of Colorado's Center for Advanced Decision Support for Water and Environmental Systems (CADSWES) have participated in a collaborative research and development program to develop decision support tools for water management.  Two major applications from this program are used by Boulder City operations office:  Riverware, a generalized river and reservoir data management system and the Hydrological Database.  The contractor (CADSWES) developed, enhances, and maintains these packages for the users and is, therefore, the only entity able to provide these services.  Calculation Application - Derivation Application Replacement: To further the development of the Hydrologic database (HDB) as the database of record for the Boulder Canyon Operations Office and to satisfy the Calculation Application functional requirements, CADSWES will continue to refine the Derivation Application replacement functionality of the Calculation Application.  CADSWES has completed the first version of this application under separate funding and it is currently being tested and recently put into production. The results of the testing and implementation of the Computation Processor and the modified HDB database will determine the additional required tasks for CADSWES. The tasks will include, but are not limited to, the fixing of any identified Processor programming and HDB database bugs. CADSWES will also enhance or modify existing Computation Processor algorithm code to meet the minimal functional requirements of the algorithms or to provide enhancements to existing algorithms.  Create Additional Required Calculation Application Algorithms: CADSWES will design, code and test algorithms as identified by the Boulder Canyon Operations Office (BCOO).  These algorithms are in addition to those that are delivered with the Derivation Application Replacement.  This work also includes documentation of the algorithms in an Algorithm User's Guide.  Specific algorithm requirements will be identified by BCOO staff prior to the start of work, and will include the following:- Flow algorithms currently performed in the XConnect telemetry software.- Mass balance algorithms such as daily gain/loss at various river reaches.- Algorithms that will replace calculations currently performed in spreadsheets and in other programs outside of the HDB.The budget includes travel funding for a 1-2 day trip to Reclamation offices to attend meetings to discuss the algorithm requirements with BCOO River Operations staff.Documentation of HDB Tables - HDB Data Dictionary: Lower Colorado Region HDB users have identified the need to be able to reference, in detail, of all the HDB tables.  The documentation needs to define the structure of each table, as well as descriptive text of the meaning of each field in the tables.  BCOO has created a sample document that contains much of this information - however it is incomplete and does not contain any of the new tables.  This function is best performed by the HDB developer.  After completion of this document, it is desired that CADSWES will provide updates to the document as the HDB schema changes, as part of the CADSWES HDB documentation library. Enhance RiverWare's Multiple-Run Management (MRM) and the Data Management Interface (DMI) Capabilities: Enhancements to RiverWare's MRM and DMI utilities are required to improve Reclamation's capability to model climate change scenarios and climate variability on the Colorado River beyond the Index Sequential Method. The required capability is to perform at least 1000 simulations in CRSS using at least 1000 input DMIs. (During the climate variability modeling performed for the Shortage and Coordinated Operations Final EIS (FEIS), the limitation was approximately 125 runs before a memory error occurred.). Further it is desired to reduce the total run time for 1000 CRSS simulation from the current estimated 15 hours to approximately 2 hours. This task is to explore possible approaches to meeting these needs and to implement one or more agreed-upon enhancements as possible under this budget. Among the approaches to be investigated is an execution management utility that would spawn runs on multiple machines simultaneously and then recombine the results of individual traces into a single RiverWare Data File (RDF) for analysis purposes. Other approaches will be considered (including upgraded hardware) and combined with improvements currently under way to improve runtime performance and MRM capabilities. Enhance RiverWare to Support Davis-Parker Hourly Scheduling:LC wishes to replace the spreadsheet application for hourly scheduling of hydro units and releases at Davis and Parker with a RiverWare model with the same functionality. The preliminary phase, accomplished by CADSWES under user support funding, identified requirements and a preliminary design. The work effort under this task will complete the design and develop enhancements required such as new methods for power release, modified dispatch methods and new SCT functionality to allow the RiverWare model to serve the needs of the schedulers. This initial phase does not include any modifications to HDB. (The spreadsheet does not currently communicate with HDB, but future enhancements may be identified to facilitate that communication.) Re-implementation of runtime diagnostics in RiverWare: Diagnostics were first introduced in RiverWare about 12 years ago. Since that time, the functionality and complexity of the software have evolved significantly and the original design of the runtime diagnostics is now inadequate. For example, adequate diagnostics are not possible for expression slots and methods on computational subbasins as well as some DMIs. Further, the current implementation uses too much runtime memory, always of concern for large models. Also, new development is slowed by the need to retrofit to the difficult-to-maintain diagnostics management. A design for new diagnostics management will be developed and implemented. The cost for this significant task will be shared among several sponsors of RiverWare. Rulebased Simulation Improvements: This task will provide for improvements to the Rulebased Simulation including one level of "undo" in the rules editor, improvement of the palette for easier rule construction, and simplifications of the display such as replacement of "@currentTimestep" with "t". In addition, this task will contribute to a feasibility study and high level design for a debugging capability in the rules that allows setting breakpoints, stepping through the logic much as a software debugging utility.  These tasks are cost-shared with other sponsors.

Anticipated award date: June 4th, 2008.

<DESC>BACKGROUND

The US Department of Transportation, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) Office of Hazardous Materials Safety is the Federal safety authority for ensuring the safe transport of hazardous materials by air, rail, highway, and water.  Federal Hazardous Materials (HM) Law and HM regulations (HMR) currently require shippers of HM to create a shipping paper that conforms to requirements in 49 CFR 172 Subpart C and provide the paper to the carrier.  

Shipping papers are an important part of necessary hazard communication that, along with placarding, marking and labeling, keep the transportation of HM safe and reliable.  Shipping papers are intended to:
•  Communicate hazard information from the shipper to the carrier; 
•  Provide hazard information to handling and acceptance personnel (to include Pilots,    Captains, drivers);  
•  Provide verification to the operator that the shipment complies with HMR requirements;
•  Provide pertinent information to emergency response personnel in the event of an HM incident; and
•  Provide pertinent information to the appropriate authority as part of an incident investigation. 

PHMSA is investigating the possibility of leveraging technologies to improve HM transportation by allowing companies to communicate hazard information electronically in lieu of using paper shipping documents.  In intermodal transportation of HM, often carrier personnel at seaports, airports and rail yards are required to enter information from a shipping paper into the carrier’s information system.  These redundant data entry efforts can lead to incorrect information and deficiencies in the shipping paper farther down the logistics chain, which can delay or frustrate shipments and lead to enforcement and fines.  A standardized electronic communication of shipping paper information may eliminate the need to re-enter information, therefore reducing frustrated shipments, congestion and increasing efficiency.

PHMSA is also interested in a standardized system of communicating shipping paper information between shippers and carriers that incorporates a method to immediately and accurately notify and inform emergency responders in the event of a HM incident. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has made two recommendations about improving the electronic transfer of hazard information to emergency responders. 

PHMSA is currently working to define the regulatory guidelines necessary to amend the current HMR shipping paper requirements to allow the electronic transfer of hazard communication shipping paper information in lieu of paper documentation.  PHMSA is evaluating the potential for electronic communication of hazard information to improve safety and increase efficiencies in the transport system by:  

•  Facilitating the flow of hazard information to emergency responders prior to arrival on a HM incident scene;
•  Increasing the amount of information available to emergency responders prior to arrival on a HM incident scene;
•  Improving the accuracy of hazard communication by having the party most familiar with the product create the data file; and
•  Creating a standard communication vehicle for multimodal shipments, therefore reducing the need to redraft documents at ports, rail yards, etc.

DESCRIPTION 

The primary purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information on available technologies that will allow companies involved in the transportation of HM the ability to safely, effectively and efficiently communicate hazard information between shipper and carrier, and when necessary or requested, to emergency responders and/or regulatory enforcement personnel.  

PHMSA is seeking solutions that are broad-based and not tool-driven.  It is imperative that the proposed solutions have the ability to communicate specific hazard information to emergency response personnel without any added requirements on response agencies and have the capability to communicate with agencies with diverse technological capabilities (e.g., urban HM Response Team and rural volunteer fire department).

PHMSA’s success in improving safety with the use of electronic documentation in lieu of shipping papers depends on its understanding the pertinent technologies.  The purpose of this RFI is to help PHMSA understand what electronic communication technologies are available to HM transportation entities and the capabilities of the technologies to transfer hazard information in the following situations:

•  From shipper to carrier (and freight forwarder, etc);
•  From carrier to operator (pilot, captain, driver, engineer, etc);
•  From carrier to regulatory inspection and enforcement personnel; and
•  From carrier to various emergency response agencies (Urban HM Response Team to rural volunteer fire department).
NOTE: Any communication method must not require any additional tools (bar code readers, scanners, etc.) be used by regulatory, enforcement, and emergency response personnel.

CAPABILITY STATEMENT REQUIREMENTS
This is a Request for Information (RFI) announcement only. This is not a request for competitive proposal or qualifications. PHMSA will use the results from this RFI to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy. A party’s response to this RFI does not bind the Government or party into any agreement.

All vendors with an appropriate product relating to the requirements set forth in this RFI are invited to submit a Capability Statement and contact information. The Capability Statement should discuss the product’s capabilities as against the requirements, the product’s system requirements, the product’s integration specification (if available), and any other specific and pertinent information that would enhance PHMSA’s understanding of the information submitted.

Please indicate in your response which capabilities can be provided via commercial off the shelf software versus custom developed solutions. For requirements that are met by commercial off the shelf software, please also include the product name, release number and release date. 

PHMSA must receive the written capability statement no later than July 30, 2008, at 4:00 PM EDT. Submit one hard copy to Eric L. Hilton, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, Office of Contracts and Procurement, ATTN: PHA-30, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE, Room E22-229, Washington, DC 20590. Submit also on electronic copy in PDF format to eric.hilton@dot.gov

<DESC>ERDC Contracting Office intends to solicit on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Thermo Electron North America LLC, 5225 Verona Road, Madison, WI 53711.  This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)-only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Thermo Electron North America LLC is the only known source capable of meeting the Governments requirements due to several feature functions offered by the Evolution 600 Spectrophotometer and accessories.  This instrument is best suited for the reasons that it has a very accurate wavelength range to show very fine structures, and functions as both a UV-Vis Spectrophotometer and a Stopped Flow Spectrometer due to dual mixing chambers to allow for the study of reaction kinetics.  This spectrophotometer has a wavelength range from 190 to 900 nm and is accurate to within 0.10 nm.  It has an internal spectral bandwidth that is selectable from 0.2 to 4.0 nm.  This will allow the operator to set the spectrophotometer to necessary bandwidth according to concentration of the solution.  It comes with RS-232-C interface to allow direct connection to a computer for use with the very powerful VISIONpro and VISIONlife software that accompanies it.  This software allows scanning applications to be run with all peak data being saved into a spreadsheet for further analysis, adds the ability to monitor and calculate reaction kinetics, and measures the concentration of a sample overtime.  The high-performance Evolution 600 offers the widest selection of accessories to measure the most demanding samples. Most samples used are the aqueous solutions and rates of reaction are very important.  The Evolution 600 offers a Rapid Mixing Accessory which mixes two samples together with no lag time and takes an immediate recording.  Via data acquired with this accessory, VISIONpro software can calculate the kinetics for the reaction.  A necessary accessory to this is the Peltier Water Circulator.  This accessory allows the sample to be set at a certain temperature.  This is necessary for studies that deal with degradation/formation at increased or decreased temperature. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 CST on 2 June 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  No RFP will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent.  Interested parties may submit any information for consideration by the Government to Kimberly.L.Dulaney@usace.army.mil with solicitation number referenced in the subject line.<BR>

These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners to support Consular posts overseas.  The choice to use the D230 as opposed to other barcode readers available is that this unit is a drop-in replacement to the barcode scanners previously used (Gryphon D200 and D220 barcode scanners that have recently reached end-of-life).   The continued use of Datalogic scanners obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple scanners.  In addition, the barcode scanners require customized software.  Because the D230 model is similar to the models previously used, no changes will be required for the customized software due to driver incompatibilities. The Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanner meets the following requirements:	The scanner works with both NIV (Non-Immigrant Visa) and IVO (Immigrant Visa Overseas) applications. 	The scanner reads both one-dimensional (linear) and two-dimensional (stacked) barcodes.	The scanner must use and draw its power from the USB 2.0 interface. This will remove the need to purchase 110-volt and 220-volt power supplies.	The scanner provides full compatibility with every application that exploits the USB interface: USB KBD (keyboard) Wedge, USB COM (communication) emulation and USB IBM POS (point of sale).As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.<BR><BR>CA/CST has selected the Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners because results obtain by the Bureaus System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoSs processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  
The Datalogic Gryphon D230 USB Barcode Scanners has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The server has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.  The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p><br />PART I: GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>A. Background</p>
<p>The National Mediation Board (NMB) prepares an annual Performance Accountability Report (PAR) in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and the formats prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The PAR includes comparative financial statements for the current and immediately preceding fiscal years. NMB has had a financial statement audit performed each year in accordance with the Accountability of Tax Dollars ACT (ATDA) of 2002.</p>
<p>The NMB is an independent federal agency established by the 1934 amendments to the Railway Labor Act of 1926 whose primary mission is to prevent or minimize labor-management disputes affecting interstate commerce. Pursuant to the Railway Labor Act, NMB programs provide an integrated dispute resolution process to effectively meet the statutory objective of minimizing work stoppages in the airline and railroad industries. The NMB's integrated process specifically designed to promote four statutory goals:<br /><br />&bull; The prompt and orderly resolution of disputes arising out of the negotiation of new or revised collective bargaining agreements:<br />&bull; The avoidance of interruptions of interstate commerce:<br />&bull; The protection of employee rights to self-organization; and <br />&bull; The prompt and orderly resolution of disputes over the interpretation or application of existing agreements.</p>
<p>The agency spends about $13 million of appropriated funds annually.</p>
<p>B. Scope</p>
<p>The Contractor shall perform an audit of NMB's financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, and succeeding years, in accordance with Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (subsequent revisions), and OMB Bulletin No. 07-04, Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statements (Bulletin). The Contractor shall follow the GAO/PCIE Financial Audit Manual (FAM) and subsequent issuances. Accordingly the Contractor shall perform the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Determine whether the basic statements and related notes present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities, and net position; net costs; changes in net position; budgetary resources; and, if applicable, custodial activity in accordance with paragraph 6.2 of OMB Bulletin No. 07-04.<br />&bull; Obtain an understanding of the components of internal control and assess the level of control risk relevant to the assertions embodied in the classes of transactions, account balances, and disclosure components of the financial statements in accordance with paragraph 6.8 of OMB Bulletin 07-04.</p>
<p>&bull; Perform tests of compliance with laws and regulations in accordance with 6.12 of OMB Bulletin 07-04.</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare separate audit reports on the financial statements, internal control, and compliance with laws and regulations in accordance with Section 7 of OMB Bulletin 07-04.</p>
<p>C. Payment</p>
<p>Payment shall be made in accordance with the clauses of the contract entitled "Prompt Payment" (FAR 52.232-25), Progress Payments (FAR 52-232-16) and Payments (FAR 52.232-1).</p>
<p>This is a one-year firm fixed price contract, with two one-year options. Payment will be as follows after approval by the Director, Office of Administration: 40 percent on the date of the draft report and 60 percent on the date that the NMB approves the final report.</p>
<p>Labor Category</p>
<p>The estimated level-of-effort to perform this task is 600 man hours for the base year. In your submission, please divide the CFO audit into four phases, including price quotations and milestone dates for each of the following phases:</p>
<p>&bull; Planning<br />&bull; Internal Control<br />&bull; Substantive<br />&bull; Reporting</p>
<p>PART II. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Task - Audit of Financial Statements</p>
<p>The NMB's financial statements are prepared in accordance with OMB Circular A-136, and Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS).</p>

<p>Planning Phase</p>
<p>The Planning Phase shall include a high level review of the agency's organization, controls and risks. The Contractor shall gain an understanding of, and document, the agency's internal control structure including the control environment, control procedures and accounting systems.</p>
<p>Internal Control Phase</p>
<p>The Internal Control Phase shall provide an understanding of the elements of the agency's internal control structure and how the assessment of this structure is used in performing the financial statement audit. The Contractor will be responsible for obtaining sufficient, reliable audit evidence as to whether the NMB's internal control structure provides reasonable assurance of achieving internal control objectives.</p>
<p>Substantive Phase</p>
<p>The Substantive Phase shall consist of detailed tests to form conclusions about whether financial statement amounts are reliable, accurate, complete, and include all disclosures. The Contractor shall perform some degree of substantive testing on all account balances. The level of testing required will be dependent on the degree or reliance being placed upon the internal controls that affect the accounts.</p>
<p>Reporting Phase</p>
<p>The Report Phase shall be the culmination of all work that is performed during the audit. The Contractor will follow up as needed, develop overall conclusions and communicate them to management. Also, perform several quality control functions, as well as prepare reports. The audit report shall be made up of at least the following three parts:</p>
<p>A. A complete overall analytical review of procedures, making sure that the NMB is in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards (AICPA, GAO and OMB).<br />B. A report on internal controls which conform with the requirements of Government Auditing Standards and OMB Bulletin 93-06 Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statement's.</p>
<p>C. A report on the agency's compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall, if applicable, provide a written management letter of suggestions for improvement for those matters which are not considered to be material weaknesses or reportable conditions in the agency's internal control structure.</p>
<p>Audit Management</p>
<p>In performing the audit, the Contractor shall adhere to the following:</p>
<p>A. The Contractor shall arrange entrance and exit conferences to be attended by key agency official. The entrance conference provides an opportunity for the Contractor to discuss the overall audit approach with agency officials.

During the course of the audit, and in the progress reports in the form of briefings, the Contractor shall discuss the status of the audit, including the progress to date compared with the audit plan and time scheduled or any problems the Contractor has encountered or that have come to the Contractor's attention that could impact the opinion on the financial statements, the report on internal controls, the report on compliance with laws and regulation or completion of agreed upon tasks or the due date of deliverables.</p>
<p>C. It is the responsibility of the Office of Administration to ensure that all records are available, all accounting entries and adjustments are made, and all other necessary steps are taken to make it possible for the audit firm to perform the work necessary to be able to present the final audit report no later than November 4, 2008.</p>
<p>D. The Contractor shall, at the conclusion of the audit, provide hard copy of all working papers, drafts and final reports which become the property of the agency. The Contractor's work papers shall be subject to access and review by the GAO and any other oversight organization deemed appropriate by the agency or the contracting offices' technical representative (COTR).</p>

BUY AMERICAN ACT/BALANCE OF PAYMENTS PROGRAM				EXHIBIT B

1.	BUY AMERICAN ACT – CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS  (FAR 52.225-9)(MAY 2002)

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-- 
"Component" means any article, material, or supply incorporated directly into construction materials. 
"Construction material" means an article, material, or supply brought to the construction site by the Contractor or a subcontractor for incorporation into the building or work. The term also includes an item brought to the site preassembled from articles, materials, or supplies. However, emergency life safety systems, such as emergency lighting, fire alarm, and audio evacuation systems, that are discrete systems incorporated into a public building or work and that are produced as complete systems, are evaluated as a single and distinct construction material regardless of when or how the individual parts or components of those systems are delivered to the construction site. Materials purchased directly by the Government are supplies, not construction material. 
"Cost of components" means-- 
(1)	For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation 
costs to the place of incorporation into the construction material (whether or not such costs are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or 
(2)	For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of 
the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs associated with the manufacture of the end product. 
"Domestic construction material" means-- 
(1) An unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United States; or 
(2) A construction material manufactured in the United States, if the cost of its components mined, 
produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind for which non-availability determinations have been made are treated as domestic. 
"Foreign construction material" means a construction material other than a domestic construction material. 
"United States" means the 50 States and the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and possessions, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and any other place subject to U.S. jurisdiction, but does not include leased bases. 
(b) Domestic preference. (1) This clause implements the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a - 10d) and the Balance of Payments Program by providing a preference for domestic construction material. The Contractor shall use only domestic construction material in performing this contract, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this clause. 
(2) This requirement does not apply to the construction material or components listed by the Government as follows: _________________________________________________________________________________
[Contracting Officer to list applicable excepted materials or indicate "none"] 
(3) The Contracting Officer may add other foreign construction material to the list in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause if the Government determines that-- 
(i)	The cost of domestic construction material would be unreasonable. The cost of a particular 
domestic construction material subject to the requirements of the Buy American Act is unreasonable when the cost of such material exceeds the cost of foreign material by more than 6 percent; 
(ii)	The application of the restriction of the Buy American Act to a particular construction material would be impracticable or inconsistent with the public interest; or 
(iii)	The construction material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in 
sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality. 




										Exhibit B
										Page 2

 (c) Request for determination of inapplicability of the Buy American Act. (1)(i) Any Contractor request to use foreign construction material in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause shall include adequate information for Government evaluation of the request, including-- 
	
(A) A description of the foreign and domestic construction materials; 
(B) Unit of measure; 
(C) Quantity; 
(D) Price; 
(E) Time of delivery or availability; 
(F) Location of the construction project; 
(G) Name and address of the proposed supplier; and 
(H) A detailed justification of the reason for use of foreign construction materials cited in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this clause. 
(i)	A request based on unreasonable cost shall include a reasonable survey of the market and a completed price comparison table in the format in paragraph (d) of this clause. 
(iii) The price of construction material shall include all delivery costs to the construction site and 
any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free certificate may be issued). 
(ii)	Any Contractor request for a determination submitted after contract award shall explain 
why the Contractor could not reasonably foresee the need for such determination and could not have requested the determination before contract award. If the Contractor does not submit a satisfactory explanation, the Contracting Officer need not make a determination. 
(2) If the Government determines after contract award that an exception to the Buy American Act applies and the Contracting Officer and the Contractor negotiate adequate consideration, the Contracting Officer will modify the contract to allow use of the foreign construction material. However, when the basis for the exception is the unreasonable price of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is not less than the differential established in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(3) Unless the Government determines that an exception to the Buy American Act applies, use of foreign construction material is noncompliant with the Buy American Act or Balance of Payments Program. 
(d) Data. To permit evaluation of requests under paragraph (c) of this clause based on unreasonable cost, the Contractor shall include the information and any applicable supporting data based on the survey of suppliers.

2.	NOTICE OF BUY AMERICAN ACT – CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS (FAR 52.225-10) (MAY 2002)

(a) Definitions. "Construction material," "domestic construction material," and "foreign construction material," as used in this provision, are defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled "Buy American Act-Construction Materials" (Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.225-9). 
(b) Requests for determinations of inapplicability. An offeror requesting a determination regarding the inapplicability of the Buy American Act should submit the request to the Contracting Officer in time to allow a determination before submission of offers. The offeror shall include the information and applicable supporting data required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9 in the request. If an offeror has not requested a determination regarding the inapplicability of the Buy American Act before submitting its offer, or has not received a response to a previous request, the offeror shall include the information and supporting data in the offer. 
(c) Evaluation of offers. (1) The Government will evaluate an offer requesting exception to the requirements of the Buy American Act, based on claimed unreasonable cost of domestic 
construction material, by adding to the offered price the appropriate percentage of the cost of such foreign construction material, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9. 



										EXHIBIT B
										Page 3

(2) If evaluation results in a tie between an offeror that requested the substitution of foreign construction material based on unreasonable cost and an offeror that did not request an exception, the Contracting Officer will award to the offeror that did not request an exception based on unreasonable cost. 
(d) Alternate offers. (1) When an offer includes foreign construction material not listed by the Government in this solicitation in paragraph (b)(2) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9, the offeror also may submit an alternate offer based on use of equivalent domestic construction material. 
(2) If an alternate offer is submitted, the offeror shall submit a separate Standard Form 1442 for the alternate offer, and a separate price comparison table prepared in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9 for the offer that is based on the use of any foreign construction material for which the Government has not yet determined an exception applies. 
(3) If the Government determines that a particular exception requested in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause at FAR 52.225-9 does not apply, the Government will evaluate only those offers based on use of the equivalent domestic construction material, and the offeror shall be required to furnish such domestic construction material. An offer based on use of the foreign construction material for which an exception was requested-- 
(i) Will be rejected as non-responsive if this acquisition is conducted by sealed bidding; or 
(ii) May be accepted if revised during negotiations.

                   WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
be:

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
   a wage determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
and 3.) should be followed.

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process described here, initial contact should be with the
Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage
payment data, project description, area practice material,
etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.

Such taxation does notconstitutea tax levied on the Federal Government; rather it is a tax levied on thecontractor for which the contractor is liable. However, the Federal Governmentisexempt from state and local taxation. Therefore, the contractor shall stateseparately on its invoices taxes excluded from the contract price, and thecontracting officer agrees to either pay the amount of the taxes to thecontractor or provide evidence necessary to sustain an exemption.(d) No exemption certificate is required.L-349,  Submission Of Electronic Proposals:(a) Offerors shall also submit their proposals electronically to SPAWAR underthe instructions contained in this provision.

<DESC>Modification to extend RFI closing to Monday, June 23, 2008.  Air Conditioning Systems - Performance Based Logistics (ACS-PBL) Initiative.  The Defense Logistics Agency's PBL initiative is in support of Air Conditioning Plant Systems located on CVN 68-75, CVN 76 & 77 and planned for the CVN 78 Aircraft Carriers, located worldwide. See website:  www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/ACSPBL/index.html All updates and information concerning this project will be posted to website:  www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/acspbl/index.html.  The closing of this RFI will be on Monday June23, 2008.

Air Condition Plant Systems, Performance Based Logistics Initiative
ACPS ? PBL, Request for Information (RFI)

Request for Information:  This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations as how best to define requirements for a full service Performance Based Logistics (PBL) solicitation/contract in support of Air Conditioning Plant Systems located on CVN 68 - 75 and CVN 76, 77 & 78 Class Aircraft Carriers.   A future solicitation/contract would provide total support and management services in support of Aircraft Carriers located worldwide. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

Background:  DSCC is the lead DLA center for maritime weapon systems.  DSCC is responsible for providing the Navy with the highest level of support, worldwide.  It is DLA?s goal to provide the best value to our military customer while reducing costs and improving efficiencies.  To meet our goals and future customer challenges, DSCC is continuing to benchmark with the private sector to determine which industry practices can be adopted to support the requirements of the Navy.  DSCC, in working with the Navy, has determined that a performance based contract would effectively support the warfighter.  Further review of the Navy PBL guide can be located at www.dscc.dla.mil/programs/acps/index.html.

Description of Need:  DSCC- Maritime is soliciting information from industry in regards to comprehensive support and responsibilities for the Air Conditioning Plant Systems located on CVN 68 - 75 and CVN 76, 77 & 78 Class Aircraft Carriers.  The purpose of this RFI is to determine suitability of the commercial marketplace to meet the Statement of Objectives (SOO), Enclosure 1, to assess current industry experience and capabilities, and to support the possibility of a full and open competition requirement to satisfy objectives identified in the SOO.  DSCC- Maritime intends to use information resulting from the RFI responses to aid in refining its acquisition strategy, budgeting assumptions, and performance specifications to be included in the RFP.

Objectives:  DSCC ? Maritime will utilize a full service PBL contract to enhance support of the Air Conditioning Plant Systems.  The overarching objective is to reduce cost without degrading current system readiness and reliability.  DSCC will capture industry?s cost estimates for requirements that are listed in the SOO.  Addressing elements, which are described in the SOO, is essential in the RFI responses. 
 
The Government contemplates possibly issuing a solicitation under FAR Part 15, that may result in a fixed price contract lasting10 ? years (2 year base with 8, one ? year options).  Estimated award date is 4th quarter FY 09.  Based on the results of a business case ?best value? analysis, DSCC ? Maritime, may elect to solicit/award by Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) to single or multiple vendors.  Prospective vendors may respond to individual or all CLIN?s.

Responses:  Written response to this RFI shall be limited to 25 pages, single space.  If material provided contains proprietary information, please mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned).  Response should include, but is not limited to the following:  
(A)	Company History:  A one page history to include; Small Business Administration (SBA) size classification; major products; and primary customer base.  Additionally RFI responders should provide examples of past experience that would warrant the Government?s consideration of the company as a prospective contractor for maintenance, supply support, training and all other services listed in the SOO.
(B)	Metrics:  Metrics recommended and methods to create and maintain a metrics database, for monitoring the performance of each functional area of the contract.  Also discuss how metrics can be used to promote an incentive/disincentive based contract award structure.  
(C)	Additional Information:  Technical or otherwise, the company deems necessary to aid the government in making an informed assessment of the suitability of the commercial marketplace to accomplish sustainment of the subject AC plants.  The technical responses should address elements in the SOO.
(D)	Cost:  Vendor should provide a Rough Order Magnitude (ROM) for elements addressed in the SOO.

Submission Information:  RFI responses shall be submitted no later than June 23, 2008 to DSCC ? Maritime, Attn:  FMGA (Laurie Gambert), ACS-PBL, 3990 East Broad St., Columbus OH  43218-3990.  Electronic responses are preferred and should be submitted to DSCC.ACSPBL@dla.mil.

Additional Information:  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by industry responses to this RFI.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in the Federal Business Opportunities website located at http://www.fbo.gov/.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the closing date for this RFI.  All interested parties are encourage to submit a capability statement to Jaclyn Stielper.




“Initiative for Maximizing the benefit of Passive Adverse event Collection Throughout a product’s life cycle” (IMPACT)

2. INTRODUCTION
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is soliciting information to identify potential approaches to assess the impact of spontaneous adverse event reports on regulatory decision-making throughout the product life cycle.  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to identify and learn more about potential research organizations that would be interested in and have the appropriate capabilities to conduct research described below.  This information will then be used to assist the FDA in developing a more targeted and structured Request for Proposal (RFP).

The FDA wishes to express its appreciation in advance to all organizations that choose to provide information in accordance with this announcement.

3. BACKGROUND
A crucial part of FDA’s mission is to perform pre-market and post-market safety and efficacy assessments of human drugs and therapeutic biologics (pharmaceutical products). Clinical trials that lead to formal marketing approval only begin to characterize the safety of a given pharmaceutical product. The collection and analysis of safety data by FDA staff must occur throughout the entire life cycle of the product in order to identify undesirable occurrences associated with the use of pharmaceutical products in humans that could not have been predicted by clinical trial data prior to approval. These undesirable occurrences, called adverse events, must be reported to FDA in order for the agency to carry out its mission of performing post-marketing safety surveillance. 
The 1962 Harrison-Kefauver Amendment to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act required approval of the safety and effectiveness of new drugs and reporting of adverse events to the FDA by the applicants.  The regulations for postmarketing reporting of adverse events are stated under 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulation) 314.80 & 81 for Drugs and 600.80 & 81 for Biologics.  This established the basis for the current system, which is a passive surveillance system. This passive surveillance system is one in which FDA receives adverse event reports from manufacturers, health care professionals and patients.  Most of the reports received by FDA are submitted by the manufacturers and fewer are reported directly by consumers and healthcare professionals. 
Monitoring spontaneous reports to identify early safety signals is a critical part of the FDA’s postmarket pharmaceutical product surveillance program to assure the safety of all U.S. marketed products.   Information received through FDA’s passive surveillance system has also been an important source for other FDA centers and federal agencies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, medical community and stakeholders, and national and international health organizations such as the WHO. 
The FDA has been using passive surveillance as the cornerstone for pharmacovigilance for many years.  In order to fully understand the role of passive surveillance in supporting postmarketing safety evaluation throughout the life cycle of a product, FDA is interested in conducting a formal evaluation of its current passive surveillance system. The results of such an evaluation will be used to determine the most appropriate and effective role for passive surveillance within the armamentarium of postmarketing safety assessment tools. 

4. DESCRIPTION
FDA is launching an “Initiative for Maximizing the benefit of Passive Adverse event Collection Throughout a product’s life cycle” (IMPACT) The first step in this public health initiative is to evaluate the impact of collecting and using spontaneous adverse event reports throughout the product life cycle for detection and characterization of drug safety risks supporting regulatory decisions to protect patient safety.

The FDA held a public meeting on January 29, 2008 to obtain broad input from public and private organizations on the scope, goals, and available methodologies to evaluate the utility of spontaneous adverse event (AE) reports submitted to the Agency.  

At this meeting, panel members reiterated that spontaneous reporting provides valuable information for detecting adverse events, particularly those that are rare.  However, under-reporting, the often poor quality of reports, and the lack of systematic feedback to healthcare providers and consumers limit the full utility of the information.  The panel also discussed that now is a timely opportunity to evaluate the impact of passive surveillance on patient safety as the FDA begins to explore and develop new strategies for surveillance.  In addition, FDA presented preliminary work (see docket) that demonstrated safety-related regulatory actions occur throughout the life cycle of new drug products. This research, however, was not able to address the source of data and/or the evidence (e.g. spontaneous reports and clinical trial data) on which the FDA takes regulatory action.  

This preliminary work has begun to provide some answers.  At the same time, much more work needs to be done.  In order to fully understand the role of passive surveillance in supporting postmarketing safety evaluation throughout the life cycle of a product, FDA is interested in conducting a formal evaluation of its current passive surveillance system. The scope of IMPACT includes, but is not limited to, the following research questions:   

1.	What is the value to patient safety of collecting AEs through a passive surveillance system over the marketed life cycle of a product?
a.	How are these data best used in regulatory decision-making?

2.	How can safety issue identification and subsequent regulatory action be characterized in relation to time elapsed following product approval?
a.	Is this influenced by the type of regulatory action and /or the nature of the safety signal?

3.	What is the role of serious and non-serious outcome reports in safety issue identification and subsequent regulatory action?
a.	How does the role of these report types change over the product’s marketed life cycle?

4.	What is the role of reports by health care professional and consumers in safety signal detection?

5.	Are there any types of AE reports that are not helpful to safety signal detection?

6.	What do we know about non-reported AEs or characteristics associated with non-reporting?


Government responsibilities to support this project will be as follows: 

•	FDA will provide project oversight to facilitate information gathering and coordination of interviews with FDA personnel. Any information supplied by the FDA must all be returned to the FDA at the end of the project.

•	In conjunction with PhRMA, FDA will facilitate access to industry records.

The objective of this RFI is to identify appropriate sources capable of performing this evaluation.

http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/07n0480/07n0480.htm
Docket No. 2007N-0480

After considering all input, the FDA will issue an RFP from outside organizations.

5. ORGANIZATIONAL CAPABILITY STATEMENT

<DESC>The Deschutes National Forest anticipates advertising for an Integrated Resource Service Contract (IRSC) for Stewardship activities on the Sisters Ranger District.  The objectives of this contract are to improve forest health, reintroduce fire, increase and improve old forest structure, and improve soil and aquatic conditions.  The resulting contract will be awarded as an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with task orders being placed for the following activities: timber removal, stand cleaning/thinning, mechanical fuels reduction, snag and down wood management, piling of fuels, road maintenance, and sub-soiling.  The estimated volume for timber removal is 16000 CCF and the total value of the contract (product removal + service work) is estimated between $1,000,000 - $5,000,000.  All forest products removed will be scaled and there will be no escalation associated with the products.  The period of performance will be a total of 8 years (5 Year Base + 3 Option Years) with work estimated to commence November 1, 2008.  All Solicitation documents and relative attachments will be available on this website on or around June 13, 2008 with offers due approximately 30 days later.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology, Physical and Chemical Properties Division (PCPD), has a requirement for the extension of the software developed with the last several years and methods for chemical structure identification for the IUPAC International Chemical Identifier and their application to identify compounds in NIST collections where stereochemical or tautomeric information is the name and structure do not precisely match.
The contractor shall gather and provide information to efficiently correct the mismatches/discrepancy problems. Additionally, the Contractor shall develop software to find and organize for correction stereochemical and tautomeric discrepancies between chemical names and chemical structures in the Web-book and in the Library. This pertains specifically to compounds with potential stereochemistry and tautomerism in the NIST Chemistry Web-Book (Web-book, http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/) and in the NIST/NIH/EPA Mass Spectral Library (Library, http://nist.gov/srd/nist1.htm). There are approximately 250,000 different chemical structures among these two collections. 

The Contractor shall provide to NIST annotated lists of discrepancies, techniques of their resolution, and produce software and computer files that can be used directly for automatically or manually verifying and correcting name/structure discrepancies in the NIST Web-Book and the Library using the structure-definitions of the NIST developed InChI code. The Contractor shall grant to NIST unlimited rights to the data.

Because of the technical and scientific nature of this work, to be considered for award, and to perform work under this contract the Key Personnel must meet the minimum requirements:  

(a) a degree in chemistry, (b) at least one year experience in computational chemistry, and (c) at least one year experience in molecular design for organic molecules, and d) proficiency in C or C++ for a Windows environment.

The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), specifications, attachments, amendments, and all questions and answers related to this acquisition shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number SB1341-08-RP-0007.

The RFQ is anticipated for release on or about March 10, 2008, and will only be available via the internet at the above web site.

Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site. Interested parties must respond to the RFP in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract. Telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained. Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to Jo-Lynn.Davis@nist.gov.

<SOLNBR>NIMH-08-DN-00019
<RESPDATE>061808
<CONTACT>Bruce EE Anderson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-2234, Fax 301-443-0501, Email ba9i@nih.gov
<DESC><p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP No. NIMH-08-DN-00019) entitled High-throughput Collection of Gene Expression Data in Developing Rhesus Macaque Brain, on or about April 4, 2008, under full and open competitive procedures. It is anticipated that one contract will be awarded from this solicitation, on or about September 2008, for a period of 2 years with options to extend. NIMH is the lead institute for this Blueprint project (http://www.neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/). NIMH's overall goal for this contract is to develop a publicly available data resource to stimulate research in gene expression during normal brain development. The recent sequencing of the genome of the Rhesus macaque, Macaca mulatta, as well as its broad application as a research model, suggest that this nonhuman primate species would provide the optimal translational bridge between existing gene expression atlases in other species, including mouse, and future efforts in human. This contract will require high throughput collection of gene expression data, and development of a digital brain atlas and associated informatics tools for the analysis of gene expression in specific regions of developing Rhesus macaque brain. More specifically this contract will utilize high throughput, automated histological processing of samples from the developing Rhesus macaque brain, including sectioning, histological staining, and in situ hybridization, resulting in the generation of high resolution gene expression data related to cytoarchitecture which will be represented in a publicly-available digital brain atlas with associated informatics tools, to facilitate data searches and analyses by other investigators. To successfully accomplish the goals of this contract, capable organizations must demonstrate expertise in: 1) neurobiology; 2) both automated and high throughput histological processing, including in situ hybridization; and 3) development of digital atlases of gene expression, associated informatics tools, and web-based dissemination of data. Tissues for analysis under this contract will be obtained via a separate contract with NIMH (to be established), with a facility that has access to well-defined colonies of rhesus macaques, raised in naturalistic settings, where the lineage and hierarchical status of each animal is characterized in detail. This other facility will prepare and transfer the tissues to this contract facility for histological processing and digitization as described above. This contractor will be required to work effectively and closely with the animal facility contractor. RFP No. NIMH-08-DN-00019 will be available on or about April 4, 2008 with the receipt date of proposals on or about June 4, 2008. The RFP will be available solely via the FedBizOpps web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. It will be the offeror?s responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for release of the solicitation, and any possible subsequent amendments, and to download the documents and all attachments. The RFP for this requirement will include the Statement of Work, Deliverables, and Reporting Requirements, the Technical Evaluation Criteria, and proposal preparation instructions. All information required for the submission of an offeror will be contained in the electronic RFP package. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal that will be considered by the NIMH. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. Please contact Bruce Anderson, NIMH Contracting Officer at 301-443-2234, or ba9i@nih.gov, for further information.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK


1.	Title

2.	Background

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the United States government's principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves.  The Department oversees more than 300 programs covering a wide spectrum of activities.

	The HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (OASPA) serves as the HHS Secretary’s principal public affairs policy advisor; to provide centralized professional leadership and continuous monitoring and evaluation of Department-wide policies, procedures and operating practices regarding public affairs activities; and to administer the Freedom of Information Act, Privacy Act and other information access statutes.
	
	The OASPA News Division plans, directs and coordinates the issuance of public information from HHS to the press and broadcast media, including preparing news releases, media advisories, fact sheets, and other news material for the Secretary and other top Department officials.

3.	Purpose 

The purpose of this procurement is to disseminate press releases for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

4.  Scope of Work

With HHS’ expanding media outreach activities, it has become necessary to have access electronically to a large database of media outlets, including journalists, health writers, columnists, trade press, and health care consumers.  HHS programs reach into communities large and small all across America and the Department needs to increase awareness of these services so that more people may benefit. By better targeting our news releases, we will be in a better position to monitor how well we are reaching the people our programs are intended to serve. 

On average the HHS/OASPA/News Division issues approximately 20 news releases, press statements, media advisories, and other time-sensitive media materials each month.  In addition, HHS/OASPA/News Division may issue 10-15 photo releases each year.  The HHS/OASPA/News Division requires the core capability to distribute these materials to a variety of media outlets, including journalists, health writers, columnists, trade press, and health care consumers, and to target special populations and regions of relevance to HHS initiatives and programs, including: 
•	Health and social science research 
•	Preventing disease, including immunization services 
•	Assuring food and drug safety 
•	Medicare (health insurance for elderly and disabled Americans) and Medicaid (health insurance for low-income people) 
•	Health information technology 
•	Financial assistance and services for low-income families 
•	Improving maternal and infant health 
•	Head Start (pre-school education and services) 
•	Faith-based and community initiatives 
•	Preventing child abuse and domestic violence 
•	Substance abuse treatment and prevention 
•	Services for older Americans, including home-delivered meals 
•	Comprehensive health services for Native Americans 
•	Medical preparedness for emergencies, including potential terrorism.


5.	Period of Performance

The period of performance shall be for Six (6) months from effective date of award with the potential of four additional Twelve (12) month option periods for a total of 54 months.


	6.	Tasks

The contractor shall complete the following tasks as identified below:

7.	Schedule of Deliverables

The contractor shall submit all items in the quantities and by the dates indicated to the Project Officer.

All reports, processes, and product deliverables are subject to approval by the Project Officer

If any of the services performed do not conform to contract requirements, the Government may require the Contractor to perform the services again in conformity with contract requirements, for no additional fee.  When the defects in services cannot be corrected by performance, the Government may (1) require the Contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements and (2) reduce any fee payable under the contract to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.

The complete text of Section 508 Final Standards can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/news/508-final.htm.  The contractor shall indicate for each line item in the schedule whether each product or service is compliant or noncompliant with the accessibility standards at 36 CFR 1194. Further, the proposal must indicate where full details of compliance can be found (e.g., vendor's website or other exact location).

k.	Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12

To perform the work specified herein the contractor personnel may  require access to sensitive data, regular access to HHS-controlled facilities and/or access to HHS information systems, the Government may require that this effort entail a sensitivity level 5 (Public Trust) background investigation.*


•	Upon receipt of the Government’s notification of applicable Suitability Background Investigation required, the contractor shall complete and submit required forms within 30 days of the notification.

The Project Officer will submit the list to the HHS Personnel Security  Officer for determination of  the appropriate level of suitability investigations to be performed.               

Contractors should ensure that the employees whose names they submit have a reasonable chance for approval. While delays in performance caused by successful investigations will be the Government's responsibility, delays associated with rejections will be the contractor's responsibility.  

Typically, the Government conducts investigations and checks at no cost to the contractor. Multiple investigations for the same position, whether- resulting from rejections or resulting from an employee's move to another position(s) or company, may at the Contracting Officer's discretion, justify reductions(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation.

* A level 5 is a Public Trust position, which requires a higher level background investigation, including personal interviews, credit checks, etc.  Level 5 positions would require access to IT systems with sensitive data including all of the OIT contractors, and/or access to pre-decisional grant information, etc.

<DESC>1.  SCOPE.  Background:  The mission of the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) is to equip operational commanders with Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) and Government off the Shelf (GOTS) solutions in order to increase effectiveness and reduce risk. The REF receives requirements from operational commanders setting forth necessary capabilities.  The REF is charted by the Senior Army leadership to provide material solutions to meet these requirements in a significantly reduced timeline compared to traditional Department of Defense acquisition procedures.<BR><BR>1.1  Counter-Insurgency Operations (COIN) in Iraq require small contingents of Soldiers to be located at Joint Security Stations (JSS) and Combat Outposts (COPs) away from the main logistical support.  Although mission essential requirements of food water, ammunition, fuel are met by Service,  forces, power is often foraged off the local economy or provided in an ad hoc manner via the local power grid or ad hoc generators of various types cobbled together.  Military Table of  Organization and Equipment (MTOE) Power requirements previously limited to the battalion level of organization are now required at the company level.   Resolution of this issue is essential to the safety of our individual soldiers as well as the security of the outposts. <BR><BR>1.2	 JSS/COP power requirements may be met by providing a clean power converter which is able to simultaneously accept multiple power sources to include power generators, grid electricity, and allow for future wind and solar inputs while conditioning the power to eliminate spikes, and provide limited back up during short periods of interruption due to repair or blackout.   The REF is looking for a low cost single piece of equipment or integrated solution which is able to receive multiple inputs and provide clean stable power as an output.  System must be easy to operate by any Military Operational Specialty (MOS) and grade with minimal user level training.   <BR><BR>1.3  Experience and information obtained from this request for information will be provided to Army Product Manager for Mobile Electric Power.<BR><BR>2.  REQUIREMENTS.  The REF is looking for a single piece of equipment, an intelligent controller, that is able to receive multiple inputs and provide clean stable power as an output.<BR><BR>2.1 The controller shall be capable of providing power output in a form that meets power needs of both host country (220 VAC/50 Hz and standard US (120 VAC/60 Hz) equipment.<BR><BR>2.2  When connected to multiple inputs, the controller output is capable of providing clean, stable, and continuous power at 35-50 kW, with a peak to 75 kW.<BR><BR>2.3  When connected to multiple inputs, the controller serves as the interface between the inputs and outputs for the entire power needs of a security station or combat outpost.<BR><BR>2.4 The controller shall have input and output indicators that assist operators with limited electrical training to understand and mitigate potential power failures for setup and installation.<BR><BR>2.5 The controller shall provide safe and intuitive interfaces for inputs and outputs to setup and install connections within ten (10) minutes by Soldiers with limited electrical expert knowledge.  Plug and play system should consist of color codes or similar user-friendly method for set-up and operation.<BR><BR> 2.6  The controller shall be at a maximum two-man portable with an objective goal of one-man portable.<BR><BR>3.  DELIVERABLES<BR><BR>3.1  Specific information on industry capability to produce a clean power controller that can meet the requirements identified in para 2 above.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Reference the Joint Project Manager Nuclear Biological Chemical Contamination Avoidance (JPM-NBCCA) APBI that was conducted on April 14, 2008, at the RDECOM Conference Center Auditorium,Edgewood Area,Aberdeen Proving Ground for the CBDEWS. Below are the Questions submitted at the APBI and their answers. Due to limitation maximum character count allowed, Questions 1 thru 64 are included in this posting as PART I and Questions 65 thru 87 have been posted in separate posting as PART II. The attendee list will not be posted. Solicitation number W911SR-08-R-8999 is assigned for reference and information purposes only and is not to be construed as a definite requirement or solicitation document.The attendee list will not be posted.<BR>PART I QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<BR>  -Q-- 1.What are the requirements?  Range, sensitivity, false alarms, size, power, weight, cosT. ANSWER-Requirements are currently being developed by the Joint Requirement Office (JRO), Chem School, and Joint Project Manager (JPM).<BR>  -Q-- 2.What will be your success criteria for 2008 and beyond?ANSWER-Success criteria for 2008 will be to prove out the integration concept, refine system integration and define achievable goals for 2009.<BR>  -Q-- 3.What are the System of System (SOS) requirements and when will they be published? ANSWER-Requirements are currently being developed by the JRO, Chem School and JPM.  Once requirements have been finalized, The JPM will publish the requirements. The Chemical Biological Distributed Early Warning System (CBDEWS) program will start with a static solution first and then integrated into Future Combat Systems (FCS), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Joint NBC Reconnassiance System (JNBCRS), and Stryker NBC Reconnaissance (NBCRV).<BR>  -Q-- 4. When will the Capability Development Document (CDD)/ Capability Production Document (CPD) be published for CBDEWS? ANSWER-To Be Determined - JPM Nuclear, Biological, Chemical Contamination Avoidance (NBC CA) is requesting from the JRO: Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) - 2QFY09, CDD - 4QFY09<BR>  -Q-- 5. What is the target date to publish a capabilities document? ANSWER-See answer to question number four.<BR>  -Q-- 6. Have you developed a cost vs. capability curve?  How much additional capability would a tech need to provide for inclusion? ANSWER-No, capabilities documents still need to be completed (4QFY09).  Once capabilities documents are completed, they will be used to develop a capabilities curve.  <BR>  -Q-- 7. Is industry going to be able to provide input to the capabilities document (i.e., state of the art and what is possible) ANSWER-Industry can: 1) Keep the CBDEWS program informed of your efforts/successes/challenges.  2) Take advantage of field demonstrations.  Bring your equipment (at contractors own cost) and share the results with CBDEWS program; so we are aware of what technology is available.<BR>  -Q-- 8. What are the plans for Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs), trade studies, and Modeling and Simulation (M&S) to define SOS requirements and architectures?ANSWER-The CBDEWS program will perform an AoAs before production efforts.  However, at this point in the program, the primary focus is requirements development. A technology included in one test/demonstration may not be included in future test/demonstration events.  New technologies may be identified and inserted into the program as technologies mature.<BR>  -Q-- 9. Will point detectors include a particulate detection requirement? ANSWER-Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD) Increment 1 requirements are published and Increment 2 requirements are currently being developed/finalized.  The JPM is interested if a contractor has a technology that can exceed the JCAD requirements. <BR>  -Q-- 10. Please comment:  When requirements creep hits, will this solution set collapse?  Consider:  200+ Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICS), Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMS)?  Warfare agent, JPM Guardian needs?  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) needs?  Source specific needs? ANSWER-The CBDEWS program is currently managing requirements development to avoid issues which have occurred in the past.  In addition, the solution set is intended as an open architecture to permit flexibility to support emerging requirements.<BR>  -Q-- 11. What are the Information Assurance (IA) dictates that the CBDEWS program must follow? ANSWER-The CBDEWS program is under the same information assurance guidance as any other program.  The program will follow the Department of Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) to obtain authority to operate.<BR>  -Q-- 12. Will CBDEWS be required to meet JPM Guardian Individual Protection Program (IPP) requirements?  Or REPLACE the existing Guardian programs? ANSWER-The CBDEWS program is partnering with JPM Guardian and JPM Information Systems (IS) to ensure that the solution set is consistent with their systems as well.<BR>  -Q-- 13. Are you planning on a single processor for computing or will you plan for distributed computing? ANSWER-The JPM NBC CA is working with current partners to define the demonstration architecture rather than dictate a solution.  This will guide future architectural efforts with future partners as well.<BR>  -Q-- 14. Single point of data collection has traffic pitfalls and requires prioritization as well as very fast IO.  Tactical Automated Security System (TASS) will handle the Command and Control (C2) but where will the priority list come from? ANSWER- Rule sets and prioritization will be developed to support the program.  The specific system has not been defined at present.<BR>  -Q-- 15. How much autonomous action do you desire?  Where must there be a man in the loop? ANSWER-Autonomy is the desired solution with an override capability when desired.  Rules and prioritization must be developed as part of the program to support autonomous actions and when actions require human intervention.<BR>  -Q-- 16.Is there any initiative to re-evaluate the list of chem, bio & RAD threat agents and re-classify the credibility of actual threats? ANSWER- The JPM NBC CA is currently looking at the threat list to understand scope and priority in specific areas of the world.  JPEO-CBD in conjunction with the Stakeholders are constantly reevaluating the Threats.<BR>  -Q-- 17.When can I access recently published Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) standard interface? ANSWER-Information on the CBRN standard interface can be found on the JPEO website.  http://www.jpeocbd.osd.mil/page_manager.asp?pg=4&sub=2  <BR>  -Q-- 18.Wide Ranging Threat Potential slide lists Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical.  How important is Nuclear?  It wasn't mentioned in talks much. ANSWER-The nuclear threat is important.  However, the current priority is weighted heavily in favor of chemical and biological standoff detection.  The architecture will be developed such that additions can be made to support the nuclear requirements in the future.<BR>  -Q-- 19. How does industry get sensors included in tech demo Sep 08?
