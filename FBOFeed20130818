<CONTACT>Daniel Gregory Laidlaw Feldman, Phone 301-827-0359, Email daniel.g.feldman@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE ORDER
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a sole source order to IonSense, Inc. for Direct Analysis in Real Time (DART) Ionization Source equipment (and associated services) that can be coupled to mass spectrometers, including mounting apparati for both Agilent and Thermo Fisher Scientific mass spectrometers, a three-dimensional movable platform for variable sampling, a tablet platform for automated analysis of pharmaceuticals, pumps to support interfaces, wireless communication capabilities, and an infusion module to introduce desired dopants into the mass spectrometers as well as warranty, training of operation, and annual preventive maintenance on the DART Ionization Source equipment. This action is anticipated to be a firm-fixed-price order utilizing Federal Acquisition (FAR) Parts 12 and 13 with an expected award on or about on September 9, 2013.</p>
<p>IonSense is the only organization capable of providing this equipment and associated accessories because of patent rights on the DART Ionization Source. Due to patent protections, IonSense is the only company permitted to sell DART Ionization Source equipment independent of a mass spectrometer. With this requirement, the FDA needs a DART Ionization Source equipment independent of a mass spectrometer and not a combination DART-mass spectrometer system.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a response identifying their interest and capability to perform this requirement, which will be considered by the FDA. Responses must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the above requirement. The FDA will normally consider responses solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The proposed procurement is for equipment and associated services which the FDA intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.</p>
<p>ALL RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE OF INTENT SHALL BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN 1:00 PM EASTERN TIME ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2013 VIA EMAIL TO DAN FELDMAN AT DANIEL.G.FELDMAN@FDA.HHS.GOV.</p>

<p>(end of provision)</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541330 with a small business size standard of $14.0M. This requirement is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>NIST has a requirement for a contractor to provide optical metrology support.</p>
<p><br />Background</p>
<p>Optical methods are used widely in semiconductor manufacturing for the measurement of feature dimensions known as critical dimensions (CD) and for defect inspection. Measurement tolerances continue to be reduced and improved measurement uncertainty is required. NIST is developing improved optical modeling methods and hardware techniques to accomplish this. For quantitative analysis, such as for metrology applications, it is essential to have accurate modeling capabilities and high speed measurement algorithms.</p>
<p>NIST has a requirement for the development and operation of new optical modeling code that includes front and back end Fourier capability using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) approach and rigorous coupled wave (RCW) approach. This involves code development for the electromagnetic scattering components and the Fourier optical illumination and imaging components through enhancement of Fourier based normalization of the illumination and scattered fields. Simulations using three dimensional models and comparison with the experiments are an essential part of optical defect and critical dimension (CD) metrology. Accurate numerical simulations are an essential requirement for the analysis of experimental results for dimensional measurements. Comparison of FDTD, RCW, and integral equation methods for two and three dimensional models must be carried out to ensure accurate modeling of inherently three dimensional features.</p>
<p>The requirement is also for the development of new optical techniques for next generation defect metrology and inspection that use the spatial frequency components of the sample and optical fields. This will include methods that use coherent illumination and interference imaging. The data acquisition and modeling involves spatial frequency analysis and optimization of the illumination and collection optics. This requirement includes rigorous evaluation of scattered light from defects acquired using a modified bright field optical microscope. Theoretical simulations are used to demonstrate observable signatures for defects for logic cells and intentional defect arrays using targets based on highly directional lithography procedures. Advancing these methods using interference microscopy includes using complex reference fields encoded with spatial frequency information. The contractor will operate and develop simulation code running on a parallel multi core processor to evaluate these methods for scatterfield designs and interference microscope designs.</p>
<p>This requirement also involves complex statistical methods to combine and optimize various measurement strategies use in optical metrology. Statistical code will be developed to optimize optical microscope and modeling performance at 193 nm and longer wavelengths. Both coherent and incoherent illumination methods need to be evaluated using algorithms for the 193 nm optical instrument. This will include quantitative analysis of 193 nm or similar scatterfield microscope illumination for spatial frequency controlled or interferometric microscopy.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology has a requirement for Optical Metrology Support</p>
<p>All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Scientific Services: Optical Metrology Support, in accordance with the Statement of Work, attached.</p>

<p>Line Item 0001. Services, non-personal, to develop ocean literacy programs by working with local partners through workshops, exhibits, outreach programs, films, and by developing programs and resources for educators, docents and teachers.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND<br />Cordell Bank is an offshore seamount located on the edge of the continental shelf about 25 nautical miles west of the Pt. Reyes lighthouse in California. The Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary (CBNMS) was established in 1989 to protect and preserve the extraordinary marine ecosystem surrounding the Cordell Bank. Surrounded by soft sediments of the continental shelf seafloor, Cordell Bank emerges with a rocky habitat, providing home to colorful and abundant invertebrates, algae, and fishes. The productive waters attract migratory seabirds and marine mammals from all around the Pacific Ocean to feed in this dynamic ecosystem.</p>
<p>B. OVERVIEW <br />The sanctuary works to develop ocean literacy programs by working with local partners. The sanctuary achieves this goal through workshops, exhibits, outreach programs, films, and by developing programs and resources for educators, docents and teachers.</p>
<p>In addition, the education staff at CBNMS works closely with the research team to communicate research results. Our primary research and monitoring program investigates the relationship between oceanographic conditions and biological productivity in the sanctuary. Sanctuary staff and partners monitor changes in ocean production and the distribution and abundance of top level predators like seabirds, whales and turtles within and between years. The Applied California Current Ecosystem Studies (ACCESS) program has monitored sanctuary conditions for ten years. Educators work directly with the ACCESS team to translate the research to multiple audiences including media, social media, educators, and ocean interested public and other interested audiences.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK:<br />Task A. Education and Outreach Services to fulfill the following requirements<br />1. Working collaboratively with NOAA staff, contractor will design programs and activities for teachers, targeting K-12, using coastal and ocean sciences to increase literacy and awareness of the oceans and national marine sanctuaries. Work includes developing webinar series for professional development for teachers on specific ocean and/or climate topics and developing a coastal ecology field workshop series (3 workshops) geared to increase teachers' knowledge of coastal ecology, science, threats, and conservation efforts. Contractor will work with sanctuary partners, create series, advertise, recruit, manage all behind the scenes logistics, host the series, and conduct pre and post evaluation with each program.</p>
<p>2. Working collaboratively with NOAA staff, design tailored training materials for museum docents to assist docents in being able to deliver education programs, tours, and demonstrations at the newly opened and permanent exhibit on Cordell Bank NMS. Contractor will work with docents and museum staff to create appropriate training materials covering topics such as: history of Cordell Bank, oceanography of the Cordell Bank region (upwelling), underwater/Bank ecology, albatross migrations/lifecycle/threats, sanctuary conservation issues, and general sanctuary resource protection and Office of National Marine Sanctuary messages.</p>
<p>3. Work with sanctuary education coordinator to develop a K-5 school sanctuary program to be delivered in elementary schools by a sanctuary educator/volunteer/intern. Contractor will conduct needs assessment with schools in Sonoma and northern Marin Counties and identify best topics that are relevant to the sanctuary and to K-5 curriculum topics of interest. Contractor will create and pilot program in 5 schools and create evaluation strategy.</p>
<p>4. Working collaboratively with NOAA staff, conduct training for teachers about the Winged Ambassadors curriculum, and conduct formal evaluation of the curriculum and training program. Update the curriculum based on feedback from teachers and evaluation. Winged Ambassadors educational resource that consists of 5 lesson plans that use the albatross as an "ambassador" species. It features data collected from researchers conducting work in Cordell Bank NMS (under permit) and current ocean conservation issues to increase ocean literacy and awareness about sanctuary species and conservation.</p>
<p>Task B. Sample analysis: <br />As part of the ACCESS program, net tows are done to quantify the distribution of plankton. Zooplankton samples will be analyzed for species and life stage data so the Sanctuaries can better understand the keystone populations. The contractor will complete full analysis of plankton samples collected during monitoring cruises. Specimens will be identified to the lowest possible taxon. As appropriate, an aliquot of each sample will be analyzed. Taxa will be sorted with specific attention paid to euphausiids (krill), copepods, decapods, mysids, and fish. For each sample, measurements of all taxa will be made including, mean length, maximum length, life stage, sex, percentage of the total sample, and as appropriate, developmental stage. If samples need to be split, clear documentation will be provided.</p>
<p>1. Split the sample to a reasonable subsample (or aliquot) to allow for easier sorting to find the taxa of interest: euphausiids (krill), decapods, copepods, mysids, and fish.</p>
<p>2. Identify (to species and life stage), enumerate, measure and weigh the euphausiids in the sample.</p>
<p>3. Identify (to species and life stage, if possible), enumerate, measure and weigh the decapods and copepods in the sample.</p>
<p>4. Enumerate, measure and weigh the mysids and fish in the sample.</p>
<p>5. Store contents of the subsample in different vials, and properly label each vial with the appropriate information.</p>
<p>6. Record all data on NOAA supplied data-sheets. All data sheets will be delivered to the sanctuary upon completion of the analysis.</p>

For Postal Delivery: NAVAL FACILITIES ENGINEERING COMMAND MARIANAS, ATTENTION: DANTE P. SERNEO, PSC 455, BOX 195 FPO, AP 96540-2937. ELECTRONIC SUBMITTALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>Offerors must submit, as part of their proposal, the following: (1) Completed Price Proposal/Schedule (2) Completed copies of FAR 52.212-3, as well as DFARS 252.212-7000 or Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) record. ORCA is located at https://orca.bpn.gov. The provisions and clauses can be found at FAR website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil and DFARS website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vfdfara.htm (3) Exhibit 5, Completed Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ).</p>
<p>BASIS OF EVALUATION</p>
<p>1. The Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration for award any or all offers at any time prior to award of the contract; to negotiate with offerors in the competitive range; and to award the contract to the offeror submitting the lowest price technically acceptable offer.</p>
<p>2. As stated in the solicitation, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. In addition, if the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.<br /><br />3. The LPTA process is selected as appropriate for this acquisition because the best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>4. An overall non-price factors rating must be at least "ACCEPTABLE" in order to be eligible for award. An "UNACCEPTABLE" rating in any factor results in the overall non-price factors proposal being rated "UNACCEPTABLE" unless corrected through discussions. An overall non-price factors rating of "UNACCEPTABLE" makes a proposal ineligible for award.</p>
<p>B. SAFETY EVALUATION</p>
<p>1. Per NFAS 15.304(b), solicitations utilizing source selection procedures for procurements within the 50 United States and the District of Columbia shall contain a standard "Safety" technical evaluation factor. This factor shall be included as a stand-alone evaluation factor and not as a sub-factor or an element of the Past Performance evaluation factor. This action will result in the selection of contractors that have consistently demonstrated a commitment to safety and the ability to properly manage and implement safety procedures for themselves and all tiers of subcontractors under their purview.</p>
<p>2. The safety evaluation has three elements: Experience Modification Rate (EMR), Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) Days Away from Work, Job Restriction, or Transfer (DART), and Technical Approach to Safety.</p>
<p>3. The three elements of safety, as listed above, are not sub-factors. The evaluators should collectively consider all elements of safety when assigning an overall adjectival rating for this factor. The SSEB will need to make a qualitative determination of the rating for this factor, taking into account the risk ratings for EMR and DART and the subjective evaluation of the narrative.</p>
<p>4. Evaluators will not average the rating from the three years for the EMR and the DART.</p>
<p>4. The following should be utilized by evaluators as a general guideline to evaluate the <br />EMR and DART rates:</p>
<p>Risk EMR<br />Very Low Risk Less than 0.6<br />Low Risk From 0.6 to less than 0.8<br />Moderate Risk From 0.8 to 1.0<br />High Risk Greater than1.0 to 1.1<br />Extremely High Risk Greater than 1.1</p>
<p>Risk DART Rate <br />Very Low Risk Less Than 1.0 <br />Low Risk From 1.0 to 1.99 <br />Moderate Risk From 2.0 to 2.99 <br />High Risk From 3.0 to 4.0 <br />Extremely High Risk Greater than 4.0</p>
<p><br />C. ADJECTIVAL RATINGS/DESCRIPTIONS</p>
<p>Each offeror's technical factors and past performance will be evaluated separately. Upon the conclusion of the evaluation of the technical factors an overall non-price factors rating of Acceptable (A) or Unacceptable (U) will be assigned to each offeror's non-price factors proposal.</p>
<p>1. The following adjectival ratings and rating descriptions will be used to assign a rating to each technical factor. Use upper case letter ratings for major technical factor ratings. The addition of plus (+) or minus (-) to an adjective rating is not allowed.</p>
<p>Table A-1. Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable (A) Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Unacceptable (U) Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br /><br />The weaknesses and/or deficiencies (as defined below) of each proposal for each non-price evaluation factor which influenced the assigned adjectival rating shall be identified.<br /><br />Definitions <br />Weakness A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. <br />Significant Weakness A flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.<br />Deficiency A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.</p>
<p>2. PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</p>
<p>Past Performance shall be evaluated when using the LPTA process, unless waived by the PCO in accordance with FAR 15.101-2(b). Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis using the ratings in the following table:</p>
<p>Table A-2. Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable (A) Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Unacceptable (U) Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>(a) Aspects of Past Performance Evaluation. The past performance evaluation results is an assessment of the offeror's probability of meeting the minimum past performance solicitation requirements. This assessment is based on the offeror's record of relevant and recent past performance information that pertain to the products and/or services outlined in the solicitation requirements. There are two aspects of the past performance evaluation.</p>
<p>(1) The first is to evaluate whether the offeror's present/past performance is relevant or not relevant to the effort to be acquired. The criteria to establish what is relevant is unique to each LPTA source selection. For this solicitation, The Offeror's past performance will be evaluated based upon client satisfaction on recent relevant cell phone and black berry services within the last five (5) years. Client satisfaction will be measured based upon quality of work, effectiveness of management, timely completion of work, and compliance with safety standards. Further, as an integral part of client satisfaction, the Offeror's termination for default history and safety record will also be evaluated.</p>
<p>(2) The second aspect of the past performance evaluation is to determine how well the contractor performed on the contracts. The past performance evaluation performed in support of a current source selection does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on past contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed those past contracts.</p>
<p>(b) SSEB members will review past performance information to determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to the performance confidence assessment.</p>
<p><br />D. EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>1. The solicitation requires the evaluation of price and the following non-price factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Offeror Experience <br />Factor 2 - Past Performance<br />Factor 3 - Safety</p>
<p>The distinction between Offeor Experience and Past Performance is Offeror Experience pertains to the types of work and volume of work completed by a contractor that are comparable to the types of work covered by this requirement, in terms of size, scope, and complexity. Past performance relates to how well a contractor has performed. <br /><br />2. Basis of Evaluation and Submittal Requirements for Each Factor.</p>
<p>The relative order of importance of the technical evaluation factors are considered of equal weight, and when combined, are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>a. Price</p>
<p>(1) Solicitation Submittal Requirements: The offeror shall submit the following in the order shown below in a sealed envelope. Envelope is to be clearly marked in the bottom right corner as follows:</p>
<p>Offeror's Name<br />PRICE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED UNDER RFP N40192-13-R-8008<br />DO NOT OPEN IN MAILROOM</p>
<p>(i) Standard Form (SF) 33 (Solicitation, Offer, and Award) - Offeror is to complete blocks 15 through 18</p>
<p>(ii) Exhibits A thru E from Section J of the solicitation - Offeror is to complete all ELIN unit pricing for each contract period, which will become the rates effective at contract award</p>
<p>(iii) Representations and Certifications from Section K of the solicitation -Offeror is to complete Section K and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA)</p>
<p>(iv) Joint Venture Agreement (if applicable)</p>
<p>(2) Basis of Evaluation: Prices will be evaluated for reasonableness based on:<br />(1) Comparison of proposed prices with other offers received in response to the solicitation; and (2) Comparison with the Independent Government Estimate. Unrealistically low (or high) proposed prices or prices unbalanced between the various option periods, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the Offeror does not understand the requirement, or has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>
<p>b. Technical Factors:</p>
<p>(1) FACTOR 1, OFFEROR EXPERIENCE</p>
<p>(i) Solicitation Submittal Requirements: The Offeror shall submit the following under Tab "1" of their proposal:</p>
<p>(1) Use format in Attachment 2 (Offeror Experience Project Data Sheet) to submit projects for evaluation under experience. Submit Attachment 2 under Tab "1" of the proposal.</p>
<p>(2) Submit projects for Black Berry and Cell Phone Wireless services.</p>
<p>(3) Submit projects completed or substantially completed (80% complete) within five-year period. The five-year period is calculated by counting back five years from the date set for the receipt of proposals in the RFP.</p>
<p>(4) Submit a maximum of five (5) projects for the Offeror.</p>
<p>(5) Submit evidence of a binding teaming agreement or other contractual agreement which creates legal responsibility on the part of the subcontractors, as applicable. Proposals that fail to use format in Attachment 2 may be rated lower. All projects submitted which are outside the five-year period or above the maximum number allowed for consideration will be removed and discarded prior to evaluation. All projects submitted which are not relevant in scope will be removed and discarded prior to evaluation. Offerors who submit relevant projects for a subsidiary, satellite office, parent company, or predecessor company must fully explain how this office will participate in this contract. If it is not clear how this office will participate in this contract, the project will be removed and discarded prior to evaluation.</p>
<p>(ii) Basis of Evaluation: The Offeror's experience will be evaluated based upon demonstrated Black Berry and Cell Phone Wireless services experience similar in scope, size, type, and complexity to the work in the RFP.</p>
<p>(2) FACTOR 2, PAST PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>(i) Solicitation Submittal Requirements: The Offeror shall submit the following under Tab "2" of their proposal:</p>
<p>(1) Submit one of the following for each of the projects submitted under Factor 1 - Offeror Experience:</p>
<p>a. A Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ), a Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) for Services, a Construction Contractor Appraisal Support System (CCASS) Performance Evaluation - Construction Contract, or an Architect- Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) Performance Evaluation.</p>
<p>b. If a commercial project, submit a PPQ.</p>
<p>c. If a Government project, submit a copy of a CPAR, CCASS, or ACASS. The Government will not evaluate any PPQ submitted for a Government project if an official CPAR, CCASS or ACASS evaluation exists in the Government database.</p>
<p>d. An interim CPAR, CCASS, ACASS or PPQ will be accepted for evaluation if an Offeror submits projects which are at least 80%,but less than 100% complete.</p>
<p>(2) If you are submitting a project that your firm performed as a subcontractor, the prime contractor may be cited as the client POC.</p>
<p>(3) Submit projects completed or substantially completed (at least 80%) within five-year period. The five-year period is calculated by counting back five years from the date set for the receipt of proposals in the RFP.</p>
<p>(4) Submit a maximum of five (5) projects for the Offeror.</p>
<p>(2) Basis of Evaluation: The Offeror's past performance will be evaluated based upon client satisfaction on recent relevant cell phone and black berry wireless services within the last five (5) years. Client satisfaction will be measured based upon quality of work, effectiveness of management, timely completion of work, and compliance with safety standards. Further, as an integral part of client satisfaction, the Offeror's termination for default history and safety record will also be evaluated. The Government's sources of information for evaluating past performance may include, but are not limited to, any and all information provided by the contractor, inquiries of owner representative(s), any other known sources not provided by the Offeror, Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the Offeror.</p>
<p>(3) FACTOR 3, SAFETY:</p>
<p>(i) Solicitation Submittal Requirements: The Offeror shall submit the following information: (For a partnership or joint venture, the following submittal requirements are required for each contractor who is part of the partnership or joint venture; however, only one safety narrative is required. EMR and DART Rates shall not be submitted for subcontractors.)<br />(1) Experience Modification Rate (EMR): For the three previous complete calendar years, 2010, 2011 and 2012, submit your EMR (which compares your company's annual losses in insurance claims against its policy premiums over a three year period). If you have no EMR, affirmatively state so, and explain why. Any extenuating circumstances that affected the EMR and upward or downward trends should be addressed as part of this element. Lower EMRs will be given greater weight in the evaluation.</p>
<p>(2) OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rate: For the three previous complete calendar years 2010, 2011 and 2012, submit your OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rate, as defined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration. If you cannot submit an OSHA DART Rate, affirmatively state so, and explain why. Any extenuating circumstances that affected the OSHA DART Rate data and upward or downward trends should be addressed as part of this element. Lower OSHA DART Rates will be given greater weight in the evaluation. <br /><br />(3) Technical Approach for Safety: Describe the plan that the Offeror will implement to evaluate safety performance of potential subcontractors, as a part of the selection process for all levels of subcontractors. Also, describe any innovative methods that the Offeror will employ to ensure and monitor safe work practices at all subcontractor levels. The Safety Narrative shall be limited to two pages.</p>
<p>(ii) Basis of Evaluation: The Government is seeking to determine that the Offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to safety and that the Offeror plans to properly manage and implement safety procedures for itself and its subcontractors. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's overall safety record, the Offeror's plan to select and monitor subcontractors, any and innovative safety methods that the Offeror plans to implement for this procurement. The Government's sources of information for evaluating safety may include, but are not limited to, OSHA, NAVFAC's Facility Accident and Incident Reporting (FAIR) database, and other related databases. While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete safety information regarding these submittal requirements rests with the Offeror. The evaluation will collectively consider the following:</p>
<p>- Experience Modification Rate (EMR) <br />- OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rate<br />- Offeror Technical Approach to Safety<br />- Other sources of information available to the Government</p>
<p>(1) Experience Modification Rate (EMR): The Government will evaluate the EMR to determine if the Offeror has demonstrated a history of safe work practices taking into account any upward or downward trends and extenuating circumstances that impact the rating. Lower EMRs will be given greater weight in the evaluation. <br /><br />(2) OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rate: The Government will evaluate the OSHA DART Rate to determine if the Offeror has demonstrated a history of safe work practices taking into account any upward or downward trends and extenuating circumstances that impact the rates. Lower OSHA DART Rates will be given greater weight in the evaluation. <br />(3) Technical Approach to Safety: The Government will evaluate the narrative to determine the degree to which subcontractor safety performance will be considered in the selection of all levels of subcontractors on the upcoming project. The Government will also evaluate the narrative to determine the degree to which innovations are being proposed that may enhance safety on this procurement. Those Offerors whose plan demonstrates a commitment to hire subcontractors with a culture of safety and who propose innovative methods to enhance a safe working environment may be given greater weight in the evaluation.</p>

<p>All responsible contractors are encouraged to submit an offer in response to this solicitation. Proposals must be received by this office no later than 12:30 p.m. (Chamorro Standard Time) on Monday, 17 September 2013. Offerors shall submit the proposal to the following address: For Hand Delivery: NAVAL FACILITIES ENGINEERING COMMAND MARIANAS, BLDG 103, NAVAL STATION, GUAM, 1ST floor. You will need to call a Government POC upon arrival to the building to gain access. Your Government POC is Patrick Quitugua, Contract Specialist, and he can be reached at (671) 333-4119 or Jeno Aguon, Contract Specialist Intern, and he can be reached at (671) 339-2127. For Postal Delivery: NAVAL FACILITIES ENGINEERING COMMAND MARIANAS, ATTENTION: DANTE P. SERNEO, PSC 455, BOX 195 FPO, AP 96540-2937. ELECTRONIC SUBMITTALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>Offerors must submit, as part of their proposal, the following: (1) Completed Price Proposal/Schedule (2) Completed copies of FAR 52.212-3, as well as DFARS 252.212-7000 or Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) record. ORCA is located at https://orca.bpn.gov. The provisions and clauses can be found at FAR website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil and DFARS website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vfdfara.htm (3) Exhibit 5, Completed Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ).</p>
<p>BASIS OF EVALUATION</p>
<p>1. The Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration for award any or all offers at any time prior to award of the contract; to negotiate with offerors in the competitive range; and to award the contract to the offeror submitting the lowest price technically acceptable offer.</p>
<p>2. As stated in the solicitation, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. In addition, if the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.<br /><br />3. The LPTA process is selected as appropriate for this acquisition because the best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>4. An overall non-price factors rating must be at least "ACCEPTABLE" in order to be eligible for award. An "UNACCEPTABLE" rating in any factor results in the overall non-price factors proposal being rated "UNACCEPTABLE" unless corrected through discussions. An overall non-price factors rating of "UNACCEPTABLE" makes a proposal ineligible for award.</p>
<p>B. SAFETY EVALUATION</p>
<p>1. Per NFAS 15.304(b), solicitations utilizing source selection procedures for procurements within the 50 United States and the District of Columbia shall contain a standard "Safety" technical evaluation factor. This factor shall be included as a stand-alone evaluation factor and not as a sub-factor or an element of the Past Performance evaluation factor. This action will result in the selection of contractors that have consistently demonstrated a commitment to safety and the ability to properly manage and implement safety procedures for themselves and all tiers of subcontractors under their purview.</p>
<p>2. The safety evaluation has three elements: Experience Modification Rate (EMR), Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) Days Away from Work, Job Restriction, or Transfer (DART), and Technical Approach to Safety.</p>
<p>3. The three elements of safety, as listed above, are not sub-factors. The evaluators should collectively consider all elements of safety when assigning an overall adjectival rating for this factor. The SSEB will need to make a qualitative determination of the rating for this factor, taking into account the risk ratings for EMR and DART and the subjective evaluation of the narrative.</p>
<p>4. Evaluators will not average the rating from the three years for the EMR and the DART.</p>
<p>4. The following should be utilized by evaluators as a general guideline to evaluate the <br />EMR and DART rates:</p>
<p>Risk EMR<br />Very Low Risk Less than 0.6<br />Low Risk From 0.6 to less than 0.8<br />Moderate Risk From 0.8 to 1.0<br />High Risk Greater than1.0 to 1.1<br />Extremely High Risk Greater than 1.1</p>
<p>Risk DART Rate <br />Very Low Risk Less Than 1.0 <br />Low Risk From 1.0 to 1.99 <br />Moderate Risk From 2.0 to 2.99 <br />High Risk From 3.0 to 4.0 <br />Extremely High Risk Greater than 4.0</p>
<p><br />C. ADJECTIVAL RATINGS/DESCRIPTIONS</p>
<p>Each offeror's technical factors and past performance will be evaluated separately. Upon the conclusion of the evaluation of the technical factors an overall non-price factors rating of Acceptable (A) or Unacceptable (U) will be assigned to each offeror's non-price factors proposal.</p>
<p>1. The following adjectival ratings and rating descriptions will be used to assign a rating to each technical factor. Use upper case letter ratings for major technical factor ratings. The addition of plus (+) or minus (-) to an adjective rating is not allowed.</p>
<p>Table A-1. Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable (A) Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Unacceptable (U) Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br /><br />The weaknesses and/or deficiencies (as defined below) of each proposal for each non-price evaluation factor which influenced the assigned adjectival rating shall be identified.<br /><br />Definitions <br />Weakness A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance. <br />Significant Weakness A flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.<br />Deficiency A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.</p>
<p>2. PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION</p>
<p>Past Performance shall be evaluated when using the LPTA process, unless waived by the PCO in accordance with FAR 15.101-2(b). Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis using the ratings in the following table:</p>
<p>Table A-2. Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable (A) Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Unacceptable (U) Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>(a) Aspects of Past Performance Evaluation. The past performance evaluation results is an assessment of the offeror's probability of meeting the minimum past performance solicitation requirements. This assessment is based on the offeror's record of relevant and recent past performance information that pertain to the products and/or services outlined in the solicitation requirements. There are two aspects of the past performance evaluation.</p>
<p>(1) The first is to evaluate whether the offeror's present/past performance is relevant or not relevant to the effort to be acquired. The criteria to establish what is relevant is unique to each LPTA source selection. For this solicitation, The Offeror's past performance will be evaluated based upon client satisfaction on recent relevant cell phone and black berry services within the last five (5) years. Client satisfaction will be measured based upon quality of work, effectiveness of management, timely completion of work, and compliance with safety standards. Further, as an integral part of client satisfaction, the Offeror's termination for default history and safety record will also be evaluated.</p>
<p>(2) The second aspect of the past performance evaluation is to determine how well the contractor performed on the contracts. The past performance evaluation performed in support of a current source selection does not establish, create, or change the existing record and history of the offeror's past performance on past contracts; rather, the past performance evaluation process gathers information from customers on how well the offeror performed those past contracts.</p>
<p>(b) SSEB members will review past performance information to determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to the performance confidence assessment.</p>
<p><br />D. EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>1. The solicitation requires the evaluation of price and the following non-price factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Offeror Experience <br />Factor 2 - Past Performance<br />Factor 3 - Safety</p>
<p>The distinction between Offeror Experience and Past Performance is Offeror experience pertains to the types of work and volume of work completed by a contractor that are comparable to the types of work covered by this requirement, in terms of size, scope, and complexity. Past performance relates to how well a contractor has performed. <br /><br />2. Basis of Evaluation and Submittal Requirements for Each Factor.</p>
<p>The relative order of importance of the technical evaluation factors are considered of equal weight, and when combined, are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>a. Price</p>
<p>(1) Solicitation Submittal Requirements: The offeror shall submit the following in the order shown below in a sealed envelope. Envelope is to be clearly marked in the bottom right corner as follows:</p>
<p>Offeror's Name<br />PRICE PROPOSAL SUBMITTED UNDER RFP N40192-13-R-8009<br />DO NOT OPEN IN MAILROOM</p>
<p>(i) Standard Form (SF) 33 (Solicitation, Offer, and Award) - Offeror is to complete blocks 15 through 18</p>
<p>(ii) Exhibits A thru E from Section J of the solicitation - Offeror is to complete all ELIN unit pricing for each contract period, which will become the rates effective at contract award</p>
<p>(iii) Representations and Certifications from Section K of the solicitation -Offeror is to complete Section K and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA)</p>
<p>(iv) Joint Venture Agreement (if applicable)</p>
<p>(2) Basis of Evaluation: Prices will be evaluated for reasonableness based on:<br />(1) Comparison of proposed prices with other offers received in response to the solicitation; and <br />(2) Comparison with the Independent Government Estimate. Unrealistically low (or high) proposed prices or prices unbalanced between the various option periods, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the Offeror does not understand the requirement, or has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>
<p>b. Technical Factors:</p>
<p>(1) FACTOR 1, OFFEROR EXPERIENCE</p>
<p>(i) Solicitation Submittal Requirements: The Offeror shall submit the following under Tab "1" of their proposal:</p>
<p>(1) Use format in Attachment 2 (Offeror Experience Project Data Sheet) to submit projects for evaluation under experience. Submit Attachment 2 under Tab "1" of the proposal.</p>
<p>(2) Submit projects for Push to Talk Wireless services.</p>
<p>(3) Submit projects completed or substantially (80% completed) within five-year period. The five-year period is calculated by counting back five years from the date set for the receipt of proposals in the RFP.</p>
<p>(4) Submit a maximum of five (5) projects for the Offeror.</p>
<p>(5) Submit evidence of a binding teaming agreement or other contractual agreement which creates legal responsibility on the part of the subcontractors, as applicable. Proposals that fail to use format in Attachment 2 may be rated lower. All projects submitted which are outside the five-year period or above the maximum number allowed for consideration will be removed and discarded prior to evaluation. All projects submitted which are not relevant in scope will be removed and discarded prior to evaluation. Offerors who submit relevant projects for a subsidiary, satellite office, parent company, or predecessor company must fully explain how this office will participate in this contract. If it is not clear how this office will participate in this contract, the project will be removed and discarded prior to evaluation.</p>
<p>(ii) Basis of Evaluation: The Offeror's experience will be evaluated based upon demonstrated Push to Talk Wireless services experience similar in scope, size, type, and complexity to the work in the RFP.</p>
<p>(2) FACTOR 2, PAST PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>(i) Solicitation Submittal Requirements: The Offeror shall submit the following under Tab "2" of their proposal:<br />(1) Submit one of the following for each of the projects submitted under Factor 1 - Offeror Experience:</p>
<p>a. A Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ), a Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) for Services, a Construction Contractor Appraisal Support System (CCASS) Performance Evaluation - Construction Contract, or an Architect- Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) Performance Evaluation.</p>
<p>b. If a commercial project, submit a PPQ.</p>
<p>c. If a Government project, submit a copy of a CPAR, CCASS, or ACASS. The Government will not evaluate any PPQ submitted for a Government project if an official CPAR, CCASS or ACASS evaluation exists in the Government database.</p>
<p>d. An interim CPAR, CCASS, ACASS or PPQ will be accepted for evaluation if an Offeror submits projects which are at least 80%, but less than 100% complete.</p>
<p>(2) If you are submitting a project that your firm performed as a subcontractor, the prime contractor may be cited as the client POC.</p>
<p>(3) Submit projects completed within a five-year period. The five-year period is calculated by counting back five years from the date set for the receipt of proposals in the RFP.</p>
<p>(4) Submit a maximum of five (5) projects for the Offeror.</p>
<p>(2) Basis of Evaluation: The Offeror's past performance will be evaluated based upon client satisfaction on recent relevant Push to Talk Wireless services within the last five (5) years. Client satisfaction will be measured based upon quality of work, effectiveness of management, timely completion of work, and compliance with safety standards. Further, as an integral part of client satisfaction, the Offeror's termination for default history and safety record will also be evaluated. The Government's sources of information for evaluating past performance may include, but are not limited to, any and all information provided by the contractor, inquiries of owner representative(s), any other known sources not provided by the Offeror, Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the Offeror.</p>

EMR and DART Rates shall not be submitted for subcontractors.)<br />(1) Experience Modification Rate (EMR): For the three previous complete calendar years, 2010, 2011 and 2012, submit your EMR (which compares your company's annual losses in insurance claims against its policy premiums over a three year period). If you have no EMR, affirmatively state so, and explain why. Any extenuating circumstances that affected the EMR and upward or downward trends should be addressed as part of this element. Lower EMRs will be given greater weight in the evaluation.</p>
<p>(2) OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rate: For the three previous complete calendar years 2010, 2011 and 2012, submit your OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rate, as defined by the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration. If you cannot submit an OSHA DART Rate, affirmatively state so, and explain why. Any extenuating circumstances that affected the OSHA DART Rate data and upward or downward trends should be addressed as part of this element. Lower OSHA DART Rates will be given greater weight in the evaluation. <br /><br />(3) Technical Approach for Safety: Describe the plan that the Offeror will implement to evaluate safety performance of potential subcontractors, as a part of the selection process for all levels of subcontractors. Also, describe any innovative methods that the Offeror will employ to ensure and monitor safe work practices at all subcontractor levels. The Safety Narrative shall be limited to two pages.</p>
<p>(ii) Basis of Evaluation: The Government is seeking to determine that the Offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to safety and that the Offeror plans to properly manage and implement safety procedures for itself and its subcontractors. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's overall safety record, the Offeror's plan to select and monitor subcontractors, any and innovative safety methods that the Offeror plans to implement for this procurement. The Government's sources of information for evaluating safety may include, but are not limited to, OSHA, NAVFAC's Facility Accident and Incident Reporting (FAIR) database, and other related databases. While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete safety information regarding these submittal requirements rests with the Offeror. The evaluation will collectively consider the following:</p>
<p>- Experience Modification Rate (EMR) <br />- OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rate<br />- Offeror Technical Approach to Safety<br />- Other sources of information available to the Government</p>
<p>(1) Experience Modification Rate (EMR): The Government will evaluate the EMR to determine if the Offeror has demonstrated a history of safe work practices taking into account any upward or downward trends and extenuating circumstances that impact the rating. Lower EMRs will be given greater weight in the evaluation. <br /><br />(2) OSHA Days Away from Work, Restricted Duty, or Job Transfer (DART) Rate: The Government will evaluate the OSHA DART Rate to determine if the Offeror has demonstrated a history of safe work practices taking into account any upward or downward trends and extenuating circumstances that impact the rates. Lower OSHA DART Rates will be given greater weight in the evaluation. <br />(3) Technical Approach to Safety: The Government will evaluate the narrative to determine the degree to which subcontractor safety performance will be considered in the selection of all levels of subcontractors on the upcoming project. The Government will also evaluate the narrative to determine the degree to which innovations are being proposed that may enhance safety on this procurement. Those Offerors whose plan demonstrates a commitment to hire subcontractors with a culture of safety and who propose innovative methods to enhance a safe working environment may be given greater weight in the evaluation.</p>

<DESC>A sole-source contract in the amount of $260,000.00 was awarded to Edwards Lifesciences, One Edwards Way, Irvine, CA 92614 on August 12, 2013 for SAPIEN transcatheter heart valve systems. The SAPIEN valve is the first transcatheter device cleared for commercial use in the United States that allows for aortic valve replacement while the heart continues to beat. It eliminates the need for traditional open-heart surgery. The properties built into SAPIEN systems allows for safer procedures for our Veterans. Other manufacturers products will not be used until their technology improves or the Medical Service opts to use less specialized systems.
