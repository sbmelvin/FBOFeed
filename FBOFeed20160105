STATEMENT OF WORK 

Biospecimen Storage Equipment with a Wireless Monitoring System for Improved Protection
System Description 
We have identified an automated security system (Smart-Vue) capable of monitoring multiple pieces of different storage equipment, that will continuously report on the functional parameters of each piece of equipment and send alert notifications in the event of catastrophic failure or function outside of normal working parameters. The Smart-Vue server software records critical equipment parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide levels, and power status/failure. The software will notify designated personnel of any deviations in the critical parameters using email, telephone (voice calling), or text messaging. Along with this system we would like to purchase several storage devices that are able to directly interface with this wireless monitoring system. This integrated set of equipment includes: 1) three Revco Ultra-Low freezers (necessary for storing frozen samples at -80oC to prevent protein and nucleic acid degradation); 2) one Locator 4 cryogenic storage vessel (necessary for the proper cryopreservation of primary aortic fibroblast and smooth muscle cell cultures); and 3) two VWR Symphony CO2 incubators (essential for maintaining a humidified 37oC with 5% carbon dioxide (21% oxygen) environment for culturing primary cell cultures). Each piece of equipment is monitored by an individual Smart-Vue sensor. The sensor data will be transmitted wirelessly, continuously, and in real-time, to a receiver that collates the data into a database monitored by the Smart-Vue server software that will be loaded onto a computer with battery back-up. Therefore, this integrated package of equipment, with the monitoring system, will provide the necessary security to allow laboratory personnel to ensure safe storage of irreplaceable biospecimens. This provides a layer of security that is not available in most basic science laboratories.
The equipment requested is built to specifically interface easily with the Smart-Vue monitoring system. Importantly, the Smart-Vue system is scalable; if additional freezers, incubators, or cryopreservation vessels are needed, they can be added with the addition of more Smart-Vue sensors (as long as they are compatible with the Smart-Vue security system). Lastly, the wireless nature of this monitoring system allows the researcher to place the equipment in any location within the laboratory (e.g. ultra-low freezers in the freezer room, cryogenic vessel in the main laboratory and the tissue culture incubators in the tissue culture room). Because of space constraints within the laboratory, this level of portability is essential to allow for easy laboratory space planning.
Overall, this integrated set of equipment described above, is essential to provide the needed biospecimen storage and security of irreplaceable human and transgenic mouse biospecimens which are needed to complete the aims of our funded VA BLR&D project.
Clinical Utility
Biospecimens are a critical resource for basic and translational research scientists. The quality and reliability of the data derived from these biospecimens is directly dependent on the quality and consistency of how the samples are being stored. As a result, the need for real-time storage equipment monitoring has become an important requirement, that is often overlooked or taken for granted by investigators. Therefore, the purpose of this equipment request is to acquire a storage equipment solution in order to safeguard irreplaceable human and transgenic mouse samples utilized for ongoing research studies being conducted in the Ralph H. Johnson VAMC research laboratories. 
The system's wireless sensor end-point modules must measure the following parameters:
"	Temperature
"	Temperature + Relative humidity
"	Platinum Resistance Thermometer (PT100)
"	4-20 mA
"	Dry Contact
"	CO2 + Temperature
"	Differential Pressure
"	Internal Temperature Sensor (+10?C to +50?C) with Repeater and Power Outage Alarm
"	Dual Temp Probe
     
The system's wireless sensor must be able to integrate with following pieces of storage
equipment with specific dimensions in order to fit in predetermined locations in the laboratory:
"	Two Revco Ultra-Low freezers (37.6 x 32.4 x 78in; D  x W x H)
"	Locator-4 cryogenic storage vessel (with a 37.5in height and a 22in diameter)
Dual stacked VWR Symphony water-jacketed CO2 incubators (26 x 79 x 25in; D x W x H)

<p>permission to produce a product that does not conform to contract</p>
<p>requirements/documentation for a limited amount of time and for</p>

<p>deviation does not.).</p>
<p>B. Post-Production RFV (previously known as waiver) requests</p>
<p>approval of product found during manufacture, or after having been</p>

<p>Support Activity (ESA), when applicable.</p>
<p>C. Routine ECPs will be processed within 90 days from receipt by</p>
<p>the ESA. RFVs will be evaluated and processed within 30 days from</p>
<p>receipt by the ESA or as negotiated with the ESA.</p>
<p>(1) The contractor will be notified in writing of approval by</p>
<p>the return of an approved copy of the ECP or RFV. Approval will be</p>
<p>reflected by signature of the contracting activity or a review activity</p>
<p>specifically identified in the contract.</p>
<p>(2) The contractor will be notified in writing of disapproval</p>
<p>including reason(s) for disapproval.</p>
<p>5. For an approved RFV or an approved ECP, when the request affects the</p>
<p>Contract, a modification will be issued to the contract incorporating</p>
<p>the applicable requirement changes. Only a Contracting Officer is</p>
<p>authorized to issue a modification incorporating the approved RFV and/or</p>
<p>ECP.</p>
<p>6. Questions regarding the status of previously submitted ECP or RFV</p>
<p>should be directed to the PCO.</p>

<p>is needed, it must be negotiated with the Contracting Officer and</p>
<p>documented via modification to the contract.</p>
<p>8. The period of time for evaluation and approval/disapproval of an ECP</p>
<p>and/or a RFV, as specified in Paragraph 4. C., shall not constitute</p>
<p>excusable delay in the performance of this Contract by the Contractor or</p>

<p>delivery schedule. The submission of an ECP and/or RFV by the</p>
<p>Contractor shall not preclude the Government from exercising its rights</p>
<p>under any clause of the Contract. (End)</p>

2. Provide additional information about DVARS system functionality to industry and request information from interested companies about capabilities, performance, and technical requirements;
3. Seek and identify industry interest in the program and understand existing capabilities of the market, including potential capabilities demonstrations;
4. Collect industry information to further shape and define DVARS in support of a successful Final Investment Decision (FID) and subsequent procurement; and,
5. Inform the industry that the DVARS Program Management Office may be conducting Vendor interviews in the future 
The FAA wishes to thank those interested parties submitting comments to the previous SIR package.  All comments received were reviewed and considered.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with ANSYS, Inc. for the renewal of ANSYS Multiphysics Software to be used by the NIST Information Technology Laboratory (ITL).
<p><br />***** Sole source determination is based on the need to renew ANSYS Multiphysics license that allows ITL to continue its research program on Measurement Multi-Scale Simulation Uncertainty Analysis (MMSSUA). NIST ITL has used ANSYS Multiphysics Software for MMSSUA research since 2002. Use of any other Multiphysics software would require ITL to restart its MMSSUA research, thus losing 12 years of progress and resulting in significant additional costs to the government.</p>
<p>ANSYS Inc. is the only company authorized to sell or renew ANSYS Multiphysics Software in Maryland according to their Major Account Program Coordinator.</p>
<p>*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 511210 - Software Publishers.</p>
<p>****** A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>*****No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for quotations. Interested parties that believe they can satisfy the requirements listed above must identify their capability in writing before the response date of this notice. Only responses received by January 15, 2016, 12:00 p.m., EST will be considered by the government. Responses shall be submitted via email to amber.gray@nist.gov.</p>

<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic is seeking eligible business firms capable of performing Design-Bid Build construction services for P-1461 Addition/Renovation Lejeune High School Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune  Jacksonville N.C.,. This project will be solicited as a competitive full and open solicitation. The appropriate NAICS Code is 236220. This will be a Design-Bid Build (DBB/LPTA) solicitation. 

Description of Acquisition:

The proposed project will include the construction of additions, renovation, and partial demolition of Lejeune High School to create a total 143,500 SF high school on its existing 75 acre campus.
 
The project will require complete demolition of four structures (7,000 sf) on site. Major construction consists of renovation (72,134sf), demolition (45,000sf), and addition (71,122sf) to the existing High School main building.  A new Central Energy Plant, 2-story classroom addition, and kitchen/dining facilities addition will be added to the portion of existing building to remain. 
The project will require the contractor to perform the renovation, addition, and demolition of the facility in multiple phases.  This will ensure current school functions are continuous and not disrupted during construction.  Construction phasing will allow for the construction of a new central energy plant to be constructed prior to the demolition of the existing services.
  Phasing also takes into consideration construction of new food preparation areas and temporary serving areas to insure continuous food service to the students throughout the project duration.  Construction of the new educational areas will occur utilizing some of the existing educational spaces as swing space during the different phases of construction.  The demolition of the large existing educational wing will occur late in the project, once the new educational areas are complete and there is no further need of the use of this area as temporary educational swing space.  Several of the construction phases will require temporary utility installation/support to accommodate the approximate 1-year duration of each phase.
 

Site improvements include a new school sign; new and resurfaced bus and parent/student drop-off drives, visitor/staff and student parking areas with new surfacing; new maintenance and Fire Department access drives; sidewalks; covered walkway (Bid Option), landscaping (Bid Option), bio-retention ponds, and access control.  ATFP and Safety  and  Security measures will be provided.  The project also includes related infrastructure such as electrical primary service, SF6 switched, pad-mounted transformer, and secondary service, direct buried communications duct bank for fiber and copper, and water and gravity sewer services.  New connections to the existing storm and sanitary sewer systems will be provided as well as upgraded gas and water service to the building.

The school will incorporate 21st Century learning communities, called Neighborhoods, comprised of Learning Studios (Classrooms), Hub (Shared Commons Area), Science Labs, Learning Impaired Labs, Group Learning spaces, One-to One meeting spaces, Staff Collaboration, and Storage.
  Educational support spaces are also included such as the information center, computer lab, gymnasium, auditorium, commons/dining area, kitchen, supply and storage areas, art, culinary kitchen, drama, band, JROTC, OT/PT, teacher work rooms, and administrative offices.  

The faade will include storefront with insulating laminated glazing, brick, insulated metal panel, and stucco finishes. Existing EIFS will be removed and replaced while much of the existing brick veneer will remain. Existing roofing will be replaced with new roofing and insulation. Interior finishes include porcelain and rubber tile flooring, painted GWB walls, solid surface countertops, and acoustic ceilings. 

The structure will be composed of shallow concrete foundations, steel frame, with load bearing exterior CMU walls, isolated interior load bearing CMU walls, and metal stud walls.
  Concrete slab on grade will be a 4 floating slab independent of any footings; 6 areas will be utilized in isolated areas.  Expansion joints are provided between new and existing construction.

The cooling system will consist of three (3), water cooled, screw-type chillers piped in parallel in a variable primary flow configuration. The heating system will consist of three (3), high efficiency, condensing type boilers piped in parallel in a variable primary flow configuration. The air side systems will consist of variable volume, modular, central station air handlers and variable volume terminal units with hot water reheat. Due to construction phasing and sequencing, temporary equipment will be required to serve existing and temporary piping and ducting distribution systems.
 New systems will require balancing and commissioning as they are brought online and again at project completion. Temporary systems will require balancing when they are brought online and intermittently throughout construction as their service loads change. All new and temporary equipment and systems will require direct digital controls.

Low flow plumbing fixtures will be utilized along with instantaneous water heaters.

Due to construction types and building areas, the building will be segregated with firewalls to reduce fireproofing of individual components. A new sprinkler system will cover the entire building.  

In accordance with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Silver certification will be the goal of the project.
 An energy dashboard monitor, along with a demonstration domestic solar water heater, exposed structure, and educational signage are included as teaching tools within the building.  
 
The entire electrical distribution system will be replaced in multiple phases with temporary feeders to all existing panels to maintain power throughout construction. Display of information obtained through demand metering and integration with DDC/BAS system is required. The contract will be for a term of approximately (745 days) two years. The estimated cost for this project is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.

<CONTACT>Loesch, Kimberly
<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD) and Office of Research and Development (ORD), Safety Health and Environment Management (SHEM).   

The EPA/ORD/SHEM in Cincinnati, Ohio has a requirement for a steam sterilizer.  The steam sterilizer shall replace an existing sterilizer and be used for the sterilization of infectious materials and wastes of varying composition including but not limited to laboratory glassware, agar solutions, culture plates, pipettes, contaminated PPE, and other infectious wastes.

Note:  This requirement was synopsized from November 9, 2015 to November 24, 2015 under the RFQ Number RFQ-OH-16-00034 titled "Steam Sterilizer for US EPA in Cincinnati, OH."  Based upon the response to the request for quotations, the EPA revised its minimum specifications to remove the back flow prevention device.

The minimum specifications are as follows:  
*	The sterilizer shall have an insulated, single door (either vertical or hinged left hand opening) and be recessed through one wall.
*	Due to surrounding equipment, the sterilizer must fit within the existing wall opening of 74" high x 38"wide.  It also must fit within and allow access for service to both sides based upon a maximum depth from the front of the recessing wall to the rear wall of 72" and a clearance of 18" on each side to adjacent equipment.  
*	Capable of operation utilizing building supplied steam at a pressure of 50 psig.
*	Capable of operation utilizing building supplied potable water at 20 to 50 psig.  
*	Electric - Require no greater than 208/240 VAC, 60 Hz, 3-phase power
*	Have an insulated sterilization chamber of a minimum size of 24" wide x 36" high by 48" deep to meet current equipment and waste processing sizes.
*	Certified and stamped as meeting Underwriters Laboratories Standard 61010-1, Safety Requirements for Electrical Equipment for Measurement, Control, and Laboratory Use - Part 1: General Requirements
*	Certified and stamped as meeting ASME Boiler and Pressure Code Section VIII Division 1.
*	Shall be provided with preprogrammed cycles meeting sterilization requirements for infectious waste as required State of Ohio regulations including a gravimetric, prevacuum, and liquid sterilization cycle.
*	A microcomputer control system with internal battery backup.
*	Control system permits a minimum for the storage of 5 preprogrammed cycles.
*	Controls shall require an access code or other identification method to operate the sterilizer or change cycle parameters.
*	Controls shall be located so as not to expose the sensitive components to steam and heat.
*	Controls shall be capable of providing a printed record of all pertinent cycle data including key transition points in the cycle and alarms and deviations that may jeopardize the sterilization process.
*	Pressure gauges displaying the chamber and jacket pressure accessible to the operator.
*	The following safety features and alarms:
a.	Chamber Emergency Manual Exhaust Valve - allows the operator to vent the chamber and save the product in case of power outage.
b.	Chamber door seal interlock and alarm - prevent cycle starting until the door is sealed and aborts the cycle and safely exhausts the chamber if door seal is lost during the cycle.  Interlock should also prevent the door from being opened until chamber is vented to a safe pressure.
c.	Excessive condensate/vessel flooding - alarm and interlock to abort the cycle and vent the chamber safely if excessive condensate is sensed within the chamber.
d.	Pressure relief valve - prevent chamber pressure greater than rated pressure.
e.	Under Temperature Alarm - informs the operator that the temperature has dropped the sterilization temperature.
f.	Over Temperature Alarm - informs the operator that the chamber temperature has gone above a set point.
g.	Waste line alarm - informs the operator that drain line temperature is outside the normal range.
h.	Pressure/temperature alarm - informs the operator that chamber pressure or temperature readings are outside the normal steam range during sterilize phase.

The requirement includes the disconnection of existing AMSCO Eagle 3041 Sterilizer and movement of the sterilizer to a location within the EPA's facility.  In addition, the EPA requires installation of the new sterilizer, a demonstration, one year preventive maintenance and a minimum of one year warranty.

This procurement will be accomplished using FAR Part 12 and 13 Procedures.  The government anticipates awarding a single fixed price purchase order.   The EPA anticipates award will be made by February 2, 2016.  The request for quotation is anticipated for release on or about January 12, 2016, and will be made available through FedConnect at www.fedconnect.net.  Questions concerning this synopsis should be submitted within 7 calendar days of the date of the publication of this notice.  Submit your questions via FedConnect at www.fedconnect.net.  Telephone requests will not be honored.   One or more of the items under this acquisition are subject to Free Trade Agreements.

SCOPE OF WORK
Ultrasonic Console to include Washer and Rinser

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

The Government intends to enter into a Firm Fixed Price Contract for the Purchase of an Ultrasonic Console to include a Washer and Rinser.  The Vendor shall provide one (1) each Ultrasonic Console Cleaner/Washer and Rinser with Dryer with Left to Right Workflow 20 gallon capacity, 208V/3PH/132Hz.  The contract shall include one (1) each Installation of  Ultrasonic Console.  A three (3) year extended warranty to include all parts and service in addition to the manufactures one (1) year factory warranty  to be delivered and installed at the Amarillo VA Medical Center at 6010 Amarillo Blvd. West in Amarillo, TX that meets or exceeds technical requirements listed below.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

"	Vendor must provide a complete Ultrasonic System as outlined below. 
"	Vendor must provide a 1-year (12 month) standard coverage warranty with 3 year extended comprehensive warranty to include parts, service and any associated/required travel to the facility.
"	A local manufactured certified service representative shall respond in person to all requests for service within 12 hours of contracting the Vendor customer service.  
"	Vendor must provide 2 copies of the service manual and 2 copies of the user's manual

Vendor must provide three (3) references from either VA or non-VA healthcare facilities that can speak to the vendors installation, service and support as it relates to the submitted Ultrasonic  Console (Washer and Rinser).

The Ultrasonic Cleaning System must contain a console consisting of a cleaner, rinser and dryer.  The ultrasonic must cavitate at 132kHz.  This micromechanical scrubbing action is needed to efficiently and effectively clean both hard to reach internal passages and heavily soiled external surfaces of reusable medical equipment.  The Ultrasonic Cleaning System must be able to ultrasonically clean and rinse lumened (cannulated) instrumentation with the use of appropriately sized quick connect adapters that fit both the ultrasonic trays and the instrumentation so that cavitation can occur throughout the internal cannula of the device; heat-sensitive instrumentation and delicate instrumentation.  The unit must have an automated lift elevator, toe touch cycle start (hands-free), automatic fill to maintain water level and quality, port flushing attachments for lumened device flushing capabilities, reverse port flushing capabilities for instruments without ports and a touch pad with preprogrammed cycles.  The Ultrasonic must be environmentally friendly that allows rinse water to be reused up to 12 cycles, thus drastically reducing the amount of water used by the system.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) Development of Science Mission Spacecraft Bus <p> In anticipation of an upcoming NASA Announcement of Opportunity (AO) in 2017, NASA MSFC is seeking information from interested parties regarding development of a science mission Spacecraft bus. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), the information requested is for planning purposes only and is not intended to bind the Government; is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement; nor will the Government pay for information solicited. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal.  However, this RFI serves as the first step in the competitive process described in the NASA FAR under paragraph 1872.308 for selecting an industrial partner as a team member. Please note, at this juncture, no solicitation exists; therefore, please do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential respondents responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This RFI is subject to FAR 52.215-3. <p> The subject Spacecraft bus is required to enable a Principal Investigator (PI) led Heliophysics mission. The goal of this mission is to observe the sun in the near ultra-violet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, and transmit images to designated ground stations for scientific evaluation. Concept studies are currently under development by the NASA team.  <p> Description of Anticipated Requirements: <p> This RFI seeks interested parties and openly solicits potential partners by requesting specific information that will be used to determine a teaming relationship for developing a NASA proposal in response to the upcoming AO.  NASA envisions a teaming arrangement where the partner will 1) serve as the PIs Prime Contractor; 2) lead the proposal development and management activities for the mission team (with MSFC and other partners providing direct input to the proposal); 3) develop and deliver a complete Spacecraft design, hardware, software, and ground support equipment; 4) integrate science instruments with the Spacecraft bus; and 5) provide mission operations systems and support.  Note that NASA cannot reimburse the industrial partner for the costs for managing the proposal development.  <p> The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified sources that are interested in pursuing this type of arrangement. Potential partners will be identified from the responses received from this request.  NASA intends to select a single industrial partner for participation in the proposal based on these inputs. Responses from all interested parties, including non-U.S. organizations, are solicited. Recognizing that any collaboration between NASA and a non-U.S. organization must be consistent with NASA's no-exchange-of-funds policy where each nation is responsible for its own activities, any non-U.S. response should identify the source of funding and discuss the status of funding commitments. <p> Information obtained through this RFI will be used by NASA to evaluate available Spacecraft capabilities and interfaces for potential use in the subject missions. The Spacecraft is expected to provide capability to meet the following requirements at a minimum: <p> 1.	Launch in 2021  2022 2.	Launch on vehicles defined in the standard NLS-II catalog, such as Athena II or Taurus 3210 launch vehicles to a Sun-synchronous orbit 3.	Sustain a Phase E mission duration of 3 years 4.	Carry a rigid payload mass of approximately 100-150 kg.  This science instrument payload may consist of a context telescope, a spectrometer, up to four large format (>50 megapixel) cameras, and 1-2 electronic boxes 5.	Provide co-alignment of payload instruments within 1 arcminute 6.	Provide fixed-position solar arrays for power generation, with secondary batteries for energy storage during eclipse periods and propulsive maneuvers 7.	Provide the science payloads uplink/downlink communications: -	Uplink Spacecraft engineering data from ground stations (S-band) twice per day -	Downlink science data to ground stations or TDRSS (about 1000 GB/day) 8.	Provide electric power to science instrument (210 W Peak)  9.	Provide guidance, navigation, and control services and ancillary data 10.	Accommodate thermal control of the payload 11.	Provide data storage sufficient for Spacecraft operations (approximately 2 GB) 12.	Provide fine pointing while interfacing with instrument-provided reference guide telescope 13.	Provide a Pitch Accuracy of 20 arcsec, Knowledge of 15 arcsec, and stability of 1 arcsec per second 14.	Provide a Yaw Accuracy of 20 arcsec, Knowledge of 15 arcsec, and stability of 1 arcsec per second 15.	Provide a Roll Accuracy of 120 arcsec, Knowledge of 50 arcsec, and stability of 50 arcsec per second 16.	Provide Pointing Control 1 arcsec Peak to Peak for periods of 1-2 seconds at a time 17.	Provide Pointing Jitter: < 0.05 arcsec/sec from S/C bandwidth to 45Hz 18.	Enable an uninterrupted observation time of at least 3 hours 19.	If required by an orbital debris analysis, provide a controlled re-entry capability at mission end of life <p> It is not NASAs intent to publicly disclose proprietary information obtained through this RFI. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as Proprietary or Confidential will be kept confidential.  <p> This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.	Respondents will not be notified of the results. <p> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at <A HREF="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html">http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/p ub_library/Omb.html </A>   .   <p> The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/MSFC Business Opportunities home page is <A HREF="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=62">http://prod.nais.nasa .gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=62 </A>    It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet cite for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments, if any. <p>

<p>Description <br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) PEO SUB seeks information as to potential qualified sources with experience and expertise necessary to develop and produce a Large Vertical Array (LVA) for SONAR. The LVA will have application to the Ohio Class and Virginia Blocks III and IV submarine classes. The LVA shall consist of acoustic sensors, outboard electronic bottles (OBE), cables, and fixtures for manufacturing and installation to the submarine hull. The acoustic sensors will be arranged in the form of acoustic modules as documented in the specifications. Candidates should be capable of producing large submarine hull-mounted arrays and be capable of sustaining a throughput of up to three systems a year on this program. The materials utilized should be capable of sustaining long periods of submersion in salt water and withstand the harsh environments at varying ocean depths. Candidate systems are required to have the capability to be integrated and interoperable with the AN/BQQ-10(V) Sonar System installed on US Submarines. The outboard electronics will be predicated on an open-system architecture with no proprietary hardware or software included. The LVA outboard components shall meet the requirements of a performance specification (currently in draft) with a particular focus on ensuring arrays meet Grade B shock requirements. The performance specification document will not be posted as an attachment to this sources sought notice. Interested parties may request the draft performance specifications including the System Specification, Sensor Specification, Array Panel Specification, and OBE Specification from Matt Kopp via email. The System Specification is classified CONFIDENTIAL and will be mailed to sources with a validated security clearance. The Sensor Specification, Array Panel Specification, and OBE Specification are not classified and will be distributed electronically to those sources with a valid CAGE code.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an organizational unit within HUD, administers the single-family mortgage insurance program. FHA insures approved lenders against the risk of loss on loans they finance for the purchase, and in some instances rehabilitation, of single-family homes.&nbsp; When an FHA insured loan goes into default, the lender is required to evaluate each defaulted borrower for loss mitigation, and if loss mitigation is not feasible, to commence foreclosure timely.&nbsp; Following foreclosure, the lender may convey the foreclosed property to HUD and file a claim for insurance benefits.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">The National Servicing Center (NSC) provides national servicing and loss mitigation support to FHA lenders and borrowers in the form of client-based loss mitigation assistance and servicing complaint resolution.&nbsp; NSC also monitors loan servicing activities of all FHA approved servicers and lenders, evaluates risk to the FHA fund through statistical analysis, reviews default and foreclosure information for program study, and manages FHA assigned and subordinate loans owned by HUD known as the Secretary-Held portfolio.&nbsp; </span></p>

The current contract is a Fixed Price requirements contract currently awarded to Verdi Consulting, Inc.</span></p>

<DESC>Request for Information<br />United States Department of Homeland Security<br />Plum Island Animal Disease Center<br />Integrated Project Management<br />Service Contract Performance Monitoring Using Earned Value Management, Project Management Principles and Quality Standards
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) is located on Plum Island, New York, approximately 1.5 miles from the eastern end of Long Island's North Fork.  In June 2003, operational responsibility for PIADC was transferred from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to DHS.  Dedicated to the advancement of knowledge related to and technology for the control and eradication of foreign animal diseases, PIADC is a unique research facility whose mission includes the development of vaccines, performance of diagnostic testing, and implementation of various applied research projects.  PIADC is a secure Government Owned-Government Operated (GO-GO) facility. The majority of the Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) and security functions are contracted.   The physical and operational infrastructure are, in many respects, similar to what would be required to support a small town, including potable water and waste water, steam, back-up power generation, and transportation.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Historically Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) contracts have been used for O&amp;M at PIADC. The O&amp;M services contract will be combined all under one into one Center Wide Support Program (CWSP) contract for an effective and efficient PIADC operation. Traditional practices for monitoring, measuring, and evaluating O&amp;M services were insufficient to ensure that contract performance management was aligned with strategic intent and focused on the highest priority areas of performance.  DHS PIADC has developed and implemented new methods for service contract monitoring and evaluation that are based on industry accepted management standards.  PIADC refers to this effort as "Integrated Program Management" (IPM).  IPM uses Earned Value Management (EVM) to plan and monitor cost and schedule performance, while using elements of Project Management Principles and defined in the Project Management Institutes Project Management Book of Knowledge (PMBOK) and the International Standard ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management Systems - Requirements (ISO-9001), to further align with management.</p>
<p>A Model for Integrated Program Management</p>
<p>(See the diagram in the attached *.pdf entitled RFI-DHS-PIADC-IPM-20160104.)</p>
<p>IPM is a system of monitoring the cost, schedule and quality elements of a project or program and reports the budgeted, the actuals, and the amount of work completed during a given period.  Each professional component of IPM has strengths desired by PIADC.  The PMBOK provides the basic project management principles to be used, EVM provides the basis for monitoring cost and schedule and ISO 9001 provides the quality processes and standards that complement the PMBOK and EVM.  As seen in the Venn diagram above, the PMBOK brings planning, and the ISO 9001 brings the infrastructure and procedures.  The area where the two circles intersect is what PIADC is managing, i.e. using metrics to value "Level of Effort" (LOE).</p>
<p>Applying EVM in a services environment is challenging because the traditional view is that such services are largely considered LOE. Earned value of strictly LOE work only documents the passage of time and not actual project progress (that is, the planned value equals the earned value as soon as the time period elapses).  For this reason, traditional approaches for many LOE activities are insufficient for monitoring, measuring and evaluating work in a services environment.</p>
<p>Purpose and Scope of Request for Information</p>
<p>PIADC is committed to advancing IPM practices in order to improve the contract oversight and effectively and efficiently manage the cost and schedule of work in a services environment.  The intent is to advance the concepts and principles of IPM developed at PIADC to further integrate the principles into service contract management at other DHS facilities in a broader capacity.</p>
<p>PIADC is seeking the help of a recognized professional in EVM and program management circles to assist in advancing IPM approaches and practices.  Such a professional will provide a fresh perspective and new ideas.  PIADC is requesting information on the availability of a highly specialized senior executive level professional to assist in the evaluation of competition, source selection, transition, and base period for the CWSP.</p>
<p>PIADC is interested in an industry professional with significant experience in developing, overseeing, and implementing performance assessment policy at senior levels of the government.  The goal is to leverage the prior senior executive experience of the professional.  The professional should have extensive experience taking different aspects of program management principles (quality, PMBOK, acquisition, monitoring root cause analysis) and applying them to create new program management systems.  The professional should be recognized as a leader in earned value and project management lecture and seminar circuits, well respected and has the ability to present and receive consensus on new project management processes.  The professional must be open to adapting industry accepted standards and tailoring them to suit the needs of PIADC, in effect change the paradigm.  A mentoring and training background is critical to be able to deliver new program management policies and products to Government agencies at all levels.</p>
<p>The experience shall include knowledge of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and experience in developing training systems for staff that work on complex procurements.  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to give the Government a better understand of capability statements and the market regarding a professional that has a very unique skill set that can change the way project management is executed in a services contract environment worldwide.  The ability to influence and manage change is critical.  Extensive public speaking skills (in EVM and project management circles) are essential.  The ability to present to senior executive level personnel is critical.</p>
<p>The professional shall support the PIADC Program Office during the CWSP competitions source selection process.  The professional shall be responsible for planning, executing and closing out the first option year Integrated Baseline Review (IBR) for the CWSP contract. This support shall set a high standard for subsequent year IBRs.</p>
<p>The professional shall work the PIADC Program Office to establish a monthly program management review process to review cost, schedule, and technical and risk status.  As part of this task the professional shall help</p>
<p>the PIADC Program Office establish a formalized risk management review board to manage the risks of the O&amp;M service contract.  Also included in this task the professional shall train and mentor the Government personnel to review and evaluate monthly cost, schedule technical quality and risk status to prepare the government for the monthly PMR.</p>
<p>PIADC is seeking one professional to perform all of these support services.</p>
<p>The candidate must sign a non-compete contract for the CWSP to support the PIADC mission and a nondisclosure agreement.</p>

<CONTACT>Allen A. Tillman , Contract Specialist, Phone (410) 762-6442, Email allen.a.tillman@uscg.mil
<DESC>1. The United States Coast Guard is conducting market research to support design/procurement/installation in the replacement of the existing Fire and Smoke Detection System aboard the USCGC ALEX HALEY (WMEC-39). Period of Performance based off cutter operational schedule is expected to be 05/01/2017-06/12/2017.
<p>2. The current shipboard fire alarm system (individual battery powered alarms) provides incomplete coverage. Areas outside of central fire alarm coverage (machinery spaces and magazines) are monitored by discrete fire alarms that do not activate the quarterdeck alarm panel.</p>
<p>3. The replacement fire detection and alarm system shall be in accordance with ABS Steel Vessel Rules 1998/99, IEEE STD 45, 46 CFR 111.15, 46 CFR 113.10, 46 CFR 161.002, SOLAS Chapter II-2, NFPA 72, and ASTM F1198. Components for the fire and smoke detection system shall be type approved under 46 CFR 161.002. If batteries are used as part of the fire and smoke detection system, they shall meet the standards of 46 CFR 111.15. The system shall use addressable detectors; alarms shall be reported by Type, Zone, and detector location.</p>
<p>REQUESTED INFORMATION:</p>
<p>USCG requires input concerning the businesses ability to meet requirements 1-3 above. Specifically:</p>
<p>i) What's available in the commercial marketplace? If using an existing design, please provide documentation showing application and effectiveness.</p>
<p>ii) The potential offerors would need to perform some level of engineering design and analysis in order to develop their proposal. Is that acceptable to offerors?</p>
<p>iii) What timeframe could an executable design be proposed to include necessary drawings and calculations?</p>
<p>iv) What is your Rough Order Of Magnitude Estimate of the range of value of this proposed procurement?</p>
<p>v) Small business size status.</p>
<p>vi) Any other information pertinent to this RFI as it relates to the ability to provide a solution.</p>
<p>Technical Information for this Requirement:</p>
<p>Zone Address Identification Capability</p>
<p>The Zone Address Identification Capability shall have fixed fire detection and fire alarm systems with a sensor level address identification capability and be arranged so that:</p>
<p>i. Means are provided to ensure that any fault (e.g. power break, short circuit; earth) occurring in the loop will not render the whole loop ineffective (this requirement is considered satisfied when a fault occurring in the loop only renders ineffective a part of the loop not being larger than a section of a system without means of remotely identifying each detector.);</p>
<p>ii. All arrangements are made to enable the initial configuration of the system to be restored in the event of failure (electrical, electronic, informatics)</p>
<p>iii. The first initiated fire alarm will not prevent any other detector to initiate further fire alarms</p>
<p>iv. No loop will pass through a space twice. When this is not practical (e.g. for large public spaces), the part of the loop which by necessity passes through the space for a second time shall be installed at the maximum possible distance from the other parts of the loop.</p>
<p>v. The system display will provide the operator with the compartment number, compartment name, the type of alarm and the sensor specific number.</p>
<p>1 System Requirements<br />Remote control and monitoring of the Fire Detection and Alarm System shall be provided at a Damage Control Central, the Central Control Station, and selected Distributed Workstations.<br />Fire Detection and Alarm System control panels and indicating units shall be provided in accordance with 1.5 and 1.6.</p>
<p>1.1 Readiness<br />Any required fixed fire detection and fire alarm system with manually operated call points shall be capable of immediate operation at all times.</p>
<p>1.2 System Monitoring<br />Power supplies and electric circuits necessary for the operation of the system shall be monitored for loss of power or fault conditions as appropriate. Occurrence of a fault condition shall initiate a visible and audible fault signal at the control panel which shall be distinct from a fire signal.</p>
<p>1.3 Arrangement of Power Supplies<br />There shall be not less than two sources of power supply for the electrical equipment used in the operation of the fixed fire detection and fire alarm system, one of which shall be an emergency source. The supply shall be provided by separate feeders reserved solely for that purpose. Such feeders are to run to an automatic change-over switch situated in or adjacent to the control panel for the fire detection system.</p>
<p>1.4 System Arrangements<br />Detectors and manually operated call points shall be grouped into sections. The activation of any detector or manual operated call point shall initiate a visual and audible fire signal at the control panel and indicating units.</p>
<p>1.5 Location of Control Panel<br />The control panel shall be located at a Engineering Control Central.</p>
<p>1.6 Indicating Units and Their Locations<br />Indicating units are to show which section a detector has been activated or manually operated call point has been operated. Indicating units shall be provided at a Damage Control Central, Bridge, Central Control Station, Combat Information Center, Quarterdeck Stations, and other remote locations as approved by the Naval Technical Authority.</p>
<p>1.7 Information for Each Indicating Unit<br />Clear information shall be displayed on or adjacent to each indicating unit about the spaces covered and the location of the sections.</p>
<p>1.8 Zone Address Identification Capability<br />Fixed fire detection and fire alarm systems with a zone address identification capability shall be so arranged that:</p>
<p>i) Means are provided to ensure that any fault (e.g. Power break, short circuit; earth) occurring in the loop will not render the whole loop ineffective (this requirement is considered satisfied when a fault occurring in the loop only renders ineffective a part of the loop not being larger than a section of a system without means of remotely identifying each detector.)</p>
<p>ii) All arrangements are made to enable the initial configuration of the system to be restored in the event of failure (electrical, electronic, informatics);</p>
<p>iii) The first initiated fire alarm will not prevent any other detector to initiate further fire alarms;</p>
<p>iv) No loop will pass through a space twice. When this is not practical (e.g. For large public spaces), the part of the loop which by necessity passes through the space for a second time shall be installed at the maximum possible distance from the other parts of the loop.</p>

<p>Acquisition under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996) or the authority of the Services Reform Act of 2003 (41 U.S.C. 428a), Soliciting from a Single Source FAR 13.106-1(b)(2).</p>
<p>4. Reasons for Sole Source<br />Pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) "Contracting Officers may solicit from one source if the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name or industrial mobilization.)"</p>
<p>(1) Background: After the events of September 11, 2001 the Federal government authorized the use of law enforcement to make emphasis patrols to protect project areas such as Libby Dam. Memorandum for Records: Application of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2465 to Civil Works Projects and Facilities dated September 24, 2001 and Memorandum for Record: Law Enforcement Services at Corps Water Resources Development Projects under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1962d-5d dated November 2, 2005, document the authorities and legal opinions allowing for law enforcement emphasis patrols during non-duty hours for projects like Libby Dam. Lincoln County Sheriff's office has provided law enforcement duties for Libby Dam since 2005.</p>
<p>(2) Justification:</p>
<p>The Lincoln County Sheriff's Office (LCSO) is the only law enforcement agency having the authority and capability to provide the services required on Libby Dam lands based on the following:</p>
<p>(a) They have full authority to enforce, and make arrests if necessary, local, state, and federal laws on lands and waters associated with the Project (concurrent jurisdiction). They have the authority to take formal action in the event of unlawful or terrorist activity at Libby Dam and are staffed and equipped to do so on a sustained basis. Security Guard contractors do not have this authority.<br />(b) LCSO owns the additional security monitoring devices outside of Corps owned security surrounding Libby Dam.<br />(c) Given heightened security, Libby Dam must have presence of official law enforcement (LE) officials as the project is a critical storage facility on the Columbia River System. Libby Dam is critical infrastructure with half of its reservoir in Canada. This represents a backdoor to the dam. Capability, visibility and ability to respond are critical to the protection of this upper drainage storage facility. LCSO is the only official law enforcement presence in the vicinity of the project.<br />(d) LCSO are available for increased forced protection system plans.<br />(e) LCSO is a part of the MT anti-terrorism council (private companies are NOT part of this critical infrastructure protection in Montana) and has the ability to call in other agencies to support contracted activities or react to emergencies and security incidents.<br />(f) LCSO patrols by foot and vehicle on all disjunct Corps lands. <br />(g) LCSO are available 24/7. <br />(h) LCSO are 17 miles from the dam providing a quick response times for emergency situations and incidents that occur at Libby Dam. <br />(i) Libby Dam security requires appropriate armament, training, and authority for stop, seize and arrest. LCSO has this response capability, communications systems, and network of real time support and intelligence from all law agencies, federal, state and local. They also have bomb threat and low level SWAT response capability for action against violence, domestic disputes or terrorist activity.</p>
<p>5. No solicitation package will be issued. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 2:00 PM Pacific Time on 19 January 2016. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Monique.a.paano@usace.army.mil. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD intends to negotiate solely (as prescribed in FAR 13.106(b)(1)(i) with Sinclair Bio-Resources, P.O. Box 658, Columbia, MO 65205, for the procurement of miniature swine. <br />Sinclair Bio-Resources is uniquely qualified to provide the Sinclair model of miniature swine. This exact type of miniature swine has been deemed the model to use for USAMRCID's research in the U1037 work. In order to maintain the merit and validity of scientific research, lab-quality animals, Sinclair Minipigs, are needed from Sinclair Bio-Resources. Research results and the long history of research based on Sinclair-bred Sinclair Miniature swine would be compromised with the introduction of swine from another source and herd. To change this model of miniature swine with another vendor's model would add variables to the research dramatically affecting the research, its results and contrasting beyond scientific explanation with historical data. The only way to compare future research results is to use the same model (Sinclair Miniature Swine).
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 112990 and the size standard of 750,000.</p>
<p>Three (3) days after the publication of this notice, the purchase will be awarded without further remarks. All questions and responses concerning this notice shall be emailed to Ms. Sheila Watford at sheila.r.watford.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<SOLNBR>SPE4A5-13-R-0680-01
<RESPDATE>020416
<CONTACT>Patrick R. OConnor, Acqusistion Specialist, Phone 8042796721, Email patrick.oconnor@dla.mil
<DESC>&nbsp;TITLE:<br />Multiple NSNs for Unison Industries, Sole Source Long Term Contract
<p>This agency proposes to issue a Letter Request for Proposal (RFP) for add-on NSNs to the Unison Industries, SPE4A5-13-R-0680-01, a long-term strategic, sole source contract which will include multiple NSNs and FSCs to support various weapon systems. These items are being added to the Unison contract, SPE4A5-14-D-0019, in accordance with the approved J&amp;A. However, the NSNs identified herein were not included in the list of original items synopsized for this effort.</p>
<p>The proposed items are intended for addition to the existing sole source contract to Unison Industries, SPE4A5-14-D-0019 for the following Unison cage 59501. A total of eleven (11) NSNs are targeted for this contract effort. This procurement has a Surge &amp; Sustainment requirement. These items have been identified as sole source however some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM. This requirement contains Air Force designated Critical Safety Items (CSI). This is a Requirements Type Contract currently in the first option year, with three option years remaining for a total duration of four years period of performance. The contract requires supply of parts with agreed to terms of FOB: Origin and Inspection/Acceptance: Origin. Subcontracting opportunities do exist for this effort.</p>
<p>Letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). This is proposed to be a FAR Part 12 effort. The attached lists of NSNs are the items that have been identified for this current action. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM); therefore, if any non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the solicitation closing date.</p>
<p>Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. (Note: Other Aviation sites will provide their equivalent surplus clause, as applicable).</p>
<p>Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by 04 February 2015 and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified. In addition, respondents should identify the quantity available and price. A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and SBA PCR (anne.mastrincola@dla.mil). The Government may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>All responses must be submitted via hardcopy to Patrick O'Connor at patrick.oconnor@dla.mil</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Office of Counsel estimates that court reporting services for hearings are anticipated on January 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 2016. These dates will be between the hours of approximately 8:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time. Each deposition or proceeding will consist of approximately seven hours of testimony, one lunch hour break, and 10 minute breaks approximately every hour. Court reporting services will be needed at 700 Robbins Ave, Building 36 Philadelphia, PA 19111. The anticipated length of each deposition will be one full day, per deponent or proceeding and the length of the transcript for a full day is approximately 250 pages. We require a court reporter that will type a word for word written transcript of live testimony using a stenotype machine. This will allow the attorneys to have questions and testimony read back during the proceeding. After the proceeding is concluded the court reporting service will deliver a typed transcript to DLA Troop Support Office of Counsel within three business days after the deposition or proceeding has ended, unless an expedited delivery is requested. The timeframe for an expedited delivery is 48 hours from the end of the proceeding. The court reporting service will designate a separate price for this expedited delivery service.</p>

Applicant MUST have completed an Emergency Medicine residency and be Board Certified in Emergency Medicine.</p>
<p>Contractors are sought to help fill the difficult gaps in the ER schedule. They are often put on the schedule for nights, weekends, holidays, and are often grouped into several shifts when needed during a short period of time. Sometimes, they are not scheduled for an extended period of time to ensure the other permanent doctors get enough shifts for their any -80- requirements. Sometimes, there is a need of several shifts to be filled within a short period of time. Even though not convenient, they frequently have to cover single shifts when needed. This can result in significant expense for those traveling a long distance, but cannot always be avoided. We aim to group shifts into at least two days in a row, but often that cannot be arranged.</p>
<p>TOUR OF DUTY:</p>
<p>We have 10 hour shifts. There is single coverage, except for 4-5 PM and 9PM-2AM. Day shift is 7AM-5PM. Evening shift is 4PM-2AM. Night shift is 9PM-7AM. Available shifts can come from a combination of weekday, weeknight and/or weekend shifts, including Holidays (Rates to be all inclusive).</p>
<p>On the average, there will be 4 ten-hour shifts per pay period (two weeks), but that is only an average. This can vary greatly, depending on everyones schedule and availability.</p>
<p>Schedule dates are forthcoming and will be emailed to requesting agencies.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>Upon success credential and fingerprint clearance to December, 2015. There are additional shifts available thereafter.</p>
<p>Fill Dates:</p>
<p>Please request latest ER schedule by email</p>
<p>DUTIES:</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a contract for the procurement of one Transportable Flight Proficiency Simulator (TFPS) Shelter from Oshkosh Specialty Vehicles a division of Pierce Manufacturing Inc. (OSV) for inclusion in the CH-47F TFPS number 23 under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  CH-47F TFPS 23 is being constructed at Naval Air Warfare Systems Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Simulation Division.  
The CH-47F is a transportable simulator and all components are required to be ruggedized to survive movement of the simulator.
  The TFPS CH-47F shelter is one such component. Currently, the TFPS    CH-47F shelter is the only commercially available shelter that will meet the Government requirements. The TFPS CH-47F shelter is solely manufactured and distributed by OSV, a division of Pierce Manufacturing Inc.
The TFPS Ch-47 Shelter provides a climate controlled shelter for integration of the CH-47F CrewView VDS trainer from Flight Safety International. The TFPS CH-47F Shelter is designed to be transported via land, air and sea. The TFPS CH-47F shelter has been certified by the United States Air Force to fly on a C-5 aircraft. The shelter provides 317-3/4W x 317-3/4L x 196H of interior space. In addition, the shelter has an Environmental Control System (ECS) for extreme conditions for both equipment and the shelter environment (separately controlled).
 The shelter also contains a fire detection system, lighting protection system and a 40KVA uninterruptable power supple
FAR Part 12.101(b) states that agencies shall acquire commercial items or non-developmental items when they are available to meet the needs of the agency. Since OSVs TFPS CH-47F shelter is the only commercial item that is compatible with the CH-47F CrewView VDS from Flight Safety International (FSI) and the Government has neither the intellectual property rights nor data necessary to provide to another contractor to develop a compatible shelter, this acquisition will be sole source.
This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. It is a notice that outlines the Governments intent to contract on a sole source basis with Flight Safety International.
 Interested sources desiring to contest this synopsis may do so by asserting its supportable rationale via email to Brandon Haas, Brandon.Haas@navy.mil in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2010, no later than 18 January 2016 at 1300 EST. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  No solicitation document is available. If no written contest to this synopsis is received, a Justification and Approval (J and A) in accordance with FAR Part 6.303 based on the rationale provided above will be initiated.  If conducted as sole source procurement with OshKosh Specialty Vehicles, no further synopsis will be provided.

<p>1.	Overview:<br />Since the end of Liberia's civil war in the fall of 2003, USAID's programs have been instrumental in aiding the transition from relief and reconstruction.  USAID/Liberia has shifted its emphasis to sustainable development, with programs that concentrate on establishing a stable democracy, changing the culture of impunity, systematic corruption and poor governance, closing severe gaps in access to quality education and health care, expanding economic opportunity through agricultural enterprise and natural resources management, and helping to rebuild essential infrastructure and sources of renewable energy.</p>
<p>USAID is the largest bilateral donor in the country and maintains close relationships with a range of Government of Liberia counterparts.  The Mission's development program focuses resources in four technical areas - Economic Growth, Health, Education and Democracy, Rights &amp; Governance, which are supported by four support offices - Program and Project Development, Acquisition &amp; Assistance, Financial Management and Executive.  The Environmental Compliance, Science and Technology Advisor is located in the Mission's Program and Project Development Office.</p>
<p>2.	Functions of the Position:<br />Located in USAID/Liberia's Program and Project Development (PPD) Office, the Environmental Compliance, Science and Technology Advisor serves as a U.S. Personal Services Contractor (USPSC) or Eligible Family member (EFM) who supports: i) the management of the Mission's environmental compliance activities; ii) the integration of USAID's Global Development Lab initiatives, in response to Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), into the Mission's longer-term development portfolio; and iii) the coordination of the U.S. Government's (USG) interagency health activities with a primary focus on the implementation of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA).  The principal responsibility of the incumbent is working to ensure the successful implementation of mandatory environmental assessments as well as environmental compliance monitoring and reporting for all activities in the USAID/Liberia portfolio. USAID/Liberia intends to recruit for a Foreign Service National (FSN) Environmental Compliance Specialist to serve as the Mission Environmental Officer (MEO).  The Advisor will work closely with the Environmental Compliance Specialist to assist that individual to come fully up to speed on the requirements of the position.  Both of them will coordinate with the Deputy MEO as well as with the Mission Environmental Compliance Team (comprised of representatives from technical and support offices) to fulfill monitoring and reporting responsibilities on environmental compliance for USAID/Liberia's health; infrastructure; agriculture; natural resources management; democracy, rights and governance; education and other programs. In order to ensure prudent environmental management and compliance, he/she works closely with all Contracting/Agreement Officer's Representatives (COR/AOR) and their alternates, activity managers, Team Leaders and Office Directors. The incumbent develops and maintains professional contacts in both the public and private sectors, including Government of Liberia (GOL) officials, implementing partners, consultants, non-governmental organizations, and other relevant development partners in Liberia. Secondary responsibilities for the Advisor include working closely with the Global Development Lab's Ebola Response Technical Advisor (ERTA) and PPD's Team Leader for Planning and Resource Management to coordinate Lab-funded and USAID/Liberia-funded activities that relate to the utilization of Information and Communications Technology (ICT).  In addition, the Advisor will assist with the implementation of the GHSA by supporting the coordination of the GHSA-related activities of USAID/Liberia and other U.S. Government agencies.</p>
<p>Under the supervision of the Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Officer in the Knowledge and Implementation Management Team in PPD, the Advisor shall fulfill the following duties (60%):</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Solicitation number is HSCG85-15-Q-P45P58 is issued as a Total Small Busines Set Aside (SBSA) Request for Quotations (RFQ). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-83 dated 02 July 2015. The applicable NAICS Code is 336611 with a size standard of 1,000 employees. The contract will be awarded on a firm-fixed-price basis. To receive an award, the Contractor must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov .<br /><br />This requirement is for Scheduled Dry Dock Repairs of USCGC GEORGE COBB (WLM-175) consisting of items in accordance with the attached specification (ATTACHMENT 2).<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

(D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern.
?Registered in the SAM database? means that?
  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 
  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>?System for Award Management (SAM)? means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.
  (3)  If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose.

The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<DESC>The quote submission deadline is hereby extended and the following Request for Information is answered:<br /><br />Question: For the two (2) hours each day Monday thru Friday for coached on-deck swim instruction and aquatics workout sessions, what time is this currently scheduled for and does that current schedule work for the needs?
<p><br />Answer: The swim program typically starts at 1300 and ends at 1500 daily, and there will be very few exceptions throughout the year that the time would need to change. The main reason why the time might need to be moved is when the pool is scheduled for mandatory training, which is anticipated 4-5 times per year for a couple of days each time.</p>

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>Amendment 02<br />The purpose of this Amendment 02 is to post three questions and their answers.
<p>Q1. Is this a follow-on requirement? If so, could you please provide the incumbent contract number for this opportunity? If not, is this a new requirement?<br />A1. The current contract is held by Basis Technology, HHM402-11-C-0084.</p>
<p>Q2. If the prime has never undergone an audit but holds accounting policies, separates incurred costs &amp; is compliant- will the government accept the price volume without the prime undergoing a DCAA audit prior to submission? In short, does the prime need to have an approved or compliant accounting system to be considered for this opportunity?<br />A2. No, the prime does not need to have an approved or compliant accounting system. This is not a cost type contract.</p>
<p>Q3. How many past performances are you seeking from the offeror? I didn't see a number but saw the criteria/requirement.<br />A3. The Government has not set a number. Typically three is a good number, but there is no standard.</p>
<br />

Amendment 03<br />The purpose of this Amendment 03 is to post one question and its answer.<br />Q4. Can we add a team member who does not have a facility clearance? In short, as long as the prime has a Top Secret facility clearance--is that sufficient?<br />A4. It is sufficient that the prime has a Top Secret facility clearance. A potential subcontractor has no privity of contract with the Government.<br /><br />Amendment 04<br />The purpose of this Amendment 04 is to post a revision to the Statement of Work, titled final and dated 05 January 2016. All prospective offerors are cautioned to use this version of the SOW.<br />

<DESC>****The Response date has been extended to January 7, 2016 @ 4 PM EST.<br /><br />SPECIAL NOTICE: SOURCE SOUGHT &amp; REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for information received as a result of this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests to include an invite to further explain/demonstrate aspects of their propose approach. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. As part of this special notice DCMA will be evaluating for planning purposes if there are an adequate number of qualified and interested small business contractors capable of providing the services and/or products.
<p>OVERVIEW<br />The Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) provides direct program management support to the Department of Defense (DoD) in the development and sustainment of Government Contract Writing and Administration Systems (CWASs) such as Modification Delivery Order (MDO), Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS), Standard Procurement System (SPS), and other DoD eCommerce tools. Further, DCMA works hand-in-hand with DoD Components to ensure electronic processing of contracting actions into Department and Federal data systems that support all aspects of the Procure to Pay Process (P2P). DCMA supports its user community with a vast data infrastructure and applications to efficiently and effectively execute the agency's Contract Administration Services (CAS) mission and various administrative processes. DCMA is two years into a five year strategy to automate re-engineered CAS business processes into an Integrated Workload Management System (IWMS). IWMS uses the Blackpearl (K2) Business Process Management Suite (BPMS) and a SharePoint 2010 instantiation to provide Contract Administration Services to the DoD. IWMS is also integrated with HP Trim to provide DoD mandated 5015.2 compliant records management for the agency's electronic contract management records and administrative files.</p>
<p>DCMA is considering replacing HP Trim with a SharePoint "bolt-on" 5015.2 compliant records management capability to reduce hardware infrastructure, simplify BPMS integration and reduce electronic records maintenance and sustainability costs. A SharePoint 5015.2 compliant records management capability will save the government hundreds of thousands of dollars that can be redirected to our core CAS mission and other support areas by eliminating HP Trim servers, consolidating documents and records into one central storage location and streamlining records management and integration with existing systems.</p>
<p>ABOUT DCMA</p>
<p>DCMA is the Department of Defense's component that works directly with defense suppliers to help ensure that DoD, Federal, and allied government supplies and services are delivered on time, at projected cost, and meet performance requirements.</p>
<p>DCMA provides Contract Administration Services to the DoD Acquisition Enterprise and its partners to ensure delivery of quality products and services to the warfighter; on time and on cost. DCMA is a recognized leader of, and contributor to many of DoD's business reform initiatives. Those initiatives' goals are to improve the Nation's defense in the most economical and efficient ways possible. This involves managing 334,000 prime contracts valued at approximately $1.2 Trillion.</p>
<p>DCMA is headquartered in Ft Lee, Virginia and currently employs approximately 10,500 civilian and <br />military professionals worldwide. DCMA consists of over 50 Contract Management Offices (CMOs) with over 800 employee duty stations worldwide, working with over 19,000 defense related firms.</p>
<p>PURPOSE OF THE RFI</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to gather market information pertaining to SharePoint based records management systems that are currently certified as 5015.2 compliant by the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) or may become certified by March of 2016. DCMA seeks a solution that operates solely on existing SharePoint hardware and integrates seamlessly with SharePoint capabilities. Additionally, the desired solution must extend 5015.2 compliant records management to the agency's Microsoft Outlook E-mail system to meet National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) records management directives and provide supporting governance necessary to effectively implement compliant records management of SharePoint sites and records.<br />As a result of the information gained from this RFI, DCMA may request demonstrations of specific products and conduct follow-on validation and integration testing with IWMS components in an Innovation Lab (iLab) environment. The purpose of the iLab testing would be to: determine the solution's viability to replace HP Trim; implement 5015.2 compliant records management of MS Outlook E-mails, and assess the product's ability to provide SharePoint site governance in support of records management. Additionally, the level of effort required to integrate the solution into the agency's "to be" information technology architecture would be assessed.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI will be reviewed by DCMA for their applicability to the Government's need and determined to be "Relevant" or "Irrelevant" to the above requirement. Offerors of "Relevant" responses may be requested to demonstrate their approach/product, answer technical questions or provide limited assistance in support of iLAB evaluations to help DCMA determine product capabilities, identify integration issues and the overall viability of the product to satisfy DCMA's 5015.2 SharePoint based records management requirement.</p>

<DESC>The Robley Rex VA Medical Center in Louisville, Kentucky has a requirement for construction services for Project 603-15-102, Replace Faade Phase II.  The intent of this project is to make repairs to the exterior faade of buildings #1,3,4,5 and 6.  Building 1, an eleven story tall structure, partially restored in 2012 has multiple points of failure in the faade including cracked cast stone and brickwork, failed mortar joints, corroded lintels, and failed joint sealant.  The remaining buildings (3,4,5 and 6) have similar exterior conditions.  These buildings were built in the early 1950's with brick veneer that laced weep ports and did not account for differential expansion which has attributed to failures.  Failures in the cast stone are the result of corrosion of underlying rebar.  These repairs are needed to restore the integrity of the building' envelope.
This requirement is a 100% set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 8127 (d).  Verification of veteran status will be checked both following the submission of bids, as well as prior to award.  Eligible contractors must also have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM).
The estimated range of construction costs for this project is between $2,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.
The solicitation for this project will be issued on or before January 28, 2016.
This requirement will be procured in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 14 and 36, as a Seal Bid, with the guidance for contracting Construction.
All Bidders shall be advised that for the purpose of determining responsibility in accordance with FAR 9.104-2, the successful bidder must also be able to demonstrate through verification by the Contracting Officer, successful past performance and experience in performing masonry work over the past five (5) years.  The Contracting Officer will utilize a variety of means of verifying successful past performance of similar work.  Failure of the contractor to provide this information, falsification of information, and/or ambiguous performance information may result in the Contracting Officer requiring the contractor to obtain a Certificate of Competency from the U.S. Small Business Administration.  The contractor must also provide evidence of an experience modification rating (EMR) of less than one (1) prior to award.
Failure or the inability of the contractor to be determined responsible may result in the award going to the next lowest bidder, pending the same determination.

William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home National Historic Site

Statement of Need

The historic Cassidy House at William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home National Historic Site (Birthplace) was damaged due to fire during the early morning hours of December 25, 2015. The local fire department quickly responded and extinguished the fire. There is fire, water, and smoke damage to the house.

The Cassidy House is located at 117 South Hervey Street, Hope, Arkansas, approximately 110 miles southwest of Little Rock, Arkansas. The Cassidy House was constructed in 1917 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is a two-story wood-framed structure and is an example of the American Foursquare type of building. The two stories are approximately 2,852 square feet. There is an attic. The house does not have a basement, but is raised above a crawl space that is accessible from two exterior hatches. There is asbestos on a water heater tank liner in the kitchen of the house. And although the house was abated of lead based coatings in 1995-1996, it was not comprehensive and lead paint was documented in concentrations greater than 5,000 ppm multiple locations in 2013.

The house is set up as a historic house museum for public tours with exhibited period furnishings consisting of upholstered furniture, wood furniture, tables, chairs, chest of drawers, framed pictures, linens, books, magazines, photos, kitchen wares, rugs, glassware, China, draperies, knick-knacks, kitchen appliances, lamps, clothing, mattress sets, pillows, vinyl records, etc. There are approximately 850 museum items displayed in the house.

As a result of the fire the interior of the house and all the furnishings are covered in a fine layer of soot and have a strong odor of the fire. The acidic nature of the soot causes discoloration, corrosion, and overall damage. There is a potential for mold growth due to water used to extinguish the fire. 

This statement is seeking proposals to clean all of the furnishings (all sides/surfaces/interiors, etc.), textiles, objects (all sides/surfaces/interiors, etc.), and interior of house (walls, ceilings, floors, fixtures, etc.) of the house to pre-fire condition. Proposal must include list of chemicals that will be used to treat for mold, reduce the smell, clean items, and chemicals used to eliminate the smoke odor for prior review and approval. Any observed damage to furnishings must be noted, for example, the high temperatures of fires can melt adhesives or plastics. Films and tapes inside containers can be much more damaged than it appears from a cursory glance of the container itself. Any loose or removed architectural features are to be collected  nothing will be thrown out. 

Work will result in all items on exhibit in the house are cleaned to pre-fire condition with no soot residue present. Interior spaces of house like walls, ceilings, floor, fixtures, appliances, etc. are cleaned with no soot residue present. Smoke odor is eliminated and an EPAs air quality index of 0-50 for particle pollution. Mold is eliminated and will not appear within 6 months of completion of contract.

<DESC>Amendment 3: Contractor Questions that were answered in Amendments 1 & 2 could not be seen in their entirety in FedConnect.  This amendment corrects this problem.  Also, this amendment extends the due date of this RFI to January 12, 2016 @ 12:00 EST. 

1. Q: Are there requirements for managing unstructured (Big) data? A: No.

2. Q: Are there any specific high availability requirements? (e.g., system must maintain 99.999% availability through the year, require automatic failover between nodes, must replicate all data, binaries, configurations to a remote site for disaster recovery). A: No.

3. Q: Is the data from the instruments transferred to the database in real-time data streams? (vs manual load, batch process, etc.). A: No.

4. Q: I'm inquiring about the Front-end capabilities requested in this RFI. The Oracle database application does have a generic UI interface associated with it. My assumption is that EPA region 7 might not be satisfied with this or is seeking specific capabilities/functionalities associated with an updated front-end user interface. Is this accurate? If so, can you provide some guidance about what type of capability or functionality EPA is expecting from the front-end UI? I feel the RFI does not address this. It would be great to speak with the end user to really get a sense of what they'd like to have in an updated Front-end user interface.
A: No User Interface requirements have been included in this RFI.

5. Q: The RFI states: The STC currently has a locally-developed Oracle database application that the Region 7 laboratory uses to manage environmental laboratory information. What technology was used to develop this application? Oracle Forms and Reports? Application Express? Other? A: Primarily Oracle Forms and Reports version 6. Some third party add-ins used to handle PDF generation, email, and MS Office integration. Extensive use of Oracle stored procedures and/or database triggers.

6. Q: The RFI states: About 200 forms and reports are needed as the front-end of this system. Do you already have 200 forms and reports or do you need 200 forms and reports developed as the front-end of this system? A: We already have 200 forms and reports in production, but assume that none of them will be usable in the new system.

7. Q: The RFI states: In general terms, describe the solution your company would recommend for a front-end solution for the Promium database (commercially available database). A: Ok.

8. Q: Does STC currently use Promium solutions? If so, what is the back-end Promium database (for example: Oracle, MS SQL, Access, proprietary, etc)? A: No, the STC does not currently use Promium solutions.

9. Q: Can you give examples of the functionality of a front-end solution? A: Yes, but have been instructed not to provide this information as part of the RFI process.

<AWARDEE>West Publishing Corporation, 610 OPPERMAN DR, Eagan, MN 55123 US
<DESC>This BPA has been awarded based on limited sources justification below. <br /><br />1 NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING APPROVED: <br />Investigative and Enforcement Service (IES) is the investigative and enforcement arm for the programs under the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Investigators are responsible for investigation related to the enforcement of the rules and regulation under the purview of APHIS in all 50 states and the US territories.
<p>The primary purpose of the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Workers' Compensation Program (WCP) is to facilitate wage replacement, payment for medical care, and return to work efforts for employees who sustain compensable work injuries. The WCP staff works with the Department of Labor (DOL), Office of Workers' Compensation Program (OWCP) who administers the federal program according to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act. Additionally, our staff works with supervisors and employees to ensure accountability and the timely processing of OWCP claims, and provides guidance in navigating regulation and policy.</p>
<p>The Security Branch (SB) is the entity within USDA-APHIS responsible for investigating, assessing, and mitigating threats to agency facilities and personnel. All programs within the agency report internal and external threats, as well as other security incidents, to the Security Branch. Once the Security Branch receives an initial report, a Security Specialist conducts a threat assessment to determine the nature, severity, and potential mitigation of the incident.<br />Accurate and timely information is paramount to the three programs. To that end, access to third party databases is required for information gathering and validation. Accurate and timely access to this important information is vital in carrying out each programs missions and goals. <br /><br />2 DESCRIPTION OF THE SERVICE/SUBSCRIPTION REQUIRED TO MEET AGERNCY NEED:<br />CLEAR Investigator Database<br />The CLEAR public records data will provide information on locating persons, assets, verifying identities, identifying businesses and business affiliations, and identifying adverse information. Real-time gateways and locator data is provided at no additional cost. The gateway provides real-time access to ensure information obtained is up-to-date. This includes access to credit header data, vehicle registration data, and phone data-including cell phones. Live gateways also provides locator data to obtain the most current address available. These records are searchable and users are able to save customized searches and reports. The ability for users to order reports and customizing those reports is a necessity.</p>
<p>Users have the ability to save report in an Adobe pdf and Microsoft Word format. We require the ability to run all four report types: contact report, basic report, national comprehensive report, and business comprehensive report. The sections of each report should provide the ability to customize prior to saving. User is able to export results to IBM i2 Analyst Notebook for further analysis. Users have access to query history, session summary, and the ability to export search results to Microsoft Excel. The user is able to create alerts for subjects of a Person Search.</p>
<p>The Public Record Data Sets allows searches to be bundled into broad search types:<br />&bull; Person<br />&bull; Business<br />&bull; Asset<br />&bull; Phone<br />&bull; License<br />&bull; Court</p>
<p>Premium Content <br />Users will also require access to the following premium content for specialized searching:<br />&bull; Web Analytics - This service provides access to multiple resources including social networking sites, news services, and blog entries. Web Analytics provides information not normally found in public records including photos and email addresses, and business affiliations.<br />&bull; Real-Time Incarceration and Arrest Records - provides access to booking records and photo images. This includes 36 states and the District of Columbia.<br />&bull; Healthcare Fraud Content - Provides access to healthcare provider content, including NPI numbers, state and federal sanctions, and expanded professional licenses - across all states.<br />The total amount for unlimited subscription of CLEAR database and premium contents is approximately $185,000 for a total of 5 years. <br /><br />3. IDENTIFICATION OF THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING NONCOMPETITIVE ACQUISITIONS: <br />FAR 8.405-6 (a)(1)(i)(B) Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.</p>
<p>4. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE SERVICE/SUBSCRIPTION AND THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED:<br />The refresh rates and diversity of data sources is paramount to providing actionable information. We rely heavily on our information validation protocol to that end. CLEAR provides different information sources than Lexis.com, Lexis Investigative Portal, Accurint, and PeopleMap. Their refresh rate is better for some information and their cell phone, employer data, Secretary of States data, social media and Canadian telephone information is more comprehensive than that provided by its competitors. Even though all the subscription may provide people information or business information the source that they get that information from and the refresh rate makes the difference. If we are looking for cell phone information CLEAR is one of the best sources for that, if it is address information than CLEAR will pick that information up first because of its use of credit reporting data. These are only a few of the difference.</p>
<p>Here are some of the data areas that CLEAR provides that other databases did not offer:</p>
<p>&bull; Web Analytics- This service provides access to multiple resources including social networking sites, news services, and blog entries. Web Analytics provides information not normally found in public records including photos and email addresses, and business affiliations.<br />&bull; Real-Time Incarceration and Arrest Records - provides access to booking records and photo images. This includes 36 states and the District of Columbia.<br />&bull; Telephone information for Canadian residence and businesses.<br />&bull; Employment data<br />&bull; Ability to export results to Microsoft Excel<br />&bull; Ability to set alert to notify analyst when information changes for a specified entity.</p>
<p>CLEAR is an important tool in our toolbox and necessary to providing actionable information to or investigators and enforcement staff. Based on CLEAR's unique nature, we have determined that West Publishing Corp. is the only capable source that can provide services required at the level of quality required.</p>
<p>5.A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MAKE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTIABLE, INCLUDING WHETHER A NOTICE WAS OR WILL BE PUBLIZED AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR) SUBPART 5.2 AND IF NOT, WHICH EXCEPTIONS UNDER FAR 5.202 APPLIES:<br />We elevated 5 different data subscriptions and as their data availability changes we must reevaluate the merit of the data provided.</p>
<p>6.A DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICIER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE, AND THE BASIS FOR THAT DETERMINATION. <br />Determination of fair and reasonable pricing will be based on historical pricing and price comparisons to other data subscriptions contractors. In the previous contract with West Publishing Corporation for CLEAR services, the USDA paid approximately $158 per user monthly with an annual increase of approximately $8 for a total of 11 users.</p>
<p>This new requirement is for 17 users with additional service requirements. With that being said each program (WCP, SB, and IES) is paying around $158 to $268 per user monthly - depending on the user content access - with an annual increase of approximately $6 to $9 per user. As mentioned in Part 6, we evaluated 5 different data subscriptions and West Publishing Corp. has the best value. By bundling the requirements of these three programs the government is saving money on services and on long term administrative cost. Furthermore, GSA has already determined the prices of supplies and fixed-price services under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable (FAR 8.404).</p>

The exact nature and extent of the work covered by this contract, as well as the precise methodology of performing the work, cannot be reasonably established far enough in advance. In addition, the cost of performing the work under this type of contract cannot be established in advance or accurately forecast with the adequacy or accuracy to permit award of a fixed price contract. Therefore, a contract type that is flexible in nature and can change as the work progresses is considered appropriate and in the best interest of the Government for this procurement.</span></p>

RFQ number HSCG38-16-Q-300004 is assigned for tracking purposes only. This is a notice of the Government&rsquo;s intent to award one (1) order with firm-fixed prices to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Northrop Grumman Corporation ESSD of Linthicum Heights, MD on a sole source basis for the repair of Antenna Control GRO PN 788R330G01, one (1) each. The Antenna Control GRO is a commercial item IAW FAR 2.101 and is used on the Coast Guard&rsquo;s HC-130J aircraft. Period of Performance will begin at award through delivery. Set Aside: Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, under the authority of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), 41 U.S.C 2304(d)(1)(B). The Contracting Officer has determined that there is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or more responsible small business concerns; therefore the small business set-aside is dissolved. This requirement is unrestricted. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or quotation which will be considered by the agency. Interested parties are advised that the minimum qualifying standard for technical acceptability is the possession of an OEM license to perform the work. Anticipated date of award: On or about November 13, 2015
