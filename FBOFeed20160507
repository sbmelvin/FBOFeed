<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) and Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) plans to procure on a sole source basis a series of meeting rooms during the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2014 Annual Meeting from Hilton Hotels Chicago, 720 South Michigan Avenue, Chicago, IL 60605.
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>

<p>Period of performance is June 2, 2016 through June 6, 2016.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The mission of CTEP is to improve the lives of cancer patients by finding better ways to treat, control and cure cancer. CTEP accomplishes this mission by funding an extensive national program of cancer research and by sponsoring clinical trials to evaluate new anti-cancer agents, with a particular emphasis on translational research to elucidate molecular targets and mechanisms of drug effects. CTEP attempts to forge broad collaborations, including international collaborations. CTEP supports NCI clinical research via networks specializing in both early and late phase clinical trials conducted with the extramural community and industry partners. The ASCO Annual Meeting brings together more than 25,000 oncology professionals from a broad range of specialties from North America as well as the rest of the world, making it an excellent venue for CTEP program staff overseeing NCI-supported clinical trials to meet and discuss the latest clinical research findings in cancer. The venue of meetings at ASCO allows an unparalleled opportunity for NCI staff to address key issues affecting NCI programs and to make decisions regarding strategy, prioritization of research questions, and study operations related to ongoing and future clinical trials in a timely manner, especially with respect to late breaking research presented at the annual meeting.</p>
<p>The proposed vendor is asked to provide a series of conference rooms between the hours of 3:00 PM and 9:00 PM, Thursday, June 2, 2016; and 6:00 AM - 9:00 PM Friday, June 3, 2016 through Monday, June 6, 2016. The vendor shall provide a complete audiovisual package, electrical package and communications package for each room.</p>
<p>CTEP is required to use the meeting space, Hilton Corporation Chicago assigned by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) organization. Ancillary Function Meeting Space requested during the ASCO 2016 Annual Meeting has to be requested and approved by the ASCO organization. Once the request is approved ASCP assigns the hotel meeting space.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested parties, especially small businesses, believe they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.
