<DESC>The Government intends to contract on a SOLE SOURCE basis, under the Authority of FAR Part 13, with HYDRA-BRAKE, DBA Industrial Engineering Company, at SWEDESBORO, NEW JERSEY 08085 to overhaul one (1) Dynamometer Model Number C9510-1 that was originally manufactured by Industrial Engineering 27 years prior. The  Dynamometer is used for running the T-63 engine lubricant testing to evaluate associated engine lubricants.  Hydra-Brake (Industrial Engineering), as the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), maintains the proprietary data required to perform repairs and overhaul on this equipment. This requirement is urgent as failure of this dynamometer can lead to a catastrophic engine failure, therefore, proper dynamometer overhaul maintenance is critical.  This effort will include inspection and overhaul of typical wear parts such as bearings and seals, and inspection and recommendation for other replacement parts if found needed to return the equipment to like new condition.  

The Federal Supply Code for this procurement is 3829 and North American Industry Classification System is 334519.

No Request for Proposal (RFP) is available for competitive bidding; however, interested parties may submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement, to include descriptive literature, by the closing date of this announcement to the contact person listed in this advertisement.  

Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Rural Development and Farm Services Agency (Agency) intends to negotiate and award a combination Fixed Price and Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract using a negotiated Request for Proposal for technical support services to provide maintenance support and enhancement development for the Guaranteed Loan System (GLS), while continuing to develop component-based processes where deemed feasible.

The Agency, as part of supporting its overall role in providing agricultural credit and rural development assistance, has initiated activities to develop and enhance Agency information management.  The continued shift from internal Agency automated systems used by USDA employees to a combination of internal, intranet and internet systems serving our varied customers mandates improved and responsive automation support.  The Agency direct loan and grant and guaranteed loan initiatives have many constituents including: USDA and Agency executive management, Agency Program Management (Farm Service Agency Farm Programs, Rural Housing Service Programs, Rural Business Cooperative Service Programs, and Rural Utilities Services Programs), Agency servicing offices, the Agency finance offices, private sector lending institutions, customers, and potential customers.  Each of these constituents has both common and unique information needs.

Each of the Agency program management constituents uses both direct and guaranteed loans in the execution of their program activities.  The current automated Guaranteed Loan System (GLS), Program Loan Accounting System (PLAS), Automated Multi-Housing Accounting System (AMAS), Multi-Family Information System (MFIS), Dedicated Loan Origination System (DLOS), and Rural Utilities Loan Servicing System (RULSS) are components which interface, exchange data, and use certain common processes.  Our external constituents including lending institutions, customers, and potential customers have different informational and servicing needs than our internal constituents.  With mandated E-Government initiatives, our existing legacy components must be enhanced to allow all constituents the necessary access to information and the functionality to more efficiently implement our loan programs. Additionally, the Agency direct and grant and guaranteed loan program automated components must comply with OMB Circular A-129 performance goals, the Treasury Financial Manual, Circular A-123 guidance for internal control systems, Circular A-127 guidance for financial management systems, and Circular A-130 guidance for security requirements.  Consideration must also be given to the JFMIP Government-Wide systems automation requirements and the E-File/GPEA initiatives.

The various automated components, which support the Agency loan programs, are at different stages of development effort in an attempt to meet E-File/GPEA mandates.  The architecture of these components is evolving from a pure block-mode, mainframe environment to one of web-enabled intranet, extranet, and internet capabilities interfacing with some legacy processes.  Common processes are being shared between programs to reduce maintenance overhead where feasible.  All new development is aimed at re-usability among programs.

We have multiple tools being used in the development of our Agency financial and management systems.  Computer Associates CA:Gen is being used to model and generate DB2 and Oracle databases and to develop database server components.  JBuilder is being used in conjunction with an Oracle database as well as being used for some other component development.  COBOL is used for most batch processing development.  CA:GEN-ESP is utilized by GLS for job scheduling.

The web architecture includes Microsoft IIS servers, TCPI direct and SNA server communicating with an OS-390 mainframe DB2 data server.  Microsoft Visual Studio, JBuilder, WEBSphere, Tomcat, and Cold Fusion are being utilized to develop active server pages and Java server pages.  JavaScript, VBScript, and JavaBeans are being used as client and server side script languages.  Visual Source Safe is used for configuration management and version control.  The choice of tool set and architecture will be determined by the Agency using the suite of tools approved by the Agency.

This solicitation is directed toward the continuance of implementing enhancements to the automated components that support the direct loan and grant and guaranteed loan programs within the Rural Development and Farm Service Agencies to carry out continuous process improvements to their automation development, keeping in mind the overall goal of creating components that support multiple programs. The tasks developed under this solicitation/contract will utilize the development infrastructure, standards, and guidelines established by the Agency.

The Agency requires technical support and assistance to implement enhancements to the automated components that support the direct loan and grant and guaranteed loan programs within the Rural Development and Farm Service Agencies using the appropriate tool set based on the architecture of the component.  The Agency requires continued support to implement and institutionalize component based development and the re-use of methodology supported by Agency approved development tools.   The Agency requires this support to create/procure automated components that will provide the means for loan program business to efficiently operate and manage activities, including accounting and control; external reporting (i.e., USDA and OMB); and program outreach to support external customer and potential customer needs. 

The Model Based Development methodology supported by approved Agency development set of tools (which include Computer Associates CA:Gen, Microsoft Visual Studio, JBuilder, WEBSphere, Tomcat, Cold Fusion, JavaScript, VBScript, and Visual Source Safe) shall be used to understand and document the business, strengthen the partnership between business and technical staff, identify opportunities for business process improvements, develop quality automated systems with reusable components, improve front-line worker ability to carry out job responsibilities, enable improved customer service, facilitate timely and responsive information access by customers and management, and institute a basis for continuous process improvements within the Agency loan program businesses.

The contract will be awarded for one (1) base year with four (4) option years to be exercised by the Government if found to be in its best interest.  This contract will include two sections: a firm fixed price section and an IDIQ Section for which firm fixed price Task Orders will be issued based on hourly rates proposed.  

The approximate solicitation release date is July 25, 2007.  The solicitation will be available and distributed solely through the Federal Business Opportunities website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. The site provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation/amendments will be disturbed solely through the website listed.

If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

<DESC>The principal goal of this contract is to evaluate the extent to which the Library?s Office of Contracts (not FEDLINK) conforms to applicable federal regulations and guidance in its acquisition contracts for goods and services.  Regulations and guidance in this context include the FAR, the Federal Information Resources Management Regulation, other applicable federal acquisition criteria such as LCRs, to the extent these promulgate the FAR (i.e., LCRs 2110, 2111, and 2112).  The evaluation will be twofold:  
1.	An evaluation of the extent to which internal policies conform to the FAR and other applicable authorities, and
2.	A detailed assessment of a sample selected using standard statistical sampling methodology of contracts and related contract material?not inter-agency agreements, grants, purchase cards, or cooperative agreements?on which a fair and objective opinion can be formed regarding the Library?s technical conformance to applicable policy.  The sample will be selected from the population of Library contract actions over $25,000 taken during fiscal year 2006.  The Library issued approximately 5,800 contractual actions over $25,000 in fiscal 2006.

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center - Training Systems Division (NAWC-TSD) has a requirement to provide curriculum and courseware support for the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA). The CNATRA mission is to train Pilots, Undergraduate Military Flight Officers (UMFOs) and Enlisted Air Crewmen for the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), as well as several foreign countries, through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.  The overall goal / objective is to produce military qualified aviators that meet the skill requirements of a diverse client base optimized to a production and completion schedule that integrates with customer demand. The Assistant Chief of Staff (ACOS) for Aviation Training and Standardization, CNATRA N7, is tasked with a continuing requirement to maintain the currency, efficiency and effectiveness of all curricular materials.  This tasking requires the continual update, modification, amendment, enhancement and standardization of approximately 30% or less of all aviation training curricula, courseware and instructional support materials.  In addition, this N7 tasking includes management, organizational support, labor, equipment, training facilities, tools, training devices, supervision and other services necessary to support all Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM) classroom, simulator, and flight training programs, to include extensive on-site support at the locations identified below. Located at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas, the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) oversees the Naval Air Training Command (NATRACOM), which includes five Training Air Wings located on five Naval Air Stations in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas.  The five wings are home to 17 Training Squadrons.  In addition, Joint Services Training (JST) is also conducted with the Air Force on bases in Georgia, Oklahoma, and Texas.  There are six NATRACOM locations that support the primary mission of the CNATRA, including the N7 centrally managed Flight Training Support Center (FTSC). NATRACOM squadrons log approximately 400,000 flight hours each year in seven types of training aircraft/platforms with a total compliment of over 750 airplanes.  More than 1,800 pilots and Naval Flight Officers (NFOs) earn their Wings of Gold from the NATRACOM annually.  These six NATRACOM locations include:

CNATRA N7  Flight Training Support Center (FTSC), NAS Corpus Christi, TX
Training Air Wing One, NAS Meridian, MS
Training Air Wing Two, NAS Kingsville, TX
Training Air Wing Four, NAS Corpus Christi, TX
Training Air Wing five, NAS Whiting Field, FL
Training Air Wing Six, NAS Pensacola, FL

This effort is to provide direct support for all NATRACOM curricula, courseware, and training materials, centrally managed and maintained by the Flight Training Support Center (FTSC), satisfying the Command's aviation training requirements within a well timed, efficient, and accurate corporate continuum.  The FTSC is composed of the Operational Support Segment (OSS), which includes Training Integration Management System (TIMS) product development, the Curriculum and Courseware Support Segment (CSS), and the Configuration Management and Quality Control Support Segment (CM/QC-SS); all Support Segments are dedicated to direct operational/functional training support.  The FTSC Support Segments are critical elements of the NATRACOM training environment and crucial to primary mission objectives.  Present course material is undergoing conversion to Authorware 7.0. The Contractor shall deliver to the Government all source data, training products, courseware, publicatons, software, hardware, documentation, data rights, and operating licenses procured / developed for, or incidental to, this Contract effort.  This total effort involves roughly 29 aviation curricula, 825+ Computer Based Training (CBT) lessons, and approximately 135 aviation training technical documents/publications.  Contractor activities will include the design, development, changes, revision ( 30 to 50% or less ) and maintenance, conversion, testing, documentation, training, deployment, establishing and tracking the inter-dependent relationships and operational support of all CNATRA Headquarters and NATRACOM aviation training curricula, courseware, and training materials/publications.  This requirement also includes: Instructional System Design (ISD); courseware authoring; technical publication support; program/project management; configuration management and quality control; and data management. 

In addition, the contractor shall provide process-engineering support that is focused on a continuous process improvement that increases the quality of the product and services provided to the CNATRA and NATRACOM customer base. The selected contractor must be able to comply with Capability Maturity Model Integrated (CMMI)-Level 3.  A critical element of the CNATRA corporate business process, which includes the contract work-force, is effective utilization and implementation of Operational Risk Management (ORM).  Structurally, the NATRACOM and CNATRA staff utilize microcomputer based client server technology hardware, software and network to support current and future requirements. The Government intends to conduct a competitive acquisition under the 8(a) Program per FAR SubPart 19.8.  The resultant contract is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with a five year ordering period with both Fixed Price and Cost contract type elements.  The Government further anticipates a $40M contract over a 60-month period. Detailed requirements for specific tasks will be issued as task/delivery orders for a task or combination of tasks under the contract. It is anticipated that the contracted effort will take the form of a combination SOO/SOW, with written proposals supported by an oral component.  A secret clearance is required to work on this project.  Personnel qualifications ? the Government requires the contractor to provide highly skilled and experienced professional personnel in several specific disciplines for technical roles.  8(a) businesses capable of accomplishing the required effort, within the NAICS code 541511 are invited to participate in this competitive procurement.  Teaming and/or Joint Ventures are also encouraged. Solicitation number N61339-07-R-0057 has been assigned to this procurement.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a broad (approximately 9 cm in diameter) monoenergetic, monodirectional ion source that is capable of producing 1 eV to well above 30,000 eV ions with a current density ranging from approximately 1x10-14  Amps/cm2 to  1x10-8 Amps/cm2.   Presently in the Low Energy Electron and Ion Facility (LEEIF), ions of energy 0.6  2600 eV are produced in an electron bombardment ion source with an effective circular aperture of approximately 9.0 cm diameter. A tandem electrostatic and variable geometry magnetic mirror configuration within the ion source optimizes the use of the ionizing electrons, thus decreasing the gas and non-thermal electron throughput to the instrument chamber while improving the flux uniformity. Each controlled voltage decade has 12 bit resolution: 0-30V, 30V-300 V, 300 V-3000 V.  The beam is imaged to the plane of the admittance aperture of the instrument.	The usable current density is approximately 1pA/cm2 at beam energies as low as 1 eV, with higher values, up to 1x10-10 A/cm2 , available with increasing energy.  The beam energy spread is typically less than 0.3 eV and the average angular divergence is approximately 0.75.   Photographs, a few assembly drawings, and the electrical wiring schematics of the ion source assembly are available.  We now have calibration requirements to expand the energy capability of the LEEIF ion source from 1eV to 40 keV energies.  With that in mind, we are requesting a 1 eV to well above 30 keV ion source that is capable of providing final calibration level measurements for particle detectors before flight.  This requires an ion source of a similar design ranging in voltages from less than 1 V to above 30 kV that is also spatially broad, mono-energetic, mono-directional, and with the required current density levels.  Our objective is to provide one ion source that is of calibration level for flight instrumentation.  The resulting ion source specifications are: 1. Energies ranging from below 1 eV to well above 30 keV, voltage allowance to accommodate energies of  less than 1 eV to well above 30 keV. 2. An effective circular aperture of approximately 9 cm in diameter or greater 3. Well-collimated and a spatially broad beam from point of extraction to instrument aperture, present ion source diameter stated above. 4. Monoenergetic (i.e. small temperature spread), monodirectional (i.e. small trajectory angles) 5. Appropriate flux levels for instruments for lunar, heliospheric and geospace missions.  Current densities ranging from 1x10-14 Amps/cm2 to 1x10-8 Amps/cm2 6. Connection allowance for each voltage or current controlled element in the ion source and for feedback control of absolute beam current 7. Ion source elements similar to our present design including a variable magnetic mirror configuration 8. Allowance for large power capability to filament NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Colorado State University because they have (A) extensive knowledge of different type of ion sources including low temperature sources and high-energy particle sources.  They have (B) extensive experience in solutions for sputtering and arcing problems that are inherent to the high voltage side of this source. The lead time for this requirement is 6-months. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control, NIOSH, Cincinnati, OH has a requirement for analysis of disease rates and costs for selected diseases, preparation of reports, and recommendations for prevention. The goal is to provide useful information to employers that will identify prevention opportunities and to indicate need for further investigation of associations between particular industries and health conditions. Highmark, Inc. is the only known health insurer in the United States who has developed the capability of calculating specific disease rates by detailed industry and who is prepared to convey this information to employers along with recommendations for prevention. NIOSH has been working with Independence Blue Cross for approximately two years for the same purposes. This additional work will expand the scope of data utilized and develop reports to employers in order to accomplish the fundamental objectives of the project and demonstrate a new model of occupational health tracking. The government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Independence Blue Cross because no other insurer is known that has begun this process and is prepared to produce the data, analysis and reports detailed in the purchase order within the time period beginning September 1, 2007 through March 1, 2009. Independence Blue Cross has the needed data and will also be able to contribute types of information to the desired databases that will substantially improve the quality of industry disease rate analysis for the entire project. Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer with 15 days from the posting date of this notice their written specifications and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please submit capabilities and supporting information to Jennifer Bayer, REFERENCE: 000HCCKD-2007-46212, NIOSH, 4676 Columbia Parkway, Cincinnati, Ohio 45226, Mail Stop C-4. The Government shall review all information submitted and determine if other qualified sources could perform the effort. Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, per FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be on a sole source basis conducted for the Independence Blue Cross as the only source meeting our needs and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Ceramics Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Insync, Inc, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, for the purchase of a Harmonic Rejection Mirror for use at the NIST beamlines at the National Synchrotron Light Source.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  NIST currently uses the Harmonic Rejection Mirror (HRM) at the NIST beamlines at the National Synchrotron Light Source.  The range of energy over which the HRM needs to function, for NIST?s purposes, dictates that it needs to be a rectangular shape of length greater than 500 mm, and a reflection coating of 1000 A thick.  The aspect ratio of the mirror is compatible with NIST?s existing gas-purged housing unit.  At a synchrotron beamline, the radiation damage of optical equipment can be significant.  NIST requires the HRM to be produced on single-crystal Si substrate, which has much greater resistance to radiation damage.  As a result, Insync, Inc., is uniquely qualified to provide the required Harmonic Rejection Mirror.  Insync, Inc., is the sole manufacturer and distributor of these mirrors.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by August 6, 2007, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition Procedures the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Core Genotyping Facility (CGF) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave., Seattle, WA  98109 to provide 5904 DNA samples from the Women?s Health Initiative (WHI) conducted under a contract form the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).  The goal of the CGF is to meet the genotyping and DNA sequencing needs of the NCI.  The facility performs high-throughput genotyping and sequencing to support genetic analysis for a broad range of projects for the intramural research program of the NCI.  The Cancer Genetic Marker of Susceptibility (CGEMS) project represents a three-year NCI enterprise initiative coordinated through Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) and the NCI Office for Cancer Genomics (OCG).  The projection is for whole genome scans that target approximately 500,000 or more Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers across the entire human genome assayed in two sets of 1,200 cases each with prostate and breast cancer and 1,200 well-matched controls.  For each cancer site, breast and prostate cancer, a whole genome scan will be followed by four additional replication studies of larger size for sequential validation of findings.  In order for CGF to accomplish their goals in the aggressive timeline required by the NCI, the CGEMS project is relying on DNA samples from existing studies with previously collected samples that include epidemiological documentation specific to the CGEMS initiative.  The Women?s Health Initiative study is able to provide 6,000 well matched breast cancer cases and controls collected over a fifteen year period.  This extremely large collection of well-matched breast cancer case and control DNA is not accessible from any other organization and is being requested by CGF for inclusion in the CGEMS breast cancer phase(s) of the project. This unique collection of samples is specific to the needs of the CGEMS initiative and the size of the study contributes significantly to the scientific power required for the sequential validation of findings that will be pursued in the replication phase(s) of the CGEMS project and provides an opportunity for future replication studies given the follow-up phases of the study that are planned until 2010.  The WHI Clinical Coordinating Center is located at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) and has contractual responsibilities that include maintaining the WHI biological repository.  The WHI Program Office at NHLBI and the WHI Study Group has authorized the WHI Clinical Coordinating at the FHCRC to serve as WHI representative for delivery of the DNA samples.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the requirement as detailed they may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EDT, on August 7, 2007.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and must be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor?s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov    In addition; contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

A3) Three

Q4) Will the software applications that currently are in use on www.ehpoline.org transfer to the new contractor? That is, e-commerce.

Q6) Is the artwork for the cover typically purchased by the contractor? 

A6)  Yes.

Q7) Will the contractor print the journal or does the printing take place under GPO?

Q13) How are the subscriber and complimentary copies mailed? Periodical rate or standard rate?  

A13)  Complimentary copies are mailed in-house by Government staff.  Subscriber copies are currently mailed by the printer at periodical rate.  
 
Q14) Modification 01 states that "NIEHS anticipates utilizing Scholar One for the manuscript management system described in the STATED OBJECTIVE and Task 1 of the Performance Work Statement." Please can you confirm that it is not a requirement that bidders provide this particular system for EHP, i.e., NIEHS is open to considering other systems?

Q15) On page 43, under Estimate of Effort (Section L.1.e), the Government has provided the approximate labor hours that may be necessary at 12,480 labor hours.  This is the same number of labor hours estimated for the project under the earlier cancelled solicitation.  However, the scope of work is expanded somewhat from the earlier solicitation (i.e., the news section, which was reduced to 10 pages in the earlier solicitation is now full length).  Was the decision to leave the labor hours recommendation unchanged a carefully considered one?  If so, should offerors assume that revised processes should be put in place to fit the scope as closely to the recommended level as possible? If not, do you have a revised suggested labor level, or should the contractor adjust accordingly based on the revised scope statement?  
Any clarification you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

A15) 12,480 labor hours remain unchanged as carefully considered
 
Q16) Does the Government desire a standard journal length of 228 pages (including covers) for purposes of pricing? In the PWS, on page 4, under Task 4, it is indicated that the April 2007 edition was 228 pages. In addition, in optional services, the Government asks for up to 228 pages of copyediting.  However, back on page 4 it also indicates that the journal "typically ran three 4-color signatures and three 2-color (black and cyan) signatures per issue."  That adds up to 192 pages (plus covers).  If 228 is desired, that would simply be one additional signature.  Should we assume that additional signature will be 4-color or 2-color for pricing purposes?

A16) The journal will be 228 pages (including covers) for purposes of pricing.  The additional signature may be 2- or 4-signature depending on content.  Price on both please.

Q17)  Does NIEHS have plans to add editorial staff?

A17)  The NIEHS does not anticipate adding additional editorial staff to the resulting contract.  If appropriate, the contract will be modified to incorporate additional editorial staff.

<RESPDATE>080807
<CONTACT>Kenneth Carter, (202) 267-3012
<DESC>Modification to incorporate revised Section J.1 attachment, dated 7/19/07.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes to issue a requirement for the acquisition of a DC BUS (Back-Up-System) capable of suppressing transient voltage conditions.  The system shall continuously supply regulated Direct Current (DC) power to loads and shall be capable of providing power during loss or interruption of input Alternating Current (AC) by using energy stored in a battery bank. The requirement is being considered for an Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) consisting of a one-year base period and four one-year options periods.       The DC BUS System proposed under this requirement consists of Commercial-off-the- Shelf/Non-Developmental Item equipments containing the following: 	Rectifiers; distribution cabinets; distribution panels; inverters; remote monitor capability; control panel; AC wireway; DC wireway; battery shunt, a main system bus, battery disconnect panel; and a valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) battery, with a capacity of 530 - 2100 Amp hours. 	There is an optional component list consisting of a converter; distribution panel; and low voltage-disconnect contactor. 	Other environmental requirements include -  o	Storage ambient temperatures ranging from -20C to 70C o	Operating ambient temperatures ranging from 0C to 40C o	Operating ambient temperature batteries ranging from 15C to 27C o	Relative humidity conditions ranging from 5 to 95%, non-condensing; and o	Operating conditions at altitudes ranging between 0 and 3,300 feet without de-rating performance. The attached Statement of Work/Specifications further defines the requirements for project management, configuration management, quality control, technical support, installation services, test and evaluation, logistics support, and training requirements. Special warranty provisions applies.  The Government's desired warranty is 2-years parts and labor after final delivery, installation and acceptance.   This is a market survey to solicit statements of interest and capability to fulfill the Government's needs from all interested parties in regards to this requirement.  The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 335911; Storage Battery Manufacturing. In order to make this determination, the FAA requires the following information from vendors: 1.	Statement whether the Government's needs can be met (per attached draft SOW) 2.	Size and status of potential sources 3.	Customary practices, including warranties The response(s) to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  The survey is not to be construed as a screening information request (SIR), nor request for offer (RFO).  As such, the FAA will not accept unsolicited proposals and assumes no liability for any cost associated with the submission of responses to the market survey. This announcement and the draft SOW are located at: http://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm. Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide questions or comments in writing to Kenneth.M.Carter@faa.gov, or or via facsimile at: (202) 267-5420, by 1:00 p.m. EDST, 19 July 2007.  The Contracting Officer will not respond to telephonic inquiries. All responses to this market survey must be submitted electronically (via e-mail) to: Kenneth.M.Carter@faa.gov, or via facsimile at: (202) 267-5420, and must be received by 1:00 p.m. EDST, 8 August 2007.

<SUBJECT>Z--WPAFB CONSTRUCTION: Replace SCADA System Basewide (Project 050011)
<SOLNBR>FA8601-07-R-0046
<RESPDATE>073107
<ARCHDATE>10312007
<CONTACT>Kathy Bell, (937) 522-4519
<DESC>UPDATE (23 July 2007) Amendment 0004 has been posted. DESCRIPTION:  Solicitation Number FA8601-07-R-0046:The scope consists of  furnishing all labor, equipment, appliances, devices and materials, and  performing all operations necessary in connection with Project 050011,  Replace SCADA System Basewide. This project replaces the remote monitoring  and control system, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), for  the primary electrical power distribution system located at WPAFB. This  system consists of power sensors, relays, remote terminal units, and the  interconnecting control conductors in 9 substations located throughout the  base. It also consists of a front end computer system located in one  central facility along with other remote monitoring sites. This project  requires very specialized equipment and computer programming to result in  a fully functional SCADA system.  The SCADA system monitors the entire  primary electrical distribution system, and allows for complete control of  that system. The scope will also include associated architectural, civil,  structural, mechanical, plumbing, electrical and miscellaneous work as  shown on the project drawings and described in the specifications. NAICS  Code 238210 Size Standard $13.0 Million. The overall estimated price range  is between $1M and $5M. Period of Performance is 365 days. This is an  unrestricted acquisition in accordance with the Small Business  Competitiveness Demonstration Program Act of 1988, Public Law 100-656 (15  U.S.C. 644 note). In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, contractors must  be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award  of solicitations issued after 31 May 1998. Registration may be  accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov, or telephone at 1-888-CCR-2423. Every  solicitation issued after 31 May 1998 must include the clause at DFARS  252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration. SPECIAL  REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS:The SCADA system monitors and controls the primary  electrical distribution system for all of WPAFB. The contract requires the  installation of highly specialized hardware controlled by custom written  computer code. It requires the correct installation of thousands of  control conductors, hundreds of relays, and hundreds of sensors. Mistakes  can cause unscheduled power outages to multiple facilities throughout the  base, and can be difficult to trace to eliminate. Each unscheduled power  outage has a large financial impact to the base, and the primary  electrical distribution system is the most critical utility system of all.  Notes: (1)The solicitation will be available on the website on or about 22  June 2007, at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate a Firm Fixed prices type contract with Time and Material provisions for services (including labor) for the development of a threat evaluation software system to improve maritime domain awareness in a selected Area of Responsibility (AOR) as required by the Commander Navy Europe/Commander Sixth Fleet, Naples, Italy.  This is a 100% Small Business set aside under North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) 541511.

The means of achieving this goal under contract will be to apply a COMPUTER ASSISTED MARITIME THREAT EVALUATION SYSTEM software program, fully compatible and interfaced with maritime detection data inputted from deployed equipment, tools, instruments, or other data sources, and authorized to operate in a military or a coalition network environment (classified or non-classified). The contractor shall provide a computer based threat evaluation system together with any other complementary, associated, supporting or bundled programs that will analyze ocean going cargo vessels for security implications in support of comprehensive maritime domain awareness efforts. The system shall allow for utilization of business rules developed in collaboration with coalition/Alliance partners, be approved by the US Navy and access external data to allow accurate, in depth and reliable threat evaluation and analysis, realistic and practical recommendations for interdiction, boarding or other appropriate action. Features shall include: Automatic data stream to identify and geolocate vessels; allow specification of parameters controlling which vessels to evaluate i.e. (geographic bounds, flag state, vessel type or size etc.); allow for access to external data to discover vessel, crew, cargo and voyage data; allow user developed threat evaluation rules and scoring to be applied to data automatically; shall display an operational picture with indications of threat status for all vessels based on a logical combination of scores derived from the application of each threat evaluation rule; and allow drill-down to display logic behind the threat status for each vessel. EXAMINATION OF SOURCE SELECTION PLAN Offerors are invited to examine the Navy?s Source Selection Plan (SSP), located at <http://www.fedbizops.gov>.  It is not unusual for an SSP to contain some matters not specifically described in the solicitation, and vice versa.  For instance, the SSP will often identify the evaluation weighting scheme in greater detail, and may include the forms used by the Technical Evaluation Board in reviewing proposals. Despite these variations, both documents are intended to operate in harmony.  If any Offeror discovers an actual conflict between the provisions of the SSP and the Solicitation, this matter must be brought to the attention of the Contracting Officer before the proposal submission date.  Please keep in mind that a conflict involves provisions that are inconsistent or mutually exclusive, not merely containing more detailed or additional information.  In the event that the SSP and the solicitation are in direct conflict, the provisions of the solicitation will apply, except for those matters referenced in the SSP that may be mandated by law or regulation.  

N.B.: If the Offeror cannot access the SSP from the address provided above, immediately contact the Contracting Officer or the Governments designated representative identified in. The proposed request for proposals (RFP) N00189-07-R-0032 will be posted on or before 03 August 2007 with a response date of 30 days thereafter. Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  This office no longer issues hardcopy solicitations.  

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to other than price with the offerors at anytime prior to award.  By submitting a proposal, the offeror will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal Agency.   Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the proposal.  By submission of a proposal, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that the prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside of the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make the offeror ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://ccr.gov.

(5) Is the position of Financial and Administrative Support Technician a designation under the DOL?

(6) Is this position covered by the SCA? 
ANSWER:  Yes, the solicitation is amended accordingly?see below.

(7) What is the level of clearance required? Are any previously issued clearances required or preferred?

(8)  How many resumes of candidates should be submitted? 
ANSWER:  That is up to the offeror.  Currently, we plan to only fund one staff position.

(9)  If our company places administrative support personnel nationwide, including several in Washington D.C., operates out of Colorado without a satellite office in the D.C. area, will we be at a significant disadvantage without a local office? 
ANSWER:  This solicitation does not exclude any out-of- DC metro area firms, however, it could raise a question as to the strength of the firm?s  pre-screening process,  as well as how quickly an out-of-area firm could respond to any performance issues that come up.  

(10)  Do introductions, table of contents, or cover pages count toward the page limitations stated in the solicitation? 
ANSWER:  The introduction should be included in the Technical Capabilities Statement which is limited to 5 pages.  Cover sheets and table of contents are not included in this limitation.
(11)  On page 2 of the solicitation it mentions reporting and status meetings.  Who attends the meetings (is it the person working onsite, or is it a firm representative)?  Also, who is responsible for the reporting (the onsite person or firm representative)?
ANSWER:  The monthly status meetings are for the on-site staff and the COTR.  Monthly financial reporting is done by the firm. 

(12) Pricing for CLIN 0001 is based on 600 project labor hours. Is this estimated number of hours for both resources that should be proposed or just for a single resource? The second question is based on CLIN 0002 and CLIN 0003, which both project 1920 hours per CLIN. Is this total number of projected hours per resource or for both proposed resources. 
ANSWER:  The estimated hours were based upon one staff position.  However, see amended language below.
 
2.  The following clauses are incorporated by reference:

52.222-41, Service Contract Act of 1965 as amended; and 52.222-42  Statement of Equivalent Rates for Federal Hires (with the following insert:  Clerk IV, $18.74/hour).

3.  Wage Determination No. 1994-2103, Rev. 35 will be incorporated into the awarded contract.  

4.   The price evaluation is amended to read as follows: 
?The price evaluation shall include the base period and all options. Although the Government intends to fund one staff position at this time, the evaluation shall include hours for up to two staff.  The total of the base and option hours and resulting price will establish a maximum ceiling price for the contract.  CLIN 0001 shall be evaluated for 1200 hours (estimate for 40 hours per week x 15 weeks per staff person x 2 staff); CLIN 0002 and CLIN 0003 shall be evaluated at 3,840 hours each (estimate for 1920 hours per staff person for 1 year x 2 staff).?

5.  The time and date for receipt of proposals remains 12 noon, May 30, 2007.

<DESC>1.  Requirement #5, The vendor shall provide no-less than three bars: Network Engineering normally doesn't offer or guarantee services based on bars on the phone. I have heard some carriers' phones are setup to show bars even at the lowest available signal levels.  Also, phones may show different bars depending on their make s and models.  Signal level strengths are much more reliable (in Decibels based on milliamps or dBm).  Could the RFP be changed accordingly?   Ideal reception exceeding -86dbm without dropping calls. 2.  Requirement #6, Priority access: I know this topic has come up from time to time.  I am not sure if we can do this at the present time on Voice systems.  For EVDO, once we go Rev A we should be able to do so.  I am deferring this part to other team members (Mark or Zoran??) A challenge for all interested parties. Regarding requirement 6, the only priority access service planned is the government sponsored Wireless Priority Service (WPS) which has the following restrictions: 1) WPS Phase 1 (outgoing voice calls only) is not available today on our network but scheduled for launch this year (4Q - I'm looking for a more defined date). 2) WPS does require the user to dial special access codes, one for the radio network (Star code) and one for the LD network (800 number defined by the GETS program). 3) WPS Phase 1 will only be available at the sites served by the Shreveport, Monroe and Jackson (Houma) MSC's.  New Orleans and Baton Rouge are dependent on replacement of the Motorola MSC and the IOS WPS feature, slated for EOY08 or 1Q09. Another challenge for all interested parties. 3.  Requirement #9, Negotiating agreements with other MVNOs: Not always easy to do both Technically and Operationally.  Besides Qualcomm, which other MVNO is involved?  We need more information about this item. You have the unique opportunity to become the third party broker and the MVNO under this RFP. 4.  Requirement #10, Integrations of LAARNG's existing Qualcomm towers: As you know, Qualcomm does not own any Cellular spectrum and they usually come to us and other carriers to borrow spectrum when needed.  We need to know where these towers are and in which carrier's service area.  Again, to make this integration seamless i t is more challenging than it seems on the surface.  We need more detailed info on this topic too. The only Legacy System will be the Qualcomm mobile CDMA tower. 5.  Requirement #15, Capacity for 100-200 devices: Do you have any details on what type of and call patterns for these devices?  Are we talking about Voice and/or Data devices?  Yes we are. We can handle this request easier than some of the points above, RF just need more details on how to size the network /sites to provide sufficient capacity. 6.  Finally, Requirement #32, Integration of legacy technologies/systems: I am not sure what is meant here.  Again, we need more information and detail on these legacy systems and what is meant by integration.  As an example, if a Analog is one legacy system, FCC will hopefully sunset it next year.  Would this be OK to LAARNG?? National Guard		City		Coverage Today? Jackson Barracks		New Orleans	Yes - New Orleans MSA Gillis W. Long Center	Carville	Yes - LA 06 Camp Beauregard		Pineville	Yes - Alexandria MSA  Camp Minden			Doyline	Yes - Shreveport MSA Camp Villerie		Slidell	Yes - New Orleans MSA JOC-FWD			Baton Rouge	Yes - Baton Rouge MSA Technical and statewide limitations need to be addressed in your proposal.  Any of these limitations will not be challenged if the vendor addresses internal corporate priorities in the best interest of the customer and evident in the proposal.  We trust al l vendors are doing this. Interested vendors shall submit an original and 3 copies of their proposal to the contracting officer, COL Patti Woods, 495 3rd Street Camp Beauregard, Pineville, LA 71360.   Hard copies only. Proposals are due not later than 1 August  2007, 1100am.local time. Formal RFP document may be found at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/solicitation_search_form.cfm.

<ARCHDATE>07222008
<CONTACT>Carmen Bernhardt (LC-3118) Purchasing Agent 7022938309     cbernhardt@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, (Reclamation), Boulder City Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Ottawa Engineering, Ottawa, ON  K2B 7E1.  The Lower Colorado Regional Office of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and the Honolulu Board of Water Supply (BWS) are interested in the small hydropower potential on a proposed reclaimed water pipeline. The proposed pipeline is about 35,000 feet long from the Wahiawa Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) to the Central Oahu Regional Park (CORP).  The highest elevation near the upper end of the pipeline is about 860 feet and the lowest elevation near CORP is about 320 feet.  The initial flow from the WWTP will be about 2 million gallons per day (mgd).  The flow may increase if the Schofield WWTP is connected to the main reclaimed water pipeline.  Reclamation will provide flow data from the Wahiawa WWTP before a site visit. The goal of the preliminary assessment is to determine if small hydro development on the proposed pipeline is economically beneficial.  A report documenting the preliminary findings shall be completed by December, 2007, assuming the optional work listed below is not exercised. Task Items 1 - Site reconnaissance and meetings with Honolulu Board of Water Supply officials and engineers to understand proposed water system modifications and identify opportunities for small hydro.  2 - Explore/estimate the relationship between incremental increased pipeline cost and estimated small hydropower installation cost and revenue. 3 - Describe the method used to determine the optimal cost/revenue pipeline design. 4 - Describe the pipeline design and location of one or more small hydro plant yielding the optimal value. 5 - Show RETscreen cost analysis for 50 years for the above. 6 - Document results in a PowerPoint presentation to BWS and Reclamation in Honolulu.  Write a letter report if Reclamation, in consultation with BWS, decides not to continue with the optional work listed below. Optional Work  We would like to complete a refinement of concept if it is clear from performance of the above tasks that small hydro on the pipeline is economically beneficial.  The decision to complete the optional work will rest solely with Reclamation (in consultation with the Board of Water Supply) and may depend on other items such as available funding.  Results of the optional tasks will be reported in one report combined with the preliminary assessment work. Optional Task Items 1 - Solicit price quotes and layout drawings from suitable turbine manufacturers. 2 - Assess access requirements for the (or each) proposed small hydro plant site. 3 - Layout proposed powerhouse (conceptual drawings only).  4 - Layout proposed new power lines on a map. 5 - Discuss interconnection requirements. 6 - Recommend small hydro plant SCADA system design (integration with WWTP SCADA?) 7 - Re-run RETscreen. 8 - Document the refinement of concept tasks above in a report which includes the preliminary assessment. It is considered to be cost effective and in the best interest of the Government to award this to Ottawa Engineering Limited. This procurement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is August 20, 2007. Questions may be directed to Carmen Bernhardt (702) 293-8309 or e-mail to:  cbernhardt@lc.usbr.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541620 and the size standard is six million dollars.

Ste G, Ventura, CA 93003-8095 for 4-channel chillers with glass condensers and parts to dry the sample air streams for the measurements of atmospheric composition at the NOAA/GMD tall towers observatories.  Each channel must be able to cool 5 standard liters per minute (SLPM) of air to a dew point of less than 4 deg C. Also required are liquid alarm sensors and related electronics that are accessories for the chillers.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  No contract will be awarded as a result of the responses received.  The Marine Corps will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with information submitted in response to this RFI notice.

The purpose of this RFI notice is to determine industry interest and capabilities to provide food services at 53 mess halls located in the continental United States.  The NAICS Code for this requirement is 722310 with a size standard of $19 million.  Information is requested from industry to assist the USMC in assessing the market of food service providers and identifying contractors interested in submitting a proposal for the Marine Corps planned follow-on Regional Garrison Food Service Contracts (RGFSC).  The Government is not calling for offers at this time; this announcement is an expression of interest only.

The USMC current RGFSC provides food services at 32 mess halls in the eastern United States and 21 mess halls in the western United States.  The mess halls are located at USMC installations in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Arizona, California, and the District of Columbia.  Collectively, the mess halls serve approximately 24 to 27 million meals annually, are open 365 days per year, and provide a wide range of meals, including cafeteria-style meals, fast-food meals, special meals for holidays and celebrations, box lunches and flight-line meals.

The USMC anticipates establishing follow-on, performance-based, fixed-price services contracts to succeed the current RGFSC contracts.  The goals anticipated for the contracts include the following: (1) providing Marines with high quality, highly acceptable, nutritious meals prepared and served in a clean and pleasant environment; (2) providing meals at a fair and reasonable price; and (3) capitalizing on industry efficiencies, innovations, and economies of scale.  A draft RFP and pre-solicitation conference/industry day are tentatively scheduled for the spring of 2008.

Respondents are requested to provide responses to the questions listed below.  Please send your response to John Martin, via email at john.p.martin5@usmc.mil.

Provide recommendations for performance metrics, quality control, and food safety measures that can be incorporated into this effort.  11.

Please e-mail your response to this message to Dana Ivey at dana.ivey@va.gov, Ph. (202) 565-7063, or to diane.campbell@va.gov, Ph. (202) 565-4220, by no later than 2:00 p.m., EST, Friday, August 17, 2007.   Public Law 106-50, the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999 established a statutory Government-wide goal that 3 percent of all Federal procurement dollars be spent with SDVOSBs. In an effort to enhance opportunities for SDVOSBs and increase the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) accomplishments in this important socioeconomic category, VA's National Cemetery Administration is performing preliminary market research to gauge the level of interest and capabilities of SDVOSBs with regards to an upcoming acquisition for Construction Services at the Puerto Rico National Cemetery in Bayamon, Puerto Rico.  The findings of the preliminary market research will be used in considering a 100% set aside for SDVOSBs, pursuant to the set-aside authority contained in Public Law 108-183, the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003, as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 19.14. NAICS code for this acquisition is 237990.  The Size Standard is $31.0 Million.  The magnitude of this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  Project is subject to the availability of funds.  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:  The contractor shall provide labor, materials, equipment and supervision to develop approximately 1 acre of what is known as section &quot;O&quot; and to install approximately 2000 pre-placed plastic &quot;Vantage Products&quot; crypts at the Puerto Rico National Cemetery, Bayamon, Puerto Rico. Work includes but not limited to earthwork, soldier piling, concrete work, clearing, grubbing, plastic vantage crypts procurement/installation, drainage work, masonry, sodding, site security, land survey work for gravesite control markers and certain other construction items.  Period of performance is estimated to be approximately 12 months. Environmental permit is not required for this project since a new government environmental general permit was already obtained for a previous similar project. The permit was approved by the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board. This permit allows for future expansion projects for a period of five (5) years which expires June 21, 2012. This permit consolidates the three major environmental permits for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico: Plan CES, DS-3, and PFE permits.  All work shall be accomplished per drawings and specifications prepared by government-retained Architect/Engineer. REQUIRED RESPONSES:  Your review of this information and response to the following questions will be very helpful in determining if this acquisition may be set-aside exclusively for competition among SDVOSBs.  Please review the specifications and technical requirements carefully before responding to this e-mail.

Please include any information relevant to any potential difficulties you note with complying fully with the Statement of Work and specifications.

In the event the federal government fails to locate a sufficient number of SDVOSB and VOSBs under this new Public Law, the government is seeking all 8(a) contractors who are interested and qualified to provide this contracting service In an effort to enhance opportunities for 8(a) contractors and increase the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) accomplishments in this important socioeconomic category, VA's National Cemetery Administration is performing preliminary market research to gauge the level of interest and capabilities of 8(a) contractors with regards to an upcoming acquisition for Construction Services at the Puerto Rico National Cemetery in Bayamon, Puerto Rico.  The findings of the preliminary market research will be used in considering a 100% set aside for 8(a), pursuant to the set-aside authority contained in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 19.8. NAICS code for this acquisition is 237990.  The Size Standard is $31.0 Million.  The magnitude of this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  Project is subject to the availability of funds.  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:  The contractor shall provide labor, materials, equipment and supervision to develop approximately 1 acre of what is known as section &quot;O&quot; and to install approximately 2000 pre-placed plastic &quot;Vantage Products&quot; crypts at the Puerto Rico National Cemetery, Bayamon, Puerto Rico. Work includes but not limited to earthwork, soldier piling, concrete work, clearing, grubbing, plastic vantage crypts procurement/installation, drainage work, masonry, sodding, site security, land survey work for gravesite control markers and certain other construction items.  Period of performance is estimated to be approximately 12 months. Environmental permit is not required for this project since a new government environmental general permit was already obtained for a previous similar project. The permit was approved by the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board. This permit allows for future expansion projects for a period of five (5) years which expires June 21, 2012. This permit consolidates the three major environmental permits for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico: Plan CES, DS-3, and PFE permits.  All work shall be accomplished per drawings and specifications prepared by government-retained Architect/Engineer.

However any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give a written for fax notification to the Contracting Officer within five (5) calender days from the date of this published synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer, FMC Butner, Attn: Teresa Cooper, P O Box 999, Butner, NC 27509. Information can be faxed to 919-575-4821. Responses received will be evaluated, however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>70 -- RFI  Server Questions and Answers
<DESC>Q.  Is this an All or Nothing Bid? 
A.  Not for bid.  This is a request for information from vendors on their current server technologies.  

Q.  What specifically will these servers be used for?
A.  Various. 

Q.  Could you describe in some detail what the "Two Node Distributed Data Center" consists of and requirements for so I can address how our products may meet these requirements?
A.  The Two Node Distributed Data Center would conceptually consist of two identical yet geographically separate server farms that are capable of independently servicing all the automation requirements of USSOCOM.  Server farms would replicate certain data types to ensure data redundancy and availability.   

Q. Please clarify what you are looking for when you are requesting information on:

1. Prior testing
2. Test report 
3. Estimated schedule

A1. Prior testing = summary of any testing related to performance, durability, maintenance, or government certification and accreditation.    

A2. Test report = Disregard, summary of any prior testing will suffice.

A3. Estimated schedule = The statement ?estimated schedule and an estimated cost for the price of test articles and production units? is misleading.  

Statement is amended to read:
estimated cost and anticipated delivery time required for test articles and production units. 

Q.  What applications will be run on the servers, and what Operating System is envisioned.  Perhaps the applications will point to the OS.
A.  Our current scope is focused solely on review of hardware technical specifications and performance parameters independent of operating system.

Q. Is there a specific document format that you require?
A. No.  Whitepapers and specification documentation in a format chosen by the vendor will suffice.

Q.  What will be the result of the market survey?
A.  Market survey results will be used to identify server technologies for in depth testing in our LAB.

Q.  Is this requirement, Memory intensive, Input/Output intensive, or transaction intensive?
A.  Memory performance, I/O, and transaction performance should all be addressed in the provided documentation.

Q.  Can the response date of this RFI be extended to 20 July?
A.  Extended to 31 July.

<SUBJECT>--Air Driven Gas Booster Pumps
<DESC>The Directorate of Contracting (DOC), Fort Campbell, KY, has a requirement for Air Driven Gas Booster Pumps.  The procurement will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented b y FAR 6.302-1 and awarded on an unrestricted basis.  The Agency intends to enter into a firm-fixed-price, supply-type contract with Haskel International, Inc. located in Burbank CA.  The basis for restricting competition is the regulatory restrictions for safety reasons within the Department of Defense.  This is the only manufacturer that is approved by the U.S. Navy to provide this pump for scuba operations support.  Required quantity is 4 each of the Air Driven Gas Booster Pumps with the following specifi cations: Gas Booster:  Model 27187 (28881-AGT-15/30 modified for oxygen service).  Air driven, two stage, reciprocating air motor, balanced opposed piston type.  The high pressure oxygen barrels are triple sealed, non-lubricated, hydrocarbon free, and separated fro m the air drive.  Air drive section:  NO OILING required, factory lubricated, corrosion resistant.  Cooling with air exhaust to both stages and intercooler. This model booster (AGT-15/30) is capable of gas outlet pressures equal to 30 X the Air Drive Pressure, plus 2 X the Gas Inlet Pressure. 	E.g.:  With 75 psi air drive (5 bar) and 500 psi gas inlet (34 bar), the booster will only produce or  stall at 3,250 psi (224 bar).   30 X 75 psi    +    2 X 500 psi = 3,250 psi outlet. Minimum Air Drive Quantity: 70 SCFM for full cycling speed.  Lower volumes will cause the booster to cycle slower and result in slower fill times. Air drive pressure range: 40 - 150 psi (3 - 10 bar). Maximum gas inlet: 2500 psi (172 bar) (First Stage X Max. Air Drive, 15 X 150=2500). Maximum gas outlet: 5000 psi (345 bar).  Equipment will be delivered to Fort Campbell, KY.  NAICS code for this procurement is 333996 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  This sole source requirement will be procured under Commercial Items and Other Than Full and Open Competiti on, and awarded on an unrestricted basis.

BACKGROUND Reclamation's Denver IT Managers are undertaking implementation of ITIL processes and need to understand the current level of process maturity.  Having this information will ensure the organization moves forward with the alignment of IT processes in a logical and consistent manner. WORK TO BE PERFORMED BY CONTRACTOR Assessment: Reclamation's IT Services Division is in need of a review of the effectiveness and efficiency of the division's IT practices. We require a structured approach to assess operational and strategic personnel and technical practices, and be provided a process model of our IT service management group. Successful consultant input will provide recommendations on how to make IT cost savings, provide more effective service support and delivery and demonstrate measurable improvements in services the organization provides to its customers.  All work performed should result in the deliverables outlined below in "Summary of Deliverables," independent of a software solution (no specific vendor solution is required at this point). SUMMARY OF DELIVERABLES Measurements of the maturity The consultant will provide measurements of the maturity in six areas of Reclamation's IT Service Management processes, along with recommendations on how to improve service support, delivery and efficiency, as well as reduce costs. The six processes to assess: Incident Management Problem Management Configuration Management Change Management Service Level Management Release Management Each of the processes will be defined as being in one of the following five stages of maturity: Initiation Awareness Control Integration Optimization The review of the process maturity of our IT Service Management is to be measured against best practices and industry standards as defined by ITIL best practices. Priority areas will be highlighted, giving Reclamation the opportunity to directly focus IT Service Management efforts where they will best benefit the organization. The final deliverable will include: A detailed report on the findings. Recommendations to improve and further align the organization to ITIL best practices. Written suggestions to improve the IT Services Division in each of the 6 process areas mentioned above. A roadmap or implementation plan that describes the procedures to implement the improvement suggestions mentioned above in a phased approach. Reclamation requires that this service be independent of all hardware and software suppliers. PROJECT COMPLETION/DELIVERY SCHEDULE Acceptance of Deliverables  Final acceptance of all deliverables will occur in writing within thirty days of project completion.

<DESC>Background
A little more than 25 years have passed since the first U.S. diagnosed case of AIDS.  Although many efforts have been made to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS in the U.S., Americans continue to be affected by increasing HIV/AIDS prevalence rates.   HIV/AIDS is a health problem too complex for a single organization to address. Efforts must be increased to collaborate with leaders and organizations in the fight against HIV/AIDS.

Partnerships are a critical component of CDC?s efforts in the Advancing HIV Prevention (AHP) initiative.  Achieving CDC?s HIV prevention goals, and the objectives of AHP, requires effective collaboration and coordination with new and traditional partners.  

The National HIV/AIDS Partnership (NHAP) seeks to prevent the spread of HIV through the collective resources and talents of dynamic partnerships between public and private sectors. Additionally, NHAP seeks to mobilize public-private sectors to include the faith community and its leadership, to increase support for HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention in the United States through various recognition activities and events such as the Red Ribbon Leadership Awards. 

The objectives of NHAP are to:
disseminate NHAP prevention messages regarding benefits of early HIV testing, prevention, and care;
address the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS by promoting open dialogue about the disease, and support for those persons living with HIV and AIDS; and	increase the ability of partners to promote HIV prevention awareness within their organizations and communities.

<DESC>Background
A little more than 25 years have passed since the first U.S. diagnosed case of AIDS.  Although many efforts have been made to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS in the U.S., Americans continue to be affected by increasing HIV/AIDS prevalence rates.   HIV/AIDS is a health problem too complex for a single organization to address. Efforts must be increased to collaborate with leaders and organizations in the fight against HIV/AIDS.

Partnerships are a critical component of CDC?s efforts in the Advancing HIV Prevention (AHP) initiative.  Achieving CDC?s HIV prevention goals, and the objectives of AHP, requires effective collaboration and coordination with new and traditional partners.  

The National HIV/AIDS Partnership (NHAP) seeks to prevent the spread of HIV through the collective resources and talents of dynamic partnerships between public and private sectors. Additionally, NHAP seeks to mobilize public-private sectors to include the faith community and its leadership, to increase support for HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention in the United States through various recognition activities and events such as the Red Ribbon Leadership Awards. 

The objectives of NHAP are to:
?	disseminate NHAP prevention messages regarding benefits of early HIV testing, prevention, and care;
?	address the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS by promoting open dialogue about the disease, and support for those persons living with HIV and AIDS; and
?	increase the ability of partners to promote HIV prevention awareness within their organizations and communities.

This combined synopsis constitutes a solicitation and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-12.

Each door is 20 feet across with a total of five doors per set making it cover the whole 200 plus feet of track.  When the doors are fully opened there is 20 feet on each side that is obstructed by the opened doors.  That gives 180 feet of open area on each side.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(End of provision)
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>OPM has delegated the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) authority to conduct personnel security background investigations on ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as periodic reinvestigations on all current employees.   The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information.  Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, the Privacy Act of 1974, Office of Personnel Management regulations, other relevant regulations from the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures.  ATF will provide these regulations to the Contractor.

ATF has established a contract background investigation program to contract these investigations out to trained and experienced investigators.  Operational and administration aspects of the program are also contracted out to trained and experienced investigators or personnel security professionals, typically, though not exclusively, retired federal investigators who have at least 3 years of current experience in the administration of and/or conduct of personnel security background investigations.  Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by ATF.

Contractors must be computer literate and efficient in software programs that support email, word processing, and data entry, which are utilized in the administration of the personnel security program.

Contractors' duties and work hours are dictated by the ATF workload and funding availability.  Contractors are expected to be available to accept work as requested.  Contractors will be paid at the rate of $53.00 per hour.  Internal reviews of Contractor performance are conducted on a quarterly basis.  

In compliance with ATF's specific invoicing procedures, Contractors must submit an invoice for payment detailing the number of hours worked.  Such invoice will be subject to audit by ATF. Contractors must also execute a Contractor Certification that declares that any submission of a Contractor's invoice represents actual hours performed in accordance with requirements of the Statement of Work. 

ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services.  This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations.  Consequently contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract.  Contractors are further advised that the third party is required to make payments in the same timely manner as ATF.  

Contractors must be willing to attend periodic conferences at selected locations within the United States.  Conferences are usually limited to one per year.  

Contractors will have access to ATF's computer network and will sign ATF P 7500.1, ATF Rules of Behavior and Customer Agreement for ATF Workstation Users.  Contractors are required to successfully complete ATF Information System Security Awareness training each year.

Contractors shall submit to the performance of a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).  Favorable adjudication of the SSBI must be determined by ATF prior to access to ATF facilities and information.  ATF will conduct an SSBI-Periodic Reinvestigation on contract investigators every five years.

Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  

Contractors must obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and have a current registration in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) for payment via electronic funds transfer. 

ATF intends to issue vendors Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) that will be available for placing calls/orders through September 30, 2010.  The solicitation will close August 15, 2007.  All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) contractors.  A BPA will be awarded after all evaluations are passed, tentative selections are made, interviews completed and background investigations adjudicated favorably.  Because ATF's needs are dynamic, ATF anticipates a requirement to periodically re-open this solicitation add new contractors to the pool.  

Vendors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA.  A BPA is not a contract.  A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish and eliminates the need for more complex acquisition methods.  There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity.  All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected vendor, or the call will be transferred to another vendor.  Calls/orders may be competed among all vendors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF representative.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 Investigation Services, and is the appropriate designation required by the CCR.

The following clauses are incorporated in full force:  FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror and Commercial Items (Oct. 00)  and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial (incorporated by reference)  Each Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items;  A copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications- can be found on the web at www.arnet.gov/far. The Contractor may request a copy from siadministration@atf.gov.  Offeror shall provide a statement proving they have read and understand the term and Conditions set forth in the FAR 52.212-4.

EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.

Capability of the Vendor.

ATF will consider BPAs to vendors, as needed, on a pass/fail basis, based on past performance and experience, and the vendor's acceptability (the acceptance of ATF terms and conditions including the hourly rate).  All vendors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor Registration.  These are mandatory requirements and any firm will be eliminated that fails to comply.  Vendors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability.  Vendors rated as "passed" will be awarded points for past performance and experience.  Vendors with an overall score of at least 77 points and that meet the mandatory requirements will be considered for issuance of a BPA and award will be made to those companies receiving the highest scores.  At least 65 points must come from Offeror Demonstrated Experience/Capabilities and 12 must come Vendor Qualifications.

a.  Experience/Capabilities (80 Points):  Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing.  A minimum of three years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended.  ATF will evaluate each vendor's experience on the basis of its breadth, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting and/or administering personnel security background investigations in the federal environment, as well as computer proficiency.  ATF may assess the vendor's communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. (65 points minimum).

b.  Qualifications/Past Performance (20 Points):  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a vendor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  ATF may contact some of the vendor's customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the vendor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the vendor's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the vendor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the vendor was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases.

For some guidance, the chamber being replaced measures 84 inches tall x 54 inches deep by 41 inches wide.

Item (a)2. One sensor located in the primary chamber (what we are purchasing) and the second sensor located in the secondary chamber (existing) where the conditioned air is being sent (and returned).


Item (G) Good question - given the challenges with a secondary chamber the tolerance on the control would be expected in the primary chamber only.

Additionally, can the Government provide instruction on what specific information is required in the 25 page limit for Task Order One?   For instance, are separate resumes required  in both the Master Contract proposal and the Task Order One proposal, even if those resumes are duplicative?
--Answer--Please provide 2 separate price proposals (one for the Master Contract and one for Task Order One) and 2 separate technical proposals (one for the Master Contract and one for Task Order One).

AIR FORCE RESEARCH LABORATORY MUNITIONS DIRECTORATE 
BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA)
MNK-BAA-07-0005
For
CONCEPT WEAPON SIMULATION SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (CWSSD)

A--INTRODUCTION:

The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Lethality and Vulnerability Branch (AFRL/MNAL) is interested in receiving proposals for the Concept Weapon Simulation Software Development (CWSSD) Program under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) MNK-BAA-07-0005, with the intent of negotiating one or more contracts for the CWSSD Program. 
 
B--REQUIREMENTS:  

(1)  Program Goal & Objective:  The goal of this work is to develop/prototype software that will be used to facilitate advancement of weapon concepts/employment.  The objective is to design, develop, combine and/or demonstrate engineering, engagement (one-on-one), mission (few-on-few), systems-of-systems, and campaign (many-on-many, military worth) level techniques, tools, and research methods which will enable quick and effective evaluation of advanced weapon concepts.   

(2) Technical Requirements:  Research involves, but is not limited to, intercommunicative weapons, novel destruct mechanisms, non-lethal destruct mechanisms, multiple targeting, and time critical delivery.  Accomplishing the program goals/objectives may involve a variety of weapon-related aspects, e.g., sensors, aerodynamics, autopilots, navigation and guidance schemes, propulsion, warheads, fuzes, datalinks, error filters, environment (wind, fog, dust), lethality, vulnerability, and threats.  Scenario development and visualization at various levels of weapon interaction are also expected.  Interface and utilization of existing tools includes, but is not limited to, ESAMS, RADGUNS, MATLAB Simulink, FLAMES, EADSIM, CFAM, and STORM.   The contractor must demonstrate an overall understanding of the concept weapon system software development process, familiarity with software simulation codes listed above and the technical capability to perform the requirements described herein.

(3) Program Tasking: 

(a) Task Order 0001:  Task Order 0001 will be to develop software design methods that will define a comprehensive target set along with the specific characteristics associated with a generic target set consisting of terrorists, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and chemical and biological weapons.  The offeror shall research all aspects of the generic target set and develop a breakdown of the different classes and their particular identifying characteristics for use in design and software development of concept weapon characteristics used to engage these targets.  As an example, IED may currently be used to define a hidden artillery shell rigged with a detonator.  However another form may be a vehicle filled with fertilizer-based explosives rigged to explode and do similar damage.  The comprehensive target set should include as many varieties as possible of the generic targets that might exist and their specific characteristics. 

(b) Subsequent Task Orders:  May be issued based on contractor?s strengths demonstrated during performance of Task Order 0001.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT.  
PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

PROJECT SGBP 07-4003

PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE (PCC) PAVEMENT CRUSHING


1.  Scope:  The U.S. Government is requesting proposals for crushing of broken concrete mixed with metal reinforcing.  The concrete stockpile is approximately 2,000 tons in terms of weight, 43,000 square feet in terms of mass, and 10 inches thick.  The stockpile is located at Offutt AFB, NE.  Contractors will be required to provide a portable crushing plant onsite, recycle all metals removed from concrete, and leave site in a clean and orderly manner.  This project is to crush concrete to use the product as base course and there is no need for any outside testing.  Water is available from a hydrant near the site, but contractor must transport water to the plant site via contractor temporary piping or hose.  The contractor will be responsible for providing a suitable backflow prevention device. 

2.  Major Items of Work:  The services to be covered by the contract include:

a.	Contractor shall provide a portable concrete crushing plant adequate in size to complete the described project but small enough to work within the site space constraints. A map outlining the stockpile and processing area is attached for reference. 

b.	Contractor shall crush all stockpiled concrete to the specified gradation (see Table 1) and store finished product within the storage area, which is approximately 100 feet away from the work site itself. 

c.	Contractor shall comply with all Federal and Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality permit conditions, rules and regulations, as well as those of other regulatory agencies. All permits will be provided by Offutt AFB?s environmental office with Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality permit/registration for crushing grinding equipment and power plant. 

d.	Contractor must maintain compliance with the Offutt Air Force Base air permit issued by the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality.  No particulate matter (i.e., dust) shall become airborne and remain visible past the Offutt AFB property line due to the contractor?s operation (rock crushing, material movement, etc.). Pavement equipment shop (CEO1) will provide a storm water pollution prevention plan.  CEO 1 is responsible to install silk fence around all storm inlets so no contaminants leave the site.

e.	Contractor shall provide a safety plan specific to this project and maintain an onsite safety coordinator during all operations.  

f.	Contractor shall properly dispose of all trash and non-recyclable items from the job site daily. 

g.	Contractor shall recycle all recovered metals at an on-site location designated by the government. 

h.	Contractor shall remove all equipment, metals, and trash from the site at completion of the project. Site should be left in clean and orderly manner. 

i.	Contractor shall ensure all product stockpiles left on-site, must be left free of scraps or other formations that may slide or fail, and maintained to allow traffic access around the site. 

j.	Contractor?s proposal shall include all required labor, equipment, permits, fees, and materials required to complete the work.

3.  Project Schedule:  Crushing operations may only occur between the hours of 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, and shall be coordinated through the civil engineering Government representative listed in the contract.  Project commencement is to be coordinated with the Government representative and project completion shall occur by 1-Nov-07.

There is no change to the response date. 

REQ1033014     Leafy Greens Aerial Photography

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 541922, identified as REQ1033014, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. Hard copies will only be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.

BACKGROUND

In numerous produce/leafy green outbreaks, four consistent risk factors have been identified.  These include:

?	Fecally contaminated water used for irrigation (wells, reservoirs, surface water), through mixing with water used to dilute pesticides, or through unintentional contact via flooding
?	Inappropriately composted manure used as fertilizer on growing fields
?	Direct fecal contamination of product in fields from domestic or wild animals or from runoff from domestic or wild animals proximate to growing fields
?	Fecal contamination from workers harvesting product  

However, regulators and industry members have not had objective data to begin to assess the prevalence and relative magnitude of the risks identified above.  A review of existing data along with two proposed projects could provide regulators and industry members with some objective estimates of the prevalence and relative magnitude of two of the above risk factors. 


STATEMENT OF WORK

The contractor shall work closely with the project officer throughout this project.

The contractor shall:

1.  Survey Animal Population:
?	To estimate the prevalence of contamination occurring through proximity to domestic or wild animals such as dairy cattle, beef cattle, or feral pigs, we are proposing an aerial survey of x square miles (to be determined) in two different geographic areas of California that grow leafy greens. 
?	Past experience has shown that satellite imagery is not of sufficient resolution, too expensive, not current, and not always available in various combinations. Given the short time line here we do not feel that we can overcome these satellite problems in time for this seasons? effort. 
?	These intensive assessments would review the likelihood of contamination of the leafy green fields by direct contact with livestock or wild animals and from runoff from fecally contaminated water from domestic or wild animals.


2.  Survey Water:
?	A second proposed project would be a systematic scientific evaluation of x agricultural wells (could also do reservoirs/holding ponds or do reservoirs/holding ponds instead of ag wells ? reservoirs and holding ponds could also be identified from the aerial surveys above) in two leafy green growing regions in California.  
?	Two to ten square mile (to be determined) areas would be identified and randomly selected blocks of land would be identified from these areas.  
?	Protocols would provide investigators with information on where to begin the visual search for ag wells/reservoirs/holding ponds in this selected block.  
?	Investigators would complete sanitary surveys of ag wells and collect water samples from the first ag well/holding pond/reservoir identified in this randomly selected block.  
?	Additional water samples from the selected ag wells/reservoir/holding ponds would be collected (monthly, every other month, quarterly). 


SERVICES REQUIRED

1)	Provide aerial photography/survey (fixed wing or rotor) of locations (leafy green producing fields and surrounding environment) as designated by FDA/CFSAN (or designee).  Number and duration of flights to be determined.  Specific locations (2-4 areas of a few square miles) will be determined prior to each flight, but will be within the central California area, as defined as all areas between a line North of Los Angeles east to the Nevada/Arizona border, and a line south of San Francisco east to the Nevada border (most likely Salinas Valley, San Bonito Valley and/or Central Valley agricultural areas.)
2)	Schedule (actual flight times and duration) of aerial photography survey will be determined as the project progresses, and by arrangement with the vendor, to be occasionally made within 24 hours of notification, but normally within 5 working days. 
3)	Allow an FDA employee to ?fly-along? as passenger to direct the location of the photo survey or outbreak, and to point out any areas of special interest that may need further photographing.
4)	Provide digital images (number determined during flight) of the location as designated by FDA.  All images provided to FDA will be as digital files sized at a minimum of 8? x 12? at 300 dpi minimum  All images will be made using a stabilized (gyro or stabilized lens) digital camera, with very high resolution imagery (minimum of 10 megapixels.)
5)	All digital images will be delivered to FDA by electronic delivery, as agreed to by FDA.  Acceptable delivery methods may include CDRom, DVD, Web access or FTP access, or other means as agreed.  Raw images will be delivered within 24 hours of flight.  Processed images will be delivered within a mutual accepted timeframe, but no later than 5 working days of flight.
6)	Aerial photography may include vertical (straight down) imagery that can be orthorectified for measurement purposes.
7)	Aerial photography will include low altitude, oblique (angled) views for close-up imagery of subjects
8)	All images will be required to include GPS coordinates (Geo location synchronization) to be contained (imbedded as stored data) as EXIF information in each image file, as well as date and time stamp of the photo.
9)	As designated by the FDA, selected images will be processed to be overlayed using Google Earth.  Vendor will deliver to FDA appropriate Google Earth ?KMZ? data file with processed images.
10)	All images (both raw and processed) obtained during the flight become the property of the US Government, and the Food and Drug Administration. Vendor agrees not to copyright or make available to any source without written authorization from the FDA

<DESC>1.  Do you want Electric Drive or Hydrostatic drive?  Electric 2.  Do you want Data Acquisition and Control?  YES 3.  Do you want to be able to record/store/print data? YES 4.  Is the 250 HP a continuous rate or only a peak rate for specific tests? Continuous 5.  Is there a noise level you want to stay below?  No 6.  Is it the MT 645 or MT 654 transmission? MT654 7. Is there a bedplate in the test cell where the dynamometer is going to be installed?  There is no bed in the test cell, just bear concrete floor. 8. Are you implying with out stating that you need inline torque cells or if we can calculate are active current and calculate or torque is that acceptable? We need in-line torque cells 9. Are you wanting to run test profiles or just manual set points? We want to run test profiles 10.  Are we providing temperature and pressure sensors or just electrical inputs to display them in our operator interface? Just electrical inputs to display them in their operator interface 11. Is there a list of preferred or qualified local contractors for the base to assist with the installation as we are out of Indiana? No list of vendors that I am aware of. 12.   What are the protocols for the transmission communications or is it a simple analog / digital input/output? The 4L80E utilizes a Transmission Control Module (TCM), which is basically a computer that tells it when to shift. It reads the position of th e Throttle Position Sensor and tells the solenoids when to actuate. This controls the flow of fluid thru the valve body and changing the gear selection. 13.  What tests are to be performed on the Valve Body solenoids? The valve body tester is utilized to test the valve bodies of the 3L80E and 4L80E transmission to verify proper repair of the valve body before installation on the transmission. The test chec ks the signal of the solenoids by sending and receiving electrical pulses. This needs to be a digital signal to the computer. 14.  I'm not sure anyone could meet the deadline for delivery unless they had a system sitting on the shelf.  Is there a possibility of extending the delivery time? The system is needed by September.
