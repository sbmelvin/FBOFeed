<DESC>This for information purpose only. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a purchase order to MiraiBio, a division of Hitachi Software Engineering America LTD, 601 Gateway Blvd, Ste 100, South San Francisco, CA 94080. The authority for this sole source procurement is FAR 13.106-1 and FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. We have purchased the software separately.  The software is currently being used on an older Luminex instrument.  We need to purchase another instrument and only the Miraibio system of instrumentation and software will meet our needs.  This request is for the instrument only.

The Luminex system from MiraiBio will allow the Newborn Screening Quality Assurance Program to test for multiple analytes, from small molecules to proteins, to nucleic acids.  Other systems are restricted to certain classes of materials.  We have purchased the MiraiBio software separately.  The MiraiBio software is very flexibile and adaptable to fit numerous applications that other manufacturers do not offer.  MiraiBio will aid with set-up and specific applications.  

The MasterPlex Software Suite has unique features and characteristics (outlined below) for use with the Luminex xMAP technology for the following applications: protein quantification (absolute and relative), gene expression and microRNA analysis, regression analysis, as well as SNP genotyping, HLA typing and DNA detection assays.
(1) Remote client monitors increase efficiency and access to the instrument through remote monitoring from other laboratory workstations on the LAN. End-users can monitor time consuming acquisitions from other workstations instead of waiting in the lab in front of the instrument
(2) Nucleic acid assay data analysis: The MasterPlex Suite is the only commercially available package software that can perform data analysis for microRNA, mRNA and DNA assays.
(3) Network License - allows an organization to share purchased concurrent users on an unlimited amount of workstations within the same LAN.
(4) Custom report generator  Using transformation style sheets the custom report generator can be used to create virtually any report format desired. This feature also allows for the creation of data files that can be easily exported into downstream databases or a LIMS.
(5) Kit Template Manager- Import assay kit manufacturers templates or create custom template files that include both acquisition and analysis template information. This streamlines the workflow and allows end users to run an assay and get results with a few clicks of the mouse.
(6) Virtual Plate- Combine data from multiple plate runs. Perform cross-plate comparisons or expand the data analysis paradigm beyond the current 100 analyte per sample limit of the xMAP technology. The Virtual Plate feature allows a researcher to combine the disparate data sets for a single patient sample.
(7) Wizard Interface- Detailed wizards guide novice users through all aspects of operating the instrumentation and acquiring data.
(8) Graphing/Charting- A robust built-in graphing engine offers wide flexibility to generate high quality charts and graphs of the data analysis results.
The instrument available from other vendors is not pre-loaded with the MasterPlex software. It is only available from HISAL. Because HISAL specializes in software, not in making assay kits to run on the instrument, we are independently
flexible to continually update and upgrade the software in response to current needs of the research community so that Luminex users can apply the Multiplex technology to an ever- expanding menu of options and gain more utility from the instrument.
Firms that believe they can provide these services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 10 days of the publication date of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining to conduct a competitive procurement.

This is a unique application found only in the Division of Laboratory Sciences. The laboratory has a customized robotics system from Titertek Instruments. The robot uses the same dispensing instuments. Some of the extra parts ordered are interchangeable between the stand-alone instruments and the instruments on the robot.

The above equipment is essential to NIAMS continued research efforts under protocol # A007-03-01,  Entitled:  Studies on the Inflammatory and Allergic Responses of Mice Genetically Altered in the Expression of Molecules that Transmit Receptor-Induced Cellular Responses. They are conducting studies in mouse models to understand the impact of certain genes on asthma and lung function.  This research explores what is known as the allergic march, which is the observation that early childhood incidence of atopic dermatitis predisposes one to adult onset of asthma. In testing this hypothesis it is essential to obtain actual data that only this equipment has proven based on market research from these studies.  In addition, based on the discovery of a role for sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in allergic disease and reports of increased S1P in the lung of challenged asthmatics, we wish to explore whether increased levels of S1P in the lung predisposes or increases the severity of asthma. This current protocol and various other scientific research projects are under the supervision of under the supervision of Dr. Juan Rivera.

The following is the module and the components: 

 1) FV-CSS1-02   flexiVent complete system solution, one module;
