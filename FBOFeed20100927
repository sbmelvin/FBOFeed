If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<CONTACT>BAA10-51 Coordinator, Email BAA10-51@DARPA.MIL
<DESC>Summary of the Broad Agency Announcement (see PDF File for complete instructions):<br /><br />DARPA is soliciting innovative system-oriented research proposals in the area of large, low cost, lightweight, deployable, visible and/or infrared electro-optical systems for persistent, tactical, real-time video over denied territory for missile launch detection and tracking from geosynchronous orbit.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in such systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.
<p>The MOIRE program will provide persistent, real-time, tactical video and missile launch detection and tracking to the war fighter.  Development of diffractive membrane optics may facilitate low-cost geosynchronous imaging.  All designs must be traceable to an operational 20 m system providing 24/7 visible NIIRS 3.5+ coverage over denied areas with at least a 1 Hz update rate, FOV &gt; 100 km2, field of regard &gt; 108 km2 with a designed cost not to exceed $500M a copy after initial NRE.  This set of criteria is hereafter referred to as the objective Design Reference Mission (DRM).</p>
<p>DARPA seeks complete balanced innovative system-oriented proposals for MOIRE which address all the following important technical factors:</p>
<p>[1] Large low cost, lightweight, deployable, diffractive membrane optics for geosynchronous orbit imaging systems.</p>
<p>[2] Near real time image stabilization and tactical geolocation knowledge, exploiting exquisitely accurate attitude determination and control systems and ground truth controls</p>
<p>[3] A telescope design that increases spectral bandwidth</p>
<p>[4] Stability and dynamics of the large MOIRE structure in geosynchronous orbit</p>
<p>[5] Target motion detection capability at &gt; 0.1 Hz</p>
<p>[6] Probability of detection for a SCUD-class launch of 0.99, with less than one false alarm per month.</p>

<DESC>All inquiries concerning this announcement must be directed to Glenn Wilson, Contracting Officer, via email at glenn.a.wilson@faa.gov or at (202) 385-7730.
This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) regarding the Meteorological and Aeronautical Planning System (MAPS) program.  The responses to this market survey will be used for information purposes only.  
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR OFFER. THIS IS NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR).  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
INTRODUCTIONThis RFI is an announcement regarding the Meteorological and Aeronautical Planning System (MAPS) Program. The purpose of this RFI is to post a summary table of the MAPS' Preliminary Shortfall Analysis Report and elicit specific information regarding potential solutions that will address the required MAPS enhancements.Flight Services are currently provided by four separate contract vehicles. Preflight assistance and Inflight Advisory services in Alaska are provided by government employees using a leased automation system called the Operational and Supportability Implementation System (OASIS).  Preflight and Inflight support for the Continental United States (CONUS), Hawaii and Puerto Rico are currently provided by contract labor using a vendor-owned automation system called Flight Services through the 21st Century (FS21).  Additionally, there are two internet pilot web portals which enable pilots to self-brief and file/amend flight plans.  These systems are known as Direct User Access Terminal Services (DUAT/S. The term DUAT-Replacement (DUAT-R) is used to refer to the current contracts. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined that the best interest of the government and the aviation community would be served by integrating Alaska and CONUS requirements into a single platform to be deployed NAS-wide and the acquisition of this new platform will be best served by conducting a full and open competition.  
This RFI addresses the Flight Service automation requirements, along with the internet capabilities. The first contract delivery release would be deployed in the 2014-2015 timeframe.   
The FAA is especially interested in increased communications capabilities, internet and SWIM compliant systems with shared database technology based on industry experience with previously developed air traffic and flight service automation and voice systems. The FAA seeks to understand current and proposed industry capabilities to meet the requirements, the ability to meet the proposed deployment schedule including the acquisition strategy, and any suggestions that would further enhance safety and service delivery. The FAA also solicits recommendations or opinions as to the CONUS operational labor component and how best to structure the contract or contracts to meet the need for contract operational support in the CONUS. 
At this time, the FAA is not prepared to address service delivery locations.  This information will be provided in later Market Surveys or Screening Information Requests (SIRs).
Based upon the findings of this RFI, the FAA plans to release either a draft SIR for Industry comment or a formal SIR for Industry response or conduct an Industry Day. 
Proposed MAPS ENHANCEMENTS The impact of the service enhancements envisioned for MAPS will be a decrease in the number of general aviation (GA) aircraft accidents.  There is a direct correlation between a general aviation pilot not receiving a preflight weather briefing and/or en route updates and the occurrence of a weather-related aircraft accident.  In addition, this system will enhance post accident survivability by reducing search area and promoting a faster response by emergency services personnel. Currently both initial contact and subsequent contact depend on the pilot initiating the call to the FSS.  If the pilot does not call, important information pertinent to flight safety may not reach them.  This antiquated, customer contact-dependent "pull" model continues today.  As a result, pilots often do not receive safety-related information because they either do not or can not call Flight Service, or they call too late for the information to be of benefit. The MAPS solution is to augment the "pull" model by adding a "push" component, i.e., automatic update capability, to the system.  While pilots would continue to initiate services, automation would "push" critical updates to the pilot in time for them to make rational, safety-related decisions about their flight.  These automatic updates would be provided at no-cost to the pilot.  The system would only send advisory information pertinent to the route of flight, before or during its operation, and would eliminate redundant information.  This system would be built around an integrated global database network to provide NAS-consistent information, relative to current aircraft position, and accessible through Internet connectivity.  Direct contact with Flight Service Specialists will be provided when the system will not accept a specific flight plan or when the pilot requires clarification or technical assistance in preflight planning and filing.  Preflight support will remain available via phone, radio or by the new 'Internet text chat' function.  Flight planning issues will be resolved quickly because the same source information will be seen by both pilot and Specialist, i.e, an integrated, interactive pilot web portal.
As currently envisioned by the FAA, MAPS services will be net-centric, and therefore widely available and with more current data. Not all enhancements are addressed in this document but several significant capabilities should illustrate the anticipated safety benefits of the new system. For example, a pilot could receive a text and/or graphics-based weather brief in the cockpit while warming up their engine on the ramp rather than relying on an hours-old brief obtained before departure. Also many pilots are reluctant to file Visual Flight Rules (VFR) flight plans out of concern that they may forget to close a flight plan and trigger a SAR false alarm.  Since MAPS will include an automatic reminder to close fight plans in addition to other enhancements, it is anticipated that a substantial increase in the number of pilots who file flight plans, receive weather briefings and fly will benefit from the increased situational awareness afforded by MAPS.
The web-based flight planning system, including an identical interface for pilot and Specialist, will ensure a shared situational awareness of the flight and the conditions expected to be encountered for the planned route.  MAPS will also provide applicable airspace restrictions and traffic management information.  Pilots will be able to enter their personal level of risk tolerance for a specific flight, e.g., highest acceptable intensity of turbulence, lowest layer of cloud cover and/or lowest visibility desired, probability of encounter, etc. This decision support tool will enable general aviation pilots and Flight Service Specialists to more accurately determine the impact of weather hazards upon their flight. Shared situational awareness and the integration of weather into decision support tools are key capabilities in the NextGen Concept of Operations.
Frequently-used flight plans, pilot contact  information, pilot preferences and aircraft capabilities will be stored in the MAPS system and may be used to auto populate flight plans.  After specifying the route of flight, aviation weather and aeronautical information will be accessed and provided in a standardized format from the FAA's authoritative sources.  Pilots will also be able to self-brief and/or download meteorological information as part of the flight plan briefing function.  Graphical, textual, and grid formats will be available.  Once the preflight briefing is complete, the pilot can subscribe to receive automatic information updates that occur after flight plan filing or post briefing, including items such as destination airport and alternate airport closures, new advisories for icing, turbulence, thunderstorms, etc.Once the flight plan has been filed in the system, critical changes to current or forecast meteorological and aeronautical information, e.g., urgent PIREPs, a new Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET), destination and alternate airport changes to/from IFR, TFRs, etc., will be sent automatically to pilots who subscribe to this free service and the condition impacts their planned flight.  These weather deltas will be provided as alerts to the pilot in a format chosen by the end-user. PIREP entry will be simplified, standardized in form, and easily accessed through voice-to-text capability.
Likewise, any critical aeronautical advisory changes in the NAS impacting the route of flight will also be generated automatically and forwarded to the pilot.  These deltas would include new or updated NOTAMs, destination and alternate airport closure, and TFRs that are applicable to the route of flight. Voice-to-text and text-to-voice capability will be available to minimize head down time for the pilot and increase situational awareness.  
Limiting Inflight communications to critical changes in aeronautical and meteorological information will reduce frequency congestion and alleviate the potential repetition of information that a pilot has previously received.  The automation system will also alert the Specialist if an automatic update cannot be sent or if it is rejected as undeliverable. Details of the active or passive acknowledgement processes will be determined after market survey during final requirements development.  
Pilots will be alerted to deviations from the filed flight plan and prompted to either return to the filed route of flight or amend the plan remotely.  This will reduce the number of deviation alerts sent to the Specialist and greatly reduce search and rescue response times.
The system will create a repository of information on VFR flight operations and track the flight planning services provided to those flights.  This transaction tracking capability will also automate the current En Route Flight Advisory Service (EFAS), enhance situational awareness for the support of SAR, and alleviate the necessity of re-transmitting information that has already been received by the pilot.  The system will maintain an accessible log all transactions.
Pilots may request flight plan monitoring. The system would then perform conformance monitoring and generate an alert to the pilot and the Specialist when an aircraft is out of conformance with its flight plan, allowing the pilot to amend the flight plan or return to the original route of flight. The intent is not to develop a separate flight plan tracker, but rather to request Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) information on VFR flights relative to their intended route of flight, using existing interfaces with En Route and Terminal automation.  
When the Specialist has a Radio Contact, he/she will enter the aircraft's Call Sign into MAPS and the system will identify any missing information required for a given flight. MAPS will allow any Specialist to see all information relevant to the flight and the information already provided to the pilot in a distinct format.   A logical outgrowth of the flight plan monitoring capability would be to expedite SAR operations using ADS-B location information. Initiating a SAR operation based on improved location data from aircraft (that are equipped with ADS-B and monitored by MAPS automation) will enable SAR operations to target search areas quickly and efficiently and thus greatly increase the probability of detection.  The search area will be greatly reduced which in turn will allow the search to be concentrated over a smaller area increasing the chances of finding a downed aircraft and improve post-accident survival rates.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Mid Atlantic Health Care Network (VISN 6) intends to negotiate a sole source commercial item procurement with MCV Hospitality House in Richmond Virginia.

VAMC Richmond requires the following: Lodging services are required for the transplant patients for all transplant pre and post appointments at the Richmond VA Transplant Center. An extended period of lodging is also required as the patients transplant status requires their location to be within a 6 hour driving radius or if Air Ambulance service is not available. This extended period of lodging has to be available to our non continental US transplant candidates. Lodging for the newly discharged transplant patient and their caregiver until patient is medically stable to be discharged home. Lodging provider must comply will all related regulations and VHA Directives including 2003-009 TEMPORARY LODGING AND HOPTEL PROGRAMS  and ORGAN TRANSPLANT  V HA Directive 2001-027.  Lodging must meet the unique medical needs of the transplant patient. Rooms to be equipped with special lodging needs the transplant patient may have; such as medical beds, sleep chairs, separate kitchen and storage facilities with key coded locked for each individual. Both pre and post operative control of infection is a critical element for this type of patients weakening medical condition. Having a control environment addressing their needs is essential to ensuring the success of the transplant or help to prevent the rejection of the transplanted organ. The close proximity to the VA Medical Center and Transplant Surgical Hospital is required post transplant due to frequent follow-up and monitoring until the patient is stable enough to return home within a couple of month. 

This proposed procurement is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement no later than Noon, 9/29/2010, local time. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>BACKGROUND

Audiology services appointments are an important part of the provision of VA care for both occupational and service-related hearing loss in the Veteran Population. Given VA's mission to provide convenient and accessible services to Veteran patients, the need to travel to the VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) that provide audiology services is a considerable burden on some Veteran patients. For a number of years VA has been tracking the state-of-the art with respect to teleaudiology, which enables audiology examinations to be conducted at a distance. Following detailed review of such a system by a panel of VA clinical and technical experts in July 2009, systems are available that will meet the needs of providing audiology services remotely to Veteran patients.
The VA is embarking on a teleaudiology pilot program to assess the feasibility of providing audiology services, including the programming of hearing aids, over the VA intranet.  In the base year of this contract, it is anticipated that an estimated 10 small community based outpatient clinics (COBC) will be equipped with mobile carts of video teleconferencing equipment, computer equipment, computer-based diagnostic equipment, and related software.  In addition, an estimated 5 VA Medical Centers will be equipped with corresponding video teleconferencing equipment to allow two-way interaction with the CBOC.  Although communications and remote connectivity infrastructure are not included in the pilot program, the carts will allow for interactive audio/video communications with an audiologist at a host VA Medical Center while the Audiologist remotely controls the computer and software on the cart.  The contractor will also provide the desktop video teleconferencing workstation needed by the audiologist.  The audiologist will control the equipment on the cart to conduct the patient examination provide consultation and, where necessary, reprogram/refit the patient's hearing aids.  There will be some variations of the specific equipment suite between carts based on compatibility with the individual Veterans Integrated Support Network's (VISN) existing teleconferencing equipment.  In the option years, if exercised, additional CBOCs and VA Medical Centers will be equipped to provide similar teleaudiology capabilities.

GENERAL INFORMATION

During the base year of the contract, the required equipment and services will establish teleaudiology capabilities at an estimated 10 CBOC sites and an estimated 5 VA Medical Centers for the VA National Teleaudiology Pilot.  Also during the base year, Phase I of this multi-phase pilot will focus on establishing the feasibility of remote programming of hearing aids with Phase II targeting remote audiometry. Subsequently, standardization of equipment, training, reporting mechanisms/outcomes, and procedures will be done to ensure the overall success of this pilot. 
Using a Teleaudiology infrastructure, control of the CBOC site computer is given to the audiologist located at the distant site medical center. In Phase I, this will allow the audiologist to open the hearing aid software and proceed with fitting or adjustment per current practice guidelines. Remote verification will be completed with a PC-based probe tube system ensuring prescriptive audibility needs are met. Verification equipment will also be controlled under the current Teleaudiology infrastructure.  An integrated telemedicine cart containing various peripheral equipment will be needed to cover a wide range of applications including the remote sharing of patient education materials (i.e. video-clips, high-resolution photographs), visualization of external auditory canal and tympanic membrane, as well as displaying a macro-view of items such as an inserted earmold/hearing aid(s) and orientation of probe tube reference microphone. Close-up views of various hearing aid landmarks will also be critical for troubleshooting hearing aid problems and reading identifying items such as a serial number.   
Phase II will utilize the same Teleaudiology infrastructure thus allowing control of a PC-based audiometer and immittance unit.  The audiologist will again be located at the distant site medical center. Comprehensive audiological testing consisting of air conduction, bone conduction, speech, tympanometry, and acoustic reflexes will be demonstrated through a teleconnections medium. Each telemedicine cart will provide the videoconferencing capabilities as well as use of standard peripheral equipment such as a video-otoscope.  
Flexibility will be critically important for network buy-in, requiring adaptation to each VISN's current videoconferencing scheme.

The contractor will be responsible for providing a fully integrated solution including, but not limited to, the cart, all equipment and software, delivery and installation, integration services, on-site training, maintenance, and warranty service for the community based outpatient clinics and for the equipment and software at the VA Medical Center.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS), no solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the US Government to form a binding contract. Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted. The Air Force is hereby soliciting capability statements from interested sources for the Engineering Services Contract in support of the F-5 and T-38 aircraft assigned to the F-5 and T-38 System Program Offices (SPOs) located at Hill AFB, UT.
<p>1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this SSS is to gather comments and potential sources for providing engineering and associated technical activities which may included, but are not limited to, the following tasks: develop/provide analysis, assessments, studies, component and system-level component design or testing to substantiate a new or improved component or sub-system capability, and provide configuration management support.

<p>2. BACKGROUND: The F-5 and T-38 are mature and proven aircraft, requiring specialized engineering to ensure system sustainment. The F-5 is currently not in use by the USAF, but it supported by the USAF through the Technical Coordination Group (TCG). The T-38 aircraft is in active use by the USAF, with a programmed retirement starting in 2020. To sustain the T-38 weapon system, the USAF fleet has undergone a number of modification programs since its initial acquisition and fielding by the AF in 1961. These include Pacer Classic I and II, the Avionics Upgrade Program (AUP), and the current Propulsion Modernization Program (PMP) and Escape System Upgrade Program (ESUP). Each of these programs has either replaced or repaired major structural and legacy systems and components.</p>

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is hereby soliciting information in regard topotential sources for a follow-on procurement to the Consolidated Information TechnologyServices (CONITS) Task Order (Number L-70750D) under the General ServicesAdministrations (GSA) Millennia Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC),GS-00T-99-ALD-0209, GSA Task Order Number T03-01-DS-L003.  The Langley Research Center(LaRC) Information Technology Enhanced Services (LITES) contract will be the follow-oneffort to the current CONITS task order.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do notrequest a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsizedin FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Services.  It is the potentialofferors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation orsynopsis. One of the primary goals of this synopsis is to assist NASA Langley in determiningwhether a Small Business Set-aside is an acceptable strategy for this procurement.  If afull and open competition is ultimately pursued, responses to this synopsis will be usedto aid in establishing small business subcontracting goals.  As no decision on aset-aside has yet been made, all qualified firms are encouraged to respond.  The NorthAmerican Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541513 andthe size standard under this code is average annual receipts of $25 Million.The LITES contract will provide computing support services for complex informationtechnology (IT) systems that are uniquely configured or highly specialized in functionand include state-of-the-art IT.  Systems supported include unique and high-end systemsused by Mission and Mission-support staff at LaRC. LITES will provide a wide range ofsupport functions including those for non-standard operating systems, for systeminterfaces, or for use within a dynamic environment such as a research laboratory or testfacility. LITES will provide integrated support that encompasses all activities(including system administration and hardware and software maintenance) necessary todevelop, deploy, upgrade, operate, and maintain a  system that delivers an IT capabilityfor research and development (R&D) use and business applications.LITES will also provide IT services incorporating new and emerging technologies that willevolve over the life of the contract.  The scope of support to be provided under LITES isintended to cover all requirements for "Information Technology" including computers,ancillary equipment, software, firmware, services, and related resources. Softwaredevelopment, operations, and maintenance under LITES apply to software at several levelsof risk and control from minimal to critical (as it relates to impact to the Government).No later than nine (9) months after the contract effective date, the successful offerorsquality system will be required to be Certified/Registered to the current ANSI/ISO/ASQCISO 9001 standard, Quality Management Systems Requirements.  In addition, no later thannine (9) months after the contract effective date, the successful offer (includingteaming partners/subcontractors) that will be performing software engineering will berequired to be CMMI for Development Capability Level 2 or higher as measured by aSoftware Engineering Institute (SEI) authorized lead appraiser from an externalorganization in the following Process Areas:(1)	Requirements Management(2)	Configuration Management(3)	Process and Product Quality Assurance(4)	Measurement and Analysis(5)	Project Planning(6)	Project Monitoring and Control(7)	Supplier Agreement ManagementThe IT systems supported under LITES are used in R&D computing and advanced engineeringsupport and business applications. The environment for the R&D activities is by naturevery fluid and evolutionary; often an unexpected result will focus the researchersattention in an entirely new direction. In order to maximize the ability to change coursequickly, the IT systems used by the researcher are subject to change and realignment. Tosupport these systems, LITES will require flexible staffing with high-level skills thatare continually reviewed with an eye toward emerging, cutting-edge technologies.Software development and maintenance under LITES will provide applications needed tosupport R&D and advanced engineering activities that are usually not well defined at theoutset. The applications tend to be evolutionary, gaining more focus on the goal as thecode is fine-tuned to the researchers requirements. It will be critical that theapplication administrator is well educated in the mission requirements as related to thespecific application. The process will rely on a high level of understanding of how theapplication functions within the system architecture and the potential impacts to ITsecurity once the application is brought online. The skills inherent in this type ofsupport are highly specialized and success will rely on a diverse mixture of severalskill sets. To illustrate the LITES environment, here are some specific examples of anticipatedrequirements:IT Security: This task provides LaRC with an incident response and computer forensicscapability; intrusion detection and monitoring capability; remote access compliance;support of IT system security plans; coordination of IT security activities with otherCenters; perimeter protection (including a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and firewall);and outreach. Key aspects of the task are the unknown day-to-day intrusions and threatsand the countermeasures needed to safeguard the Centers network. The task requires avariety of continuously evolving skills to address the dynamic nature of systemvulnerabilities. Specific projects arise on an ad hoc basis and must be addressed quicklyand skillfully.Computational Fluid Dynamics Lab Computer Administration: The lab computer systemconsists of a heterogeneous network of Linux and Unix servers, Linux and Unixworkstations, and high-end computer clusters that require system administration, systemtuning, and maintenance of network security and resource availability for NASA personnel,contractors, and grantees within and outside the LaRC network domain. Nodes supportedunder this task continue to grow dramatically; currently we have reached a total of 27physically distinct clusters and 52 sub-clusters consisting of 8,017 processing coressupported by LITES. As with any cutting edge technology, bugs will continue to bediscovered and corrected through extensive communication with the hardware vendorengineering and technical support staff. Advanced Engineering Environment Lab Operations: These tasks will provide support in theareas of data visualization, geometry modeling, and knowledge management. The GeometryLaboratory (GEOLAB) serves as a Center resource to the LaRC research community in dealingwith geometry and grid generation issues. The GEOLAB is an open shop facility with anon-site technical staff available to collaborate with researchers or to take on geometryrelated tasks. The geometry modeling and grid generation support provided includes theproduction of accurate geometry definitions and numerical grids for Computational FluidDynamics (CFD), Computational Structural Mechanics (CSM), and other engineering analyses.The GEOLAB typically supports 30 to 60 production and consultation tasks a year, with asmany as 100 geometry models, geometry comparisons, and structured and unstructured gridsdelivered as products. The majority of these tasks are production tasks of short durationand are accomplished within 2 to 6 weeks. The GEOLAB also develops software to facilitategeometry modeling and grid generation. The Data Visualization and Analysis Lab (DVAL) isa central, open shop resource available to meet the data analysis and scientificvisualization needs of the LaRC research community. The capabilities within the DVALinclude development of immersive, collaborative virtual environments; flow featureextraction techniques; visualization systems for generating computer visualizations, bothstills and animations; methods for visual comparisons of experimental and computationaldatasets; and image/data reduction tools and techniques. In addition, the DVAL expertiseincludes software development capabilities to produce custom software tools tailored tothe unique requirements of the customer. Application areas cover a wide variety ofdisciplines including computational fluid dynamics, computational structures, atmosphericmodeling, remote sensing, materials science, and experimental fluid dynamics. For theGEOLAB and DVAL, all work is specific to the individual research customer on an as-neededbasis, resulting in a great variation in workload and staffing over the course of theyear.Airspace and Traffic Operations Simulation (ATOS) Development and Enhancements: Theobjective of this task will be to develop and enhance NASA-Langley Research CentersAirspace and Traffic Operations Simulation, including methodologies to enable researchexperiments in support of future air transportation system concepts and technologies suchas those currently being explored by NASAs Airspace Systems Program projects (NextGenAirspace and NextGen Airportal).  Tasks will explore new methodologies for thedevelopment and enhancement of distributed airborne simulation tools, design and developnew engineering models of revolutionary and enabling airborne technologies, integratethese new simulation tools and engineering models into the ATOS, and aid in the conductof simulations (including experiment design, data analysis, and reporting). Theoverarching goal will be to produce and maintain an integrated, operational, andproductive Air Traffic Management (ATM) research tool that also incorporates capabilitiesfor transitioning to simulations of airport surface operations.Research goals will be met through studies and experiments conducted using the ATOS(hosted in the Air Traffic Operations Lab, or ATOL, at LaRC) as well as with othersimulation tools that may be linked to the ATOS for specific experiments.  These researchgoals include  (1) evaluating the impact of uncertainties, real-world system behaviors,weather, and human factors on the safety and performance of airborne trajectorymanagement applications; (2) developing new 4D dynamic Required Navigation Performance(RNP) capabilities and determining how they may affect the performance of variousairborne applications integrated with ground-based operations; (3) creating new metricsfor dynamic airspace complexity and evaluating the effects of various distributedcomplexity-mitigation functions and en-route coordination strategies; and (4) evaluatingdifferent algorithms and procedures for super-density terminal area merging and spacingapplications. In the area of airport surface operations, research goals include (1)evaluating Collision Avoidance for Airport Traffic (CAAT) algorithms in the low altitude,runway, and taxiway operating environment; (2) evaluating integrated aircraft-based CAATand ground-based taxi conformance monitoring and longer term collision detection andresolutions solutions; and (3) developing and evaluating algorithms and procedures tomaximize airport arrival and departure capacity, including reduced in-trail separationrequirements, closely-spaced and converging/intersecting runway operations, and runwaybalancing.Development, implementation, and integration of new simulation capabilities will berequired to perform vital studies and experiments in support of planned research goals.These simulation capabilities generally fall into the following categories: (1)development of engineering models of advanced technologies that enable new concepts ofoperation, such as airborne four-dimensional (4D) trajectory & separation management,terminal area merging and spacing, and in-trail procedures (oceanic and domestic) forenroute climbs and descents; (2) new 4D trajectory generation capability for the on-boardflight management computer (FMC), including a common lexicon for the exchange of 4Dtrajectory data between various airborne and ground-based systems and applications; (3)advancements in the simulation of the basic aircraft, including airframe and engineperformance models and control laws; (4) improvements to fundamental simulation controlfunctions, including timing, mode transitions, and scenarios, that support the full rangeof experiment types from real-time human-in-the-loop studies to large-scale batch runs;and (5) evaluation of algorithms and procedures for airport arrival and departureoperations.High Performance Computing and Distributed Systems: LITES supports several highperformance computing programs and projects. The systems that these activities requireare current, state-of-the-art computing systems that utilize a variety of computerhardware, operating systems, and applications codes. The major requirements for thesupport of high performance computing specific to this work area include providing expertconsulting services on the application of high performance hardware and softwaresolutions for Langleys programs and projects; administering organizational level andCenter computer level systems used primarily for the production of engineering data wherelarge numbers of processors, large memories, or extensive data management is required tomeet Langley engineering and scientific goals; facilitating the development, debugging,performance analysis, and optimization of user and system-wide applications; developingperformance metrics, benchmarking, testing, and evaluating new architectures and softwareto meet current and future needs; administering Langley parallel and clusteredcomputational or  application servers with state-of-the-art architectures; supportingspecialized libraries for system or software development for high performance computingarchitecture; supporting specialized applications codes for use on high performancecomputing architecture; and developing unique solutions to isolate, eliminate, ormitigate information technology-centric problems in engineering and scientificapplications. In addition there are distributed systems consisting of clusters ofnetworked computers and associated equipment, located at various sites throughout theCenter, which are used in specific experimental or analytical environments.   Theseclusters are used by small groups of researchers or engineers with particular specialtiessuch as computational fluid dynamics, computational structures, engineering design anddevelopment, modeling and simulation, software development, and other IT intensiveapplications. Geographic Information System: Geographic Information System (GIS) is an intuitivespatial data management and decision support tool. Institutional managers are the currentprimary users of data and processes, but use of the technology by researchers is on therise. The spatial information management system is built around a relational databaseconsisting of data that includes or is derived from such records as: aerial photographs,topographic maps, descriptions and engineering drawings of buildings and facilities,utility plats, geological data, climatic records, financial data, and personnel locatorrecords.  The location of objects to the level of individual offices is given with highaccuracy in coordinates derived from the satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS).GIS at Langley integrates functions from institutional databases with the goal ofincreasing the accuracy and sustainability of data. The database can be interactivelyqueried through web pages to extract up-to-date maps or plans restricted to selectedfeatures or to produce reports relating selected data.	Automated space allocationoptimization is an area where spatial data technologies are being applied to increaseoverall efficiency and effectiveness. Requirements to support GIS include providingintegrated support of the GIS systems; updating and enhancing GIS databases; providingfield observation, network solutions, equipment readiness, and report generation insupport of GPS data gathering and use; developing and enhancing software products for thedisplay, maintenance, and publication of building spatial data; and developing newsoftware tools and maintaining existing tools to support the activities of the GIS using.NET and ArcGIS Server technologies.Large Scale Data Storage and Retrieval System:	The Contractor shall support the CentralStorage System (CSS).  The CSS provides large-scale, network-accessible storage for LaRC. CSS is the next generation of the Distributed Mass Storage System (DMSS).

<DESC>Subject:  Request for Information for providing the United States Marine Corps a Comprehensive Study to Baseline its Operational Energy Use and to Provide Recommended Metrics to Manage / Monitor/ Analyze Future Operational Energy Employment.

Purpose:  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct market research for use in formulating and acquisition strategy to support the reporting and operational energy budget validation requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 2009, Section 902.  As stated the NDAA 2009, the term ``operational energy means the energy required for training, moving, and sustaining military forces and weapons platforms for military operations.
  The term includes energy used by tactical power systems and generators and weapons platforms.  The Marine Corps does not have a central process owner or metric(s) to measure and report operational energy.  The results of this RFI will support the development of a comprehensive understanding of operational energy in the Marine Corps and the metrics that can be used to measure, analyze, and manage operational energy employment.  These metrics will be used to: A) Identify and target key drivers of Marine Corps energy use; B) Provide insights to target change initiatives within the organization, e.g., guide materiel and non-materiel program investments; C) Inform tactical and operational decisions; and D) Enable program risk assessment.
  Ultimately, this understanding will lead to better informed budgeting decisions regarding operational energy and reporting as required by NDAA 2009. 

Responses to this RFI shall not exceed seven (7) pages that include the cover letter, discussion and contact information.  Subject responses must contain: (1) Capability statement sufficient to demonstrate performance acumen directly related to the objectives stated above; (2) Two customer citations describing similar work efforts; (3) Link to respondents appropriate GSA Schedules, if applicable, or other Government-Wide Acquisition Contract vehicles such as Seaport-e; and (4) Other material relevant to establishing the core competencies of the firm.
  Please identify Large/Small Business size status.

Response is due by Friday, October 8, 2010, 1200 p.m., EST.  Please submit e-mail responses to Mr. Bradford L. Backus, Customer Liaison at email address:  bradford.backus@usmc.mil.

Notes: Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation whatsoever on the part of the Government to procure these services or to issue a solicitation.  The Marine Corps is neither seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers.  Any information the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such.  The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.
  See FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning purposes.  Insert: Information ONLY.

<a href="mailto:graham.oliff@usmc.mil">graham.oliff@usmc.mil</a>
<DESC>Marine Corps System Command, Program Manager for Training Systems is seeking information from potential responsible sources capable of providing reconfigurable Operator Driver Simulators (ODSs) used to provide both entry level and sustainment level training for USMC operators.   

Program Background: 
The USMC-ODS is a computer based, reconfigurable operator driving simulator used to provide both entry level and sustainment level training for USMC operators.  In all configurations, the fidelity of the USMC-ODS shall provide student operators with immersive and realistic experiences in operating the selected vehicle during both on/off road, and differing degrees of weather conditions scenarios.
 With the current USMC-ODS system's MTVR and MTVR-MAS software as a baseline, this procurement effort incorporates the Up-Armored HMMWV and MRAP Cougar (Category I, 4x4 and Category II, 6x6) and Buffalo (6x6,Category III) to provide additional training capabilities.

The USMC-ODS systems are currently in service at Camp Pendleton, CA, Camp Lejeune, NC, Enhanced Mojave Viper (29 Palms, CA), Hawaii, Okinawa, Iwakuni and at 20 selected Marine Reserves units throughout the CONUS.  There are currently 31 systems fielded.  

Potential Scope of Work may include the following: 
The purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research survey that will identify potential sources, capabilities, and interest in the program, and assist in developing an acquisition strategy to meet Government requirements.
 The scope of this RFI is expanding the training capabilities of the MTVR ODS and to establish a common baseline amongst the ODS located in the formal schoolhouses at Camp Johnson, NC and Ft. Leonard Wood, MO by replacing the current vehicle cabs with reconfigurable vehicle cabs.  The reconfigurable vehicle cabs shall allow the schoolhouses to provide HMMWV and MRAP operator/driver training in addition to the current MTVR capability.  The reconfigurable vehicle cab upgrade will be compatible with the current software and programmatic baseline without modifying the existing ODS system.  Only hardware modifications and changes will be made under this effort, no software changes. Hardware changes shall include, but will not be limited to, reconfigurable vehicle cabs, interchangeable faux armor panels to replicate vehicles lines of sight, and vehicle specific dash panels and steering wheels.
   The reconfigurable vehicle cab upgrade will bring the MTVR ODS configuration in line with the USMC ODS configuration.  In all configurations, the fidelity of the ODS shall provide student operators with immersive and realistic experiences in operating the selected vehicle during both on/off road, and differing degrees of weather conditions scenarios. This training is required to ensure Marines are properly trained prior to deployment for real world military operations.


The contractor would be tasked with potentially providing some or all of the following services/supplies: 

1. Program Management Support: Includes participation in Government directed development of price and availability of upgrade components; internal project management and associated accounting using the Earned Value Management System.

2 Scheduling, document preparation and on-site representation at Government or contractor facilities, as directed.
 

3. Technical Support: To include participation and subject matter assistance in Government led design/production engineering, engineering analyses, quality management, configuration management, value engineering, reliability and maintainability, systems safety, system integration, and test and evaluation. 

4. Acquisition Logistics: To include all disciplines required to assist the Government with comprehensive logistics assessments for systems/subsystems/components, inclusive of supportability goals, cost/performance trades, and life-cycle cost. 

This request for information in no way implies either implicitly or explicitly that respondents will be compensated in any way by the U.S.
 Government for information or materials provided. It does not constitute a solicitation and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. All information provided becomes USMC property and will not be returned. All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately. Submissions received after the due date may or may not be reviewed. All potential offerors; regardless of providing comments or not, need to provide an email to Graham Oliff at: graham.oliff@usmc.mil.

The incumbent shall develop a plan and budget estimate to define how the DIACAP process will be accomplished on LTMS, and what the expected cost to the government will be. This estimate shall include cost of changes to the LTMS application that must be made in order to achieve the C&amp;A, and any documentation changes required as a result of these application changes. This plan and budget estimate shall be delivered to the government no later than 31 March 2011.<br />3.0 GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY AND SERVICES<br />3.1. The LTMS System<br />The Logistics Test Management System, which is a government owned and operated, web based, software application, is used for the management and execution of the Logistics Test &amp; Evaluation (LT&amp;E) process.<br />3.2. Configuration Management <br />The 412 MXLS has designed a Configuration Management (CM) tool within the MS Excel application. The incumbent shall be required to utilize this, or a similar tool to manage and communicate LTMS changes and change status with the government PM. Identification of specific problems or enhancements on this tool does not constitute authority to work, but rather only identifies the work that the government is interested in having performed. Authority to begin work on any line item within the tool will be communicated to the incumbent by the PM through email.</p>
<p>Please note that this is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirement are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the required supply described above.</p>

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command  Fort Hood intends to issue a sole-source purchase order to Actus Design and Technical Svc, 1801 West End Ave, Suite 1700, Nashville, TN 37203.  The requirement is to provide a detailed cost estimate for both the demolition of family housing units to accommodate the proposed widening of US190 in the vicinity of Pershing Park and the scope and cost of the technical, administrative, and legal procedures necessary to change the numerous agreements among the Army, Lend Lease Actus (LLA) and third parties to effect and reflect the demolition and replacement action.  The number of buildings to be demolished is 12 duplexes (24 units).  Lend Lease Actus (LLA) serves as the Armys partner in the Residential Communities Initiative (RCI) at Fort Hood.  LLA and its technical arm, Actus Design and Technical Svc, have managed the repair, renovation, and maintenance of the affected buildings since 2001, and possess both thorough and proprietary data about the buildings, their construction, and their demolition and potential replacement.  Since LLA will actually execute said demolition and potential replacement under condemnation, the agreements, or both, only LLA can provide an estimate to which LLA will be bound.  Further, the numerous agreement documents requiring review and planning for modification are not all public documents, and a third party would not be allowed to review, let alone plan to modify, those voluminous and wide-ranging documents.  Finally, LLA has exclusive rights to perform Design work for the partnership, further disabling the authority of any other estimator.<BR>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source procurement action and is not a request for competitive proposals.  The NAICS code is 561990- All Other Support Services, with a size standard of $7.0 million.  Firms who want to challenge the sole source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates your firm's ability to provide an equivalent service as described above. Interested parties must provide rationale as to why they should be considered. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion for the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Directorate of Contracting will not reimburse for any costs connected with providing the capability information.  All interested firms must respond to this synopsis by Tuesday, September 28, 2010 at 12:00 noon CST, via e-mail to Leeann Burke, Contracting Officer, at leeann.burke@us.army.mil.

<DESC>Task Order No. R10PD80R26 against IDIQ Contract No. R10PC80475Project Title: Construction Inspection Weber SiphonsTAS::14 0681::TASBOR Project No. 7.0000Award Amount:$385,093.08Award Date: 9/27/2010Vendor - HPC, DUNS 058175170 1746 Cole Blvd Ste 225, Golden, CO 80401-3208.Task Order Description:  Construction inspection services for the Weber Branch Siphon and Weber Coulee Siphon construction projects located in central Washington near Ephrata.
The above task order was issued as a labor hour task order. In accordance with Department of the Interior Guidance Release ARRA-2010-01 contracting officers should consider placement of a task or delivery order against a bureau's or a DOl-wide Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract. This task order is against the Bureau of Reclamation Denver Acquisition Operations Group multiple award ID/IQ for Professional Services,  R10PC80475 with HPC an SBA Certified 8(a) business.
A labor hour task order was determined to be appropriate for this requirement and no other contract type is suitable. The elements of consideration, prescribed by FAR 12.207 to be used as guidelines to assess whether or not a labor hour contract is appropriate for this acquisition and that no other contract type is suitable, and the facts related to this acquisition are presented below.
a. Market research has revealed the required services are a commercial service, available under the Bureau of Reclamation, Acquisition Operations Group, Multiple Award Professional Services ID/IQ contract with HPC. HPC has a successful past performance record providing professional services under labor hour type contracts for Bureau of Reclamation and numerous other federal agencies.  b. In this particular situation, it is not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence because the inspection services are required as long as construction is underway. The exact completion date of construction is unknown due to the high possibility of delays inherent in construction projects of this nature (i.e. weather, unforeseen site conditions, etc.). The anticipated construction completion date is December 31, 2011. 
c. In order to maximize the use of firm fixed price this delivery order will utilize pre-priced firm fixed price hourly labor rates and will include a ceiling price based on the best estimate of the number of hours that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. The contractor shall be required to notify the government immediately when the total amount invoiced is expected to exceed 75% of the total amount of the order. Estimated travel-related costs and any other direct costs not covered in the labor hour rates will be reimbursed based on allowable costs in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulation.
d. There will be adequate Government surveillance of contractor performance conducted by Reclamation's Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR will communicate daily with the construction inspector via e-mail and cell phone.  Each day the construction inspector will transmit a daily inspector report which will describe the work performed by the contractor, and identify any observed problems, etc.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">UT-Battelle, LLC, acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the management and operation of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), conducts research and development (R&amp;D) in support of the DOE Office of Industrial Technologies Program (ITP).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ITP's mission is to lead the national drive to reduce energy intensity and carbon emissions by changing the way industry uses energy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ORNL is requesting from industrial partners R&amp;D proposals to enter Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) that promote and enhance the objectives of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, P.L. 111-5, especially economic recovery in an expeditious manner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only projects that promote economic recovery, assist those impacted by the recession, or provide general economic benefit will be selected. The selected projects will be conducted under CRADAs between UT-Battelle and the industrial partners.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">Selected projects will focus on advanced materials and processing methods for photovoltaic applications and will be conducted over a 6-month period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The industrial partner is required to provide at least 50% cost share, which can be funds-in to ORNL or in-kind contributions (e.g., facilities, services, and staff time).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ORNL will not provide any funds to the industrial partner.<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"> Note: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.</strong></span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6pt"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">Eligibility</span></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">Eligibility is limited to U.S. industries that currently manufacture or process solar materials for commercial applications or that will be able to do so as a direct result of these collaborative efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no restriction based on a particular material system or generation of solar cell technology.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">Background</span></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">The efficient conversion of sunlight to electricity represents both a grand technical challenge as well as a tremendous opportunity for clean, abundant energy. The sun delivers more energy to the earth in an hour than the population of the world uses in an entire year, but it accounts for less than 1% of the renewable energy produced in the U.S.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">In order for solar energy to gain widespread acceptance, it must be cost competitive with other forms of electricity currently on the market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for solar technology is currently on the order of $0.20/kWh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In order for solar energy to achieve grid parity with other forms of electricity, the LCOE must be reduced by a factor of 3-4, to roughly $0.07/kWh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The primary metrics impacting LCOE at the solar cell level are performance (efficiency) and manufacturing cost, which are generally tightly coupled together.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">The solar energy sector has been growing rapidly over the past several years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the past 7 years, the solar sector has enjoyed annual growth rates in excess of 30% -- actually exceeding 50% in the past 2 years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, in the midst of such progress, the U. S. has lost market share internationally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the US led the world in manufacturing of solar systems in 1997, the US market share has fallen below 10% in recent years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB">However, the US currently leads the world in thin film PV production (~66% market share), which is an area that can be exploited to increase the overall market share in the future.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">Objective</span></strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">The ORNL objective is to collaborate with manufacturers to investigate, improve, and scale process methodology for the manufacture of high efficiency and low cost solar cells.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Creation and preservation of domestic manufacturing jobs is a primary goal of this solicitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Awards will be granted in one or more of the following categories.</span></p>

<DESC>This announcement is a brand name or equal request for quotes and any quotes received must meet the specifications listed below for direct exposure two photon laser lithography system for three dimensional patterning with resolution of 140nm or better. The government has a requirement for a true 3D micro- and nanostructuring of photosensitive media, e.g. organic photoresists (like SU-8, IP-L, IP-G), hybrid materials (ormocere) or the amorphous semiconductor As2S3 - materials which are capable of 2-photon polymerization/exposure allowing for three dimensional arbitrary patterns to be written into single thick layers of resist. Other specifications include: Patterning of a 250 micron cubic volume at maximum resolution is required and large area patterns composed of overlaid volumes over a minimum area of 10cm^2. Patterning at 780nm with a supplied laser system is required based on compatibility with intended resist systems in addition to those provided with the system, as well as, the possibility of adding a second outboard exposure laser. Objectives required for patterning are both an oil immersion (na=1.4) for patterning at maximum resolution and air (na=0.75) for patterning over large areas and rapid scanning. An additional key aspect of this requirement is the drive control and interface that allows for non-skilled users to operate the system, design/render structures for patterning, control instrument exposure parameters, script instrument operation for batch and large area processing. Sample holders for 1" and 2" diameter samples, 5" square samples, 3"x1" (standard microscope slide) samples and 1.5"x1" (half of a standard microscope slide) should be provided with multiple samples per holder where possible. A highly automated instrument control system is required, including automated registration, focus control and interface identification. An imaging camera is required to allow for in-situ observation of exposures. In order to be compatible with the intended laboratory conditions an enclosed "maintenance free system" with class I laser operation, isolation table and remote instrument control system are required. Furthermore, this system should provide liquid resists, positive and negative as well as proven compatibility with semiconductor, commercial resists like SU-8 and ormosils to further seal it. This solicitation is a request for quotations. All quotations shall indicate how produce proposed meets the specifications above in order to be considered. Pricing for shipping must be included and clearly stated in the quote. This RFQ is issued under simplified acquisition procedures. The size standard for this effort is 500 employees. NAICS 334516. FOB: destination. Payment Terms Net 30 days: Evaluation of Award will be based on overall Best Value to the Government. <br />ATTN: The following clauses and provisions apply:<br />52.212-4 Contract terms and conditions - Commercial Items<br />52.212-5 Contract terms and Conditions required to implement statutes or executive orders - commercial items<br />252.212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items<br />Wide Area Workflow. <br />

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number R10PS40075 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-43. This is a total small business set-aside under NAICS 541690 with an associated small business size standard of $7M.
Project Goal:  Provide Upper Rio Grande Water Operations Model (URGWOM) support services to evaluate potential proposed actions in support of a new Biological Assessment/Biological Opinion (BA/BiOp) for the Middle Rio Grande and/or to provide modeling of additional alternatives as directed by Collaborative Program (Program) representatives of the Population Habitat Viability Assessment Ad Hoc Workgroup.
Background on project needs:  Due to the hydrologic, administrative, and legal constraints on water supplies along the Rio Grande, the waters of the Rio Grande were managed intensively for most of the 19th and 20th centuries.  More recent environmental laws and ensuing litigation further constrained water management in the basin.  The current 2003 BiOp (USFWS, March 13, 2003) is not considered to be hydrologically sustainable and efforts are underway to reinitiate Endangered Species Act consultation and to develop a new BA.  
Anticipated scope of project:  The Program is seeking to identify alternate options for managing water, diversions, and depletions within the basin.  The outcome of stakeholder negotiations and commitments will help identify the details of a new proposed action.  The URGWOM model is one of the tools used to identify water impacts of the proposed action.  Potential changes to current actions may include changes in: the operation and management of various system reservoirs; agricultural and municipal project diversions; Rio Grande Compact water releases; re-regulation of water for Pueblos; water leasing, and modification to same-year and multi-year goals addressing biological needs, etc. The decision identifying the elements of the proposed action is anticipated in the Fall of 2010 and will require fast-turnaround, interactive modeling and analysis to support preparation of the BA.  
The first work task is to update the URGWOM model input dataset to include 2009 hydrologic data including inflows, diversions, and outflows throughout the model domain.  To the extent practicable, the 2009 model data sets should reflect the final data products after implementation of the originating organization's quality assurance/quality control process.
It is anticipated that up to five alternate water operations scenarios may be identified for modeling, with each scenario to be evaluated using five 10-year hydrologic sequences and with and without considering an unlimited water supply.  The offeror shall also develop or modify tools (such as spreadsheets) to streamline output processing and comparison of water operations scenarios, including graphics demonstrating spawning/recruitment flows, overbanking flows, river drying, hydrographs at key river gages, changes in reservoir storage, changes in individual water accounts, Compact compliance, etc.   Documentation shall accompany each set of model runs to reflect changes in assumptions, rules, flow tools, and other model conditions.
In the event that a new proposed action is not identified by December 2010, URGWOM modeling may be used to assist with other Program modeling needs as identified by the Population Habitat Viability Assessment Ad Hoc workgroup.  Potential projects may include sensitivity analyses of various flow tools and operational strategies, optimization related to water management, and model upgrades related to rules and automating data management.  
Meetings and Reporting requirements:  The following meetings are anticipated in coordination with the Population Viability Habitat Analysis Ad Hoc workgroup schedule: 
1) initial meeting with Program representatives before the onset of work (1 meeting);  2) monthly workgroup meetings to present updates concerning modeling progress (11 meetings);  3) quarterly joint meetings with other Program workgroups (4 meetings);  4) a draft report two months prior to completion accompanied by a presentation to Program representatives ( 1 meeting); and 5) presentation of the final report incorporating the Program's comments on the draft report (1 meeting).  
The draft and final reports shall include documentation of the model runs performed including a description of each run, baseline, initial conditions, assumptions, rule changes, results, and conclusions. Draft and final reports will be prepared to summarize the conceptualization, modeling, analysis, comparisons among water operations scenarios and results.  The report shall summarize the impacts of each alternative as they relate to potential benefits regarding supplemental water usage and ecosystem needs.  Where applicable, compliance with BiOp requirements and Rio Grande Compact deliveries will be noted. URGWOM model run data files will also be provided to the Program.   Three hard copies and three electronic copies of the draft and final reports shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative. It is anticipated that the project schedule will extend for one calendar year from date of award.  The draft report is due 320 days from date of award; Program reviewers shall have a 14 calendar day review period.  The final report is due 365 days from date of award.
The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial applies to this acquisition. By the provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, technical capability of equipment and labor to meet the described government need, and price will be evaluated equally. It is advised that a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items be submitted along with the offer; the provision may also be completed online by accessing http://orca.bpn.gov. The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items applies. No addenda are enclosed. The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The following additional FAR clauses also apply: 52.204-06, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number; 52.204-07, Central Contractor Registration; 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside.

1 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (APR 2008)  

As prescribed in 4.1105, use the following clause:

   (a) Definitions. As used in this clause_ 

_Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database_ means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. 

_Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number_ means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. 

_Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number_ means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. 

_Registered in the CCR database_ means that_ 

(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and 

(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record _Active_. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process. 

(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. 

(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation _DUNS_ or _DUNS +4_ followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror_s name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. 

(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. 

(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number_ 

(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or 

(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. 

(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: 

(i) Company legal business. 

(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. 

(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and ZIP Code. 

(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and ZIP Code (if separate from physical). 

(v) Company Telephone Number. 

(vi) Date the company was started. 

(vii) Number of employees at your location. 

(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. 

(ix) Line of business (industry). 

(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). 

(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. 

(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. 

(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government_s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 

(g) 

(1) 

(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, _doing business as_ name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day_s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. 

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the _Suspension of Payment_ paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 

(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor_s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the _Suspension of payment_ paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 

(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757. 

                                                            (End of clause)

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
  The following factors shall be used to further evaluate those offers which the contracting officer has determined to be responsible:  

     (i) PAST PERFORMANCE
    (ii) PRICE

PAST PERFORMANCE Factor 1

The Government intends to evaluate the quality of the offerors past performance.  This evaluation of past performance is separate and distinct from the Contracting Officers responsibility determination.  The assessment of the offerors past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the capability of the offeror to successfully meet the requirements of the solicitation and as measurement of performance risk for contract award.  Offerors who are rated unsatisfactory will not be evaluated for price as they will not be eligible for award.
  However, for those offerors who received satisfactory past performance factor (i), PAST PERFORMANCE, is equal to Factor (ii), PRICE.  

(b) The Governments assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offerors performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the Government after it considers all available, relevant, and recent information.  

(c)  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation (see Clause N00244L335).
  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. 

Offerors are encouraged to provide information on prior contracts that are highly relevant to the scope, complexity, widely distributed geographical area, and dollar value of the washer/dryer maintenance service acquisition.  This includes certification of any personnel who will be at the sites to perform repairs services on all washers and dryers makes and models.  

Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.

UNSATISFACTORY:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.

PRICE  Factor 2

(a) The Government will evaluate offers annual preventive maintenance costs and proposed hourly rate for repairs.  Evaluation will be based on review of the CLINS by adding the total price for all options.
  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options(s).  Failure to propose on the base and all options years will render the offeror ineligible for award.

For evaluation purposes only, offerors are instructed to cost out a six-month option at the end of the last options period.  This cost will be added to the total cost to determine the overall cost for the effort for EVALUATION PURPOSES ONLY.  The six-month option can be submitted as a separate sheet.  The contract will be awarded at the total cost for a base period and three one-year options.  

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussion with Offerors.
  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms.

(f)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(g)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

PRICE- 

The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). Failure to propose on the base and all option years will render the offeror ineligible for award.

<p><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>POC: Nina Patel, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009. eThekwini Smart Metering Project. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to evaluate the technical, financial, environmental, and other critical aspects of integrating an advanced electricity metering, or smart metering, system into the existing and planned electricity distribution and customer information systems that are managed by eThekwini Electricity (TE), the electricity distribution company for eThekwini Municipality in South Africa.</p>
<p>Decades of underinvestment in South Africa's electric power infrastructure have left the country with a dangerously low electricity reserve margin. To address this situation, the Government of South Africa (GoSA) is investing in new power generation capacity, as well as energy efficiency and demand side management programs.</p>
<p>One of several demand side management programs that GoSA is encouraging is the adoption of advanced electricity metering, or smart metering, systems. In August 2008, the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) issued a requirement that all electricity distributors in South Africa implement smart metering systems encompassing all customers with monthly consumption of 500 kilowatt hours (kWh) or more by January 1, 2012. TE and other electricity distributors throughout South Africa are currently in the process of developing strategies to meet this requirement. TE is planning an initial rollout that will target approximately 43,000 customers that consume more than 1,000 kWh per month. This initial rollout will serve as a pilot project for the extension of smart metering to more than 300,000 TE customers that consume between 500 and 1000 kWh per month. TE's smart metering system will also serve as an example for the implementation of smart metering programs throughout South Africa, as well as other countries in the region.</p>
<p>The feasibility study will evaluate the technical, financial, environmental, and other critical aspects of integrating a smart metering system into TE's existing and planned electricity distribution and customer information systems. The feasibility study will also provide recommendations on meter technology, customer education, load controls, and pricing mechanisms and will develop technical specifications for a smart metering system that will enable TE to comply with NERSA's smart metering requirements. Finally, the feasibility study will provide recommendations to NERSA to help improve its smart metering regulations based on the findings of the viability of NERSA's existing smart metering regulations in eThekwini.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $446,500 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report, is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<p><br />Proposal Submission Place:<br />Mr. Lewis A. Lakeman<br />Assistant Vice President, Systems Development &amp; Planning<br />National Water Commission (NWC)<br />Finance &amp; Administrative Division<br />18 Oxford Road<br />Kingston 5<br />Jamaica, West Indies<br />Telephone: (876) 929-5430</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to carry out technical assistance to enable the NWC to improve its ability to evaluate wastewater treatment facility upgrade needs in order to comply with environmental regulations and to improve wastewater treatment facility performance.</p>
<p>BRIEF PROJECT BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF GRANTEE</p>
<p>The NWC is the primary provider of water and wastewater management services in Jamaica and collects wastewater from well over 600,000 people across the island. The NWC is a Jamaican statutory body that was established in 1980 as a result of the National Water Commission Act. The Government of Jamaica (GOJ) is undergoing a program for improving environmental conditions and overall performance at facilities such as wastewater treatment plants throughout the country. Many of the country's treatment facilities have reached their full life expectancy or have deteriorated to a point where their performance is not meeting design intent or regulatory limits.</p>
<p>The NWC currently operates more than 79 sewerage facilities throughout the island. A variety of treatment technologies are used in these facilities, including contact stabilization, oxidation ditches, extended aeration, aerated lagoons and stabilization ponds. The historical application of the regulations has not led to sufficient monitoring of wastewater treatment plant function and performance to a point where the design intent of the facilities has not been sustained. As a result, many of the existing treatment facilities in Jamaica are in need of improvement or rehabilitation to function properly.</p>
<p>This Technical Assistance is one of two activities brought to USTDA by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in connection with the Caribbean Regional Fund for Wastewater Management (CReW), which is financed and managed by the IDB, in partnership with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Through the CReW, the IDB and its partners seek to test innovative financing approaches to support the development of wastewater management projects throughout the Caribbean, beginning with the implementation of five pilot projects or programs, including a pilot program to be undertaken in Jamaica (the "Jamaica Pilot"). The NWC has assembled a list of ten wastewater facilities under the pilot that are considered a high priority for rehabilitation as "immediate" projects, primarily on the basis of the condition of the plants and the extent of their impact on the environment and public health. The NWC envisions a master trust in conjunction with the IDB for the pledging of K-factor revenues (i.e., a special surcharge for purposes of identified and monitored projects) for the refurbishment, upgrade, and/or expansion of wastewater facilities.</p>
<p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF STUDY COMPONENTS</p>
<p>This Technical Assistance supports the IDB's goal of ensuring that the anticipated $300 million in Jamaica Pilot projects funded using K-factor revenues are effectively and efficiently developed and implemented and that the wastewater facilities are operated based on all applicable policies, procedures, standards and laws. In an effort to improve the Grantee's ability to evaluate wastewater treatment facility upgrade needs to comply with environmental regulations and improve wastewater treatment facility performance, this TA entails: (i) identifying areas in procurement, construction, technology selection, and operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) where the applicable policies, procedures, standards and laws are not being implemented appropriately at three reference wastewater facilities; (ii) providing recommendations on improvements or actions needed; and (iii) preparing an evaluation criteria checklist consistent with Jamaican laws and regulations to be approved by Grantee. The Contractor will also document the general condition of the equipment (e.g., electrical, mechanical, process, and HVAC) at each of the three reference wastewater facilities.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $150,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Combined Synopsis/Solicitation for COPD Research with the University of Michigan

(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is VA-241-10-RQ-0749. 

The VA intends to issue a sole-source contract to an affiliate, the University of Michigan, 3003 South State, Room 1044, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-1274 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. 

48 CFR 873.104(a)  which provides: "Without regard to FAR Part 6, if the health-care resource required is a commercial service, the use of medical equipment or space, or research, and is to be acquired from an institution affiliated with the Department in accordance with section 7302 of title 38 U.S.C., including medical practice groups and other approved entities associated with affiliated institutions (entities will be approved if determined legally to be associated with affiliated institutions), or from blood banks, organ banks, or research centers, the resource may be acquired on a sole source basis."

However, the VA wants to make sure we explore all possibilities so if you have a similar solution please respond to this combined synopsis/solicitation.

This requirement is not set aside; it is conducted under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The NAICS Code is 611420.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, has a requirement for an internet site to be used in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) research.  A portion of this research project will require the adaptation and maintenance of  an Internet website to be used in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) research.

Researchers at the University of Michigan have created the Internet website and interface to which study participants can upload step count data, participate in an online community forum, receive tailored step count goals and motivational messages, and receive health and fitness information.  This unique system is not available elsewhere. 

The program developed by the University of Michigan is unique and different in that 
               
1)	 It provides targeted step count goals to subjects based on their current walking.  Living well  and other public pedometer programs provide no goals.
2)	It provides specific educational content about walking with lung disease, what to do with medications, how to breathe etc.  None of this is provided by public pedometer programs.
3)	It provides motivational messages to improve self-efficacy.  None of this is provided by public pedometer programs.
4)	It provides a mechanism for subjects to report changes in medical problems and adverse events to us.  This is crucial for subject safety.  None of this is provided by public pedometer programs.
5)	It is designed specifically for people with chronic medical disease.  Public pedometer programs are used by healthy persons to manage weight or stress.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p><br />POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>

OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>The Program Assistant's principal responsibility is to assist one of OTI's regional teams in the management of existing country programs and participates in new country program assessments as the need arises.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Program Manager is a member of one of DCHA/OTI's Regional Teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, DC. OTI currently has four regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division (FPD): Afghanistan and Pakistan (AF/PAK), Asia and Middle East (AME), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC). OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>The Program Manager's principal responsibility is to assist one of OTI's regional teams in the management of existing country programs and participates in new country program assessments as the need arises. This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus approximately 80% of time on country program implementation, and approximately 20% of time on strategic planning and program development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to hire qualified personnel needed to assist and support OTI's regional teams with program implementation-related activities.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Program Manager requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Regional Team Leader or his/her designee (e.g. the Sr. Program Manager), the Program Manager will:</p>
<p>At the GS-11 level "Program Manager":</p>
<p>&bull; Respond to requests for information and tasks regarding OTI programs from within and outside the Agency in collaboration with OTI's Program Office;</p>
<p>&bull; Implement and manage assigned country program(s), including contractors and grantees working under country programs and provide support, when needed, as an auxiliary team member in the field, being prepared to travel to difficult posts in overseas conflict or post-conflict areas for up to one month or more if required;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide backstopping and troubleshooting support to field-based staff through frequent communication;</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare documentation for any required program contracts, grants or cooperative agreements;</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) for Task Orders with a contractor for Program Office services, ensuring OTI's requirements are met (serving as COTR requires the successful completion of a USAID training course within the first 6-12 months of employment);</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure completion of OTI project administration, budgeting and contracting action needs;</p>
<p>&bull; Manage and/or participate in the selection of program implementers, such as grantees, contractors, and personal services contractors;</p>

<p>&bull; Perform complex country analysis and program design to develop existing and future programs and strategies in high priority countries;</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in design and implementation of new country program operations to include management, logistical, budget, administrative, personnel and contractual issues;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, participate on inter-office, inter-bureau, or inter-agency committees where issues relate to OTI's program goals;</p>
<p>&bull; In limited circumstances, the incumbent may be required to provide assistance to organizations outside of OTI but within the current scope of work, where such assistance would enhance both OTI's goals and objectives as well as the incumbent's job skills;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting team leader or country or deputy country representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull; Mentor/train other OTI Program Assistants / Program Managers as required; and</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties and activities as required for the successful completion of country programs.</p>
<p>At the GS-12 level:</p>
<p>&bull; Perform the same duties as the GS-11 equivalent level but with less supervision, greater decision-making authority, and greater independence of action.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Program Manager will take direction from and will report to their respective OTI Regional Team Leader within the Field Programs Division or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p><br />L-514 CONTRACTOR PASSES<br />Procedures for contractors obtaining entry authority on Malmstrom AFB: Access for contractors entering Malmstrom AFB may be permitted providing the contractor follows the procedures set forth below and 341 SW Pamphlet 31-103 (available at Visitor Control Center) and meets the security standards including applicable background checks. Access for contractors entering Malmstrom AFB will be permitted to contractor personnel who obtain proper credentials and passes through one of the two main entry points (Commercial Gate on 2nd Ave North or 10th Ave North Gate). Retired military members and dependents of active duty or retired military members who are employed by your company may use their retired or dependent Armed Forces Identification Card to enter Malmstrom AFB; however, they must still obtain a contractor's pass through the Visitor's Center located outside of the Commercial gate. In the event of increased force protection conditions, retired military members and the dependents of active duty or retired military personnel without a contractor's pass, will be required to follow the security measures enacted under the respective force protection condition. Contractor's badges will be obtained in the following manner:<br />a. First, contractor employees must already have adequate identification such as a driver's license or company ID card. This identification should include, as a minimum, the physical description of the individual (i.e., height, weight, date of birth, eye and hair color), a picture of the individual, and the individual's signature.<br />b. Upon award of a contract, the contractor will be issued an Entry Authorization List (EAL) by the contract administrator in 341 CONS. The contractor will need to submit the required information for the EAL to the contract administrator in 341 CONS prior to contractor personnel coming to Malmstrom AFB.<br />c. Upon initial entrance to Malmstrom AFB, contractors' personnel shall obtain a contractor's pass from the Visitor's Center where the EAL will be filed. Contractor passes will be valid for the duration of the contract. The contractor will be required to resubmit a new EAL upon exercising option years, contract renewals or extensions, and adding or subtracting names to and from the EAL.<br />d. If contractors need access to Malmstrom AFB for time(s) outside of the performance period of the contract (i.e., administrative issues, warranty issues, site visits), they will need to be vouched on by the customer, or supporting agency, of the respective contract they are associated with.<br />e. At the time contractors initially come to the Visitor's Center to obtain their pass, they will be required to fill out DD Form 1172, which the Visitor's Center will issue and maintain.<br />f. It will be the sole responsibility of the contractor to renew, remove, and add employees to the EAL. In order to renew, remove or add names to the EAL the contractor must follow the same processes as if they were submitting the EAL for the first time.<br />g. For existing contracts that are already in progress, contractors will follow the procedures mentioned above if any person(s) need a new or updated pass.<br />h. Any other instances where contractors need access to Malmstrom AFB will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis in which the customer, or supporting agency, will need to sponsor contractor personnel entry and accompany them while on base.<br />i. All passes must be returned to 341 SFS (Visitor Center) upon completion of the contract, or personal no longer require access to the installation, under performance of this contract.<br />j. Vehicles owned by your firm will be permitted entry to Malmstrom AFB if they are conspicuously marked with your firm's name or logo, with the exception of magnetic signs, when you have contract requiring performance on the base. If your vehicles are not so marked, it will be necessary for you to obtain a temporary vehicle registration for each vehicle to be operated on Malmstrom AFB. This registration is accomplished by the contractor or designated representative at the Pass and Registration Section. Proof of ownership and a current valid driver's license are required for vehicle registration. You or your representative will be required to certify in writing that your firm carries insurance on your vehicle or vehicles as outlined below:</p>
<p>i. $10,000 Property Damage Liability.<br />ii. $25,000 Personal Liability for each person.<br />iii. $50,000 Personal Liability for each accident.</p>
<p>(Note :) Each vehicle must be insured for the above limits if not already covered in your contract.</p>
<p>WAWF INSTRUCTIONS<br />To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments.<br />To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.com. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.com is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. For your contract, the following data elements will be required to create and route your WAWF documents correctly:<br />-Contract and/or Delivery Order Number: <br />-CAGE Code: <br />-Issue Date: <br />-Issue By DoDAAC: <br />-Admin DoDAAC: <br />-Inspect By DoDAAC: <br />-Service Acceptor DODAAC: <br />-Ship To Code (DoDAAC or CAGE Code): <br />-Local Processing Office (LPO) DoDAAC*: <br />-Pay DoDAAC:</p>
<p>*LPO DoDAACs are used for Navy contracts only.</p>
<p>(xiv) DPAS Rating does not apply to this acquisition.</p>

<DESC>This is a modification to address all Q&A's.

Questions in response to Solicitation No. D10PS18675 (DCAA) for Statistician Services

Question 1:  We are envisioning a proposal wherein the requirements under the contract would be performed not by a PhD statistician alone, but rather by a PhD statistician working in concert with, and overseeing the efforts of, a highly skilled support team. This support team would be comprised of PhD labor economists, and perhaps also programmers, as appropriate to the given effort. Such a "team" approach could create significant efficiencies through the targeted use of resources most appropriate to a particular task.
We would like to know if such a "team" approach might be considered for this solicitation.
Question 2:  Can the contractor have more than one statistician with the specified qualifications perform the required work? 
Answer to both questions: We want to obtain a high degree of coordination on specific matters.  This is important so that the individual providing support services gains insight into how the Defense Contract Audit Agency operates.   There are very few individuals that have an understanding of the audit environment; and, thus, we believe it is far more efficient to only have one individual responsible for providing the support services under this contract.   Therefore, the answer to both questions is: No.   A team approach would not be acceptable.   And only one PhD is needed to provide the support services.

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Although advocates of green roofs point to numerous environmental, social and economic benefits, these have not been fully and critically documented and analyzed. In order to define the business case for green roofs and to expand their use in federal facilities, Congress required GSA to conduct a study to identify the benefits and challenges of green roofs.

It shall include examples of existing or planned GSA green roofs. It should analyze building life-cycle cost, return on investment, energy savings, historic preservation considerations, and factors such as the size of the roof, structural capability, building age, and what, if any, sustainable design features might be important to justify the costs associated with green roofs<span style="COLOR: red">. </span>(</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Helv','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Helv">HR: 110-920: 69 &amp; J.E.S.: 985).</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">Although advocates of green roofs point to numerous environmental, social and economic benefits, these have not been fully and critically documented and analyzed. In order to define the business case for green roofs and to expand their use in federal facilities, Congress required GSA to conduct a study to identify the benefits and challenges of green roofs.

It shall include examples of existing or planned GSA green roofs. It should analyze building life-cycle cost, return on investment, energy savings, historic preservation considerations, and factors such as the size of the roof, structural capability, building age, and what, if any, sustainable design features might be important to justify the costs associated with green roofs<span style="COLOR: red">. </span>(</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Helv','sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Helv">HR: 110-920: 69 &amp; J.E.S.: 985).</span></p>

<DESC>The Grantee for this Feasibility Study provided the following answers to questions posed with regards to the Terms of Reference in the Grant Agreement:
<p><br />1. The TOR says the job will require six to eight months. Our estimate is - it can take about nine months given the interaction necessary between the contractor and KESC management including the survey. Since the deadline for proposal submission is 30 September (Now October 07), and it may take up to two months to finalize the contract details, the 31 May 2011 deadline to submit the final report may not be realistic. We need to have nine months from the date of signing the contract to work on the project including preparation of the final report.</p>
<p>- (Im afraid we can't do anything about the deadlines anymore I think that we do have a significant amount of information already available with us and so the project should not take longer than the given time)</p>
<p>2. What sort of background information and what will be the extent of this made available to us, does KESC have including attempts to reduce non-technical losses and what were the results of such attempts in the past. Do they have any breakdown of non-technical losses, based on residential, commercial, industrial sectors and/or the demographics (rich or poor) under each customer type?</p>
<p>- (We have a significant amount of data already at hand and I am sure that we will be able to provide the consultants with any data they require, all information within KESC should be available since this is not usually a problem here)</p>
<p>3. We need further clarification for Task 1.2. This task requires a "Design" of a pilot project, not doing the project. But the design of the pilot will require data about cross-section of residential incomes, payment records, electricity demand and peak profiles, and small commercial accounts, etc. Does KESC have such information in a format such that the data can be handed over to the contractor at the start of the project? If not, how much time will it take for KESC to collect and process this information. According to the TOR, the cost of this work is a part of the KESC's cost share.</p>
<p>- (A significant portion of the data should be available, the form required however you would change depending on each consultant and therefore I can not say that this would be available on day one of the project)</p>
<p>4. In Task 1.3 it has been mentioned that, "It is understood that, this project, if implemented, would ultimately force people to pay electric bills that they have evaded paying for decades." Does KESC have any prior experience with this? In the past have KESC tried to make their customers pay in full for what electricity they are using? Has KESC thought about what they can provide their customers (in terms of better service, less outages, no load shedding, etc.) in return for them to pay their bills in full and on-time?</p>
<p>- (There are several initiatives which are already in place and pretty soon you will be hearing about other incentives that are being provided for customers who pay on time and areas which have low levels of line losses)</p>
<p>5. Task 2.2. Is KESC aware of GDP losses attributed to load shedding? Do they have, or have access to such information?</p>
<p>- (I don't believe that we have any particular data pertaining to the impact on the GDP)</p>
<p>6. Also in Task 2.2. It is stated that "...the decision made by individual customers to stop taking power or to start paying for that power may be influenced by the methods of public notice and customer service tactics employed by KESC". Does KESC have any documentation about their (KESC) past efforts in this area?</p>
<p>- (Once again we can provide information about past and ongoing drives for increasing revenue collection and bringing down the bad debts)</p>
<p>7. Task 3.1. Does KESC have any prior experience in getting private sector financing for any of their capital investments, or improvements in system operations?</p>
<p>- (We have several projects which run into the millions of dollars, we do not have access to public funds and therefore all projects under development are being worked on while keeping in mind the need to raise financing or capital investments from the private sector)</p>
<p>8. Does KESC have any prior experience with doing environmental impact assessment? And if so, did they do this in-house? Or used outside consultants? What was their experience with outside consultants?</p>
<p>- (We have successfully used third party consultants for EIA reports in the past for other projects)</p>
<p>9. Task 6. It is stated that, ".... Assess the development impacts associated with the implementation of the project and the methodology for measuring those benefits/adverse impacts." Has KESC done something like in the past? Will they share relevant reports with us?</p>
<p>- (This is the first project pertaining to smart grids and information from other projects may not always be available depending on the nature of the project)</p>
<p>10. Task 8.1. Need to get KESC's reaction about "..training or capacity building needed to ensure adequate skills are available within KESC's institution and its stakeholder counterparts such as National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), Pakistan Electric Power Company (PEPCO), local government, police and security forces, and others". Can KESC share any past experiences with us along these lines?</p>
<p>- (Training is an ongoing process for both technical and non technical staff (like any other organization) im not sure what you would like us to share over here, we have successfully trained our engineers for specific technical requirements on several occassions in the past)</p>
<p>11. Is KESC willing to provide any feedback on the draft final report before it is formally submitted to KESC and USTDA?</p>
<p>- (I would imagine that the feedback process would be done at each stage of the project, our team will be actively involved during the whole process in order to ensure that the work is in line with the requirements of KESC.)</p>

<DESC><p>This is an amendment to Request for Information (RFI), RFI-C21-CLS, issued on 22 Sep 2010, as part of market research. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. All responses to this amendment are requested by 1 Oct 2010.</p>
<p>Additional questions are added to RFI-C21-CLS as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Considering Scenario #1. In addition the Government may choose to reserve the right to make two separate awards. The first award may include full CLS support for 28 aircraft for a 1-year base with four 1-year option period contract. The second award may be for COMBS only support for 19 aircraft for approximately one year (FY13), which would include the probable drawdown of all aircraft mentioned in the third paragraph of the original RFI.<br /></strong><br />34) Would you be interested in the contract that would support the 28 aircraft with full CLS for five years? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>35) Would you be interested in the contract that would support the 19 aircraft with COMBS only for approximately one year? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>35) Would the possibility of two separate awards affect your proposal? If so, how? Would it affect pricing also?</p>

<SUBJECT>Request for Information - C-21 Contractor Logistics Support
<SOLNBR>RFI-C21-CLS
<RESPDATE>100110
<CONTACT>Samuel T. McDuffey, Contracting Officer, Phone 405-739-4448, Email samuel.mcduffey@tinker.af.mil
<DESC><p>The CLS Sustainment Division (formerly 727 ACSG). This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, as part of a market research. The CLS Sustainment Division is seeking to identify sources that may be capable of providing Site Maintenance to include depot support and aircraft modifications and Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) for approximately 47 C-21A aircraft. In addition, the Government is seeking industry input regarding the possible scenarios presented below. There is no solicitation package available at this time. All interested parties should send company and/or descriptive literature along with responses to the following questions and any comments or questions to Mr. Samuel McDuffey, e-mail: samuel.mcduffey@tinker.af.mil. All responses should be received no later than 3:00 PM CST, 1 October 2010. All questions and comments must be in writing, no telephone calls. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.</p>
<p>The government is looking at the possibility of awarding a Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contract to provide site maintenance, Contract Operated Maintained Base Supply (COMBS), Contract Field Team (CFT), and modification installation support for 47 aircraft at 10 different sites (8 CONUS, 1 OCONUS, 1 deployed). This breakout would include COMBS support only for 19 aircraft at 3 CONUS sites and full CLS maintenance for the remaining aircraft. The 3 CONUS sites have experienced higher parts consumption rates than anticipated. The government has limited usage data, but history is not a predictor of future events. The government does not own any spares or support equipment, therefore it would be the responsibility of the contractor to provide.</p>
<p>There is a possibility that a drawdown will take place which would remove the COMBS support only requirement for the 19 aircraft at 3 CONUS sites starting FY12, 4th Qtr. The reduction may include quarterly reductions in aircraft with one site closing at the end of FY13, 1st Qtr, and the two other sites closing at the end of FY13, 4th Qtr. There is no known probable reduction for the remaining 28 aircraft or closure of any other sites for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><strong>General Questions</strong><br />1) Do you currently provide Aircraft Maintenance and Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) to customers who operate small business jets?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) If so, how many locations, number of aircraft, and model aircraft do you support?</p>
<p>2) Has your company had experience (in the past 5 years) providing Aircraft Maintenance and COMBS to a fleet of business type jet aircraft in excess of 45 aircraft in multiple locations?</p>
<p>3) Has your company had experience (in the past 5 years) providing only COMBS support for military maintainers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Did you face any challenges?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) If so, what challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?</p>
<p>4) Has your company had experience (in the past 5 years) providing Aircraft Maintenance and COMBS outside of the continental United States and its territories? Where was that customer located?</p>
<p>5) Assuming the scope of work does not change, how long of a period of performance can you accurately project your costs?</p>
<p>6) How long is your typical contractual arrangement established with vendors and subcontractors?</p>
<p>7) Do you have the ability to perform engineering service capability on a commercial derivative Lear Jet 35A i.e. C-21A</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) What limitations of engineering support if any would you have?</p>
<p>8) What are your thoughts on this effort being a total small business set-aside?</p>
<p>9) The Government is contemplating a service contract, NAICS Code 488190, what category does your company fall within; small business, veteran-owned small business, small disadvantaged business, Certified 8A, Hub Zone small business, women-owned small business, large business?</p>
<p>10) What previous experience does your company have with Government contracts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Is your company familiar with the Government processes of contracting, billing, engineering, etc.?</p>
<p>11) If you had previous contracts with the Government, what types of pricing arrangement were used?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) What type of pricing arrangement would you recommend for the contract?</p>
<p>12) What does your company specialize in?</p>
<p><strong>In an effort to plan for a possible drawdown, the government has come up with several scenarios. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Scenario #1. The government anticipates the award of a 5-year contract (1-year base w/4 one year option periods) beginning on or about FY13, 1st Qtr. This scenario places the new contractor in a situation where they could possibly be required to stand up and shut down one CONUS site within the first few months of award and the other two CONUS sites within the first ten months of award. The three sites having 19 aircraft would require COMBS support only; keeping in mind the contractor would be required to purchase/lay-in of all spares and parts. Additionally upon award the contractor would be required to provide COMBS and Aircraft Maintenance to 4 other CONUS sites, 1 OCONUS, and 1 deployed site for 28 aircraft. The government will not provide support equipment, spares or parts.</strong></p>
<p>13) What challenges would the contractor face if required to stand up and shut down sites in this timeframe while maintaining the requirements for the stable fleet of 28 aircraft? Please include cost, schedule and other challenges that pertain to supply inventory, personnel hiring, support equipment, overhead management, etc. How would the contractor handle these challenges?</p>
<p>14) What other recommendations/approaches can you offer that would provide USAF insight that would result in successful Contractor Logistic Services COMBS effort for these 19 aircraft?</p>
<p>15) What are your recommendations and/or concerns with this scenario?</p>
<p>16) Are there any concerns regarding this period of performance?</p>
<p>17) Provide any other comments you have for this 5-year scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario #2. The government anticipates the award of a 5-year contract (1-year base w/4 one year option periods) beginning on or about 1 October 2012. For COMBS and Aircraft Maintenance for 28 aircraft at 4 CONUS, 1 OCONUS, and 1 deployed site. In this scenario, there is no expectation of aircraft drawdown. The government will not provide support equipment, spares or parts.</strong></p>
<p>18) What challenges would the contractor face with this scenario? Please include cost, schedule and others challenges that pertain to supply inventory, personnel hiring, support equipment, etc. How would the contractor handle these challenges?</p>
<p>19) What other recommendations/approaches can you offer that would provide USAF insight that would result in successful Contractor Logistic Services COMBS and Aircraft Maintenance effort for these aircraft?</p>
<p>20) What are your recommendations and/or concerns with this source selection?</p>
<p>21) Are there any concerns regarding this period of performance?</p>
<p>22) Provide any other comments you have for this 5-year scenario.</p>
<p>23) Do you foresee a significant savings between scenario 2 versus scenario 1? If so please explain and illustrate how the government could benefit from such savings, for example cost savings, program success, streamline processes etc.</p>
<p>24) In reference to the two previous options presented please provide an assessment to each for probable success using the following scale:</p>
<p>1= high probability not to succeed without relief of requirements to 10 being high a probability of success with little to no duress to the contractor or the government</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Scenario 1 High Risk 1-------------5------------10 Low Risk<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Scenario 2 High Risk 1-------------5------------10 Low Risk</p>
<p><strong>Scenario #3. The government anticipates the award of a 2-year bridge contract (1-year base w/4 quarterly option periods) beginning approximately 1 October 2011. This scenario places the contractor in a situation where they would be required to provide short term COMBS support (10 months to 2 years) at the 3 closing sites for 19 aircraft and simultaneously maintain Aircraft Maintenance and COMBS support for 28 aircraft located at 4 additional CONUS sites, 1 OCONUS, and 1 deployed site. The government will not provide support equipment, spares or parts.</strong></p>
<p>25) What challenges would the contractor face if required to stand up and shut down sites in this timeframe, (2 years or less)? Please include cost, schedule and others challenges that pertain to supply inventory, personnel hiring, support equipment, etc. How would the contractor handle these challenges?</p>
<p>26) Do you foresee your organization desiring to participate in such an endeavor as this 2-year scenario? If so what challenges does this short term contract present for the contractor? Please include cost, schedule and other challenges that would pertain to this scenario.</p>
<p>27) Do you foresee being able to economically amortize your capital investment of this scenario over the 2-year period or should the government expect an above normal cost due to the contract term and activity? Please provide a detailed explanation of your response.</p>
<p>28) What other recommendations /approaches can you offer that would provide USAF insight that would result in successful Contractor Logistic Services COMBS and Aircraft Maintenance effort for these aircraft?</p>
<p>29) What are your recommendations and/or concerns with this source selection?</p>
<p>30) Are there any concerns regarding this period of performance?</p>
<p>31) Provide any other comments you have for the 2-year scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Questions<br /><br /></strong>32) What advantages/disadvantages do you perceive for using a FAR Part 12, firm-fixed priced contract?</p>
<p>33) Provide any other commercial suggestions or approaches to fulfilling this requirement.</p>
<p>This is an amendment to Request for Information (RFI), RFI-C21-CLS, issued on 22 Sep 2010, as part of market research. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government. All responses to this amendment are requested by 1 Oct 2010.</p>
<p>Additional questions are added to RFI-C21-CLS as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Considering Scenario #1. In addition the Government may choose to reserve the right to make two separate awards. The first award may include full CLS support for 28 aircraft for a 1-year base with four 1-year option period contract. The second award may be for COMBS only support for 19 aircraft for approximately one year (FY13), which would include the probable drawdown of all aircraft mentioned in the third paragraph of the original RFI.<br /></strong><br />34) Would you be interested in the contract that would support the 28 aircraft with full CLS for five years? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>35) Would you be interested in the contract that would support the 19 aircraft with COMBS only for approximately one year? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>36) Would the possibility of two separate awards affect your proposal? If so, how? Would it affect pricing also?</p>

HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day.	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>All inquiries concerning this announcement must be directed to Glenn Wilson, Contracting Officer, via email at glenn.a.wilson@faa.gov or at (202) 385-7730.
This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) regarding the Meteorological and Aeronautical Planning System (MAPS) program.  The responses to this market survey will be used for information purposes only.  
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR OFFER. THIS IS NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR).  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
INTRODUCTIONThis RFI is an announcement regarding the Meteorological and Aeronautical Planning System (MAPS) Program. The purpose of this RFI is to post a summary table of the MAPS' Preliminary Shortfall Analysis Report and elicit specific information regarding potential solutions that will address the required MAPS enhancements.Flight Services are currently provided by four separate contract vehicles. Preflight assistance and Inflight Advisory services in Alaska are provided by government employees using a leased automation system called the Operational and Supportability Implementation System (OASIS).  Preflight and Inflight support for the Continental United States (CONUS), Hawaii and Puerto Rico are currently provided by contract labor using a vendor-owned automation system called Flight Services through the 21st Century (FS21).  Additionally, there are two internet pilot web portals which enable pilots to self-brief and file/amend flight plans.  These systems are known as Direct User Access Terminal Services (DUAT/S. The term DUAT-Replacement (DUAT-R) is used to refer to the current contracts. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined that the best interest of the government and the aviation community would be served by integrating Alaska and CONUS requirements into a single platform to be deployed NAS-wide and the acquisition of this new platform will be best served by conducting a full and open competition.  
This RFI addresses the Flight Service automation requirements, along with the internet capabilities. The first contract delivery release would be deployed in the 2014-2015 timeframe.   
The FAA is especially interested in increased communications capabilities, internet and SWIM compliant systems with shared database technology based on industry experience with previously developed air traffic and flight service automation and voice systems. The FAA seeks to understand current and proposed industry capabilities to meet the requirements, the ability to meet the proposed deployment schedule including the acquisition strategy, and any suggestions that would further enhance safety and service delivery. The FAA also solicits recommendations or opinions as to the CONUS operational labor component and how best to structure the contract or contracts to meet the need for contract operational support in the CONUS. 
At this time, the FAA is not prepared to address service delivery locations.  This information will be provided in later Market Surveys or Screening Information Requests (SIRs).
Based upon the findings of this RFI, the FAA plans to release either a draft SIR for Industry comment or a formal SIR for Industry response or conduct an Industry Day. 
Proposed MAPS ENHANCEMENTS The impact of the service enhancements envisioned for MAPS will be a decrease in the number of general aviation (GA) aircraft accidents.  There is a direct correlation between a general aviation pilot not receiving a preflight weather briefing and/or en route updates and the occurrence of a weather-related aircraft accident.  In addition, this system will enhance post accident survivability by reducing search area and promoting a faster response by emergency services personnel. Currently both initial contact and subsequent contact depend on the pilot initiating the call to the FSS.  If the pilot does not call, important information pertinent to flight safety may not reach them.  This antiquated, customer contact-dependent "pull" model continues today.  As a result, pilots often do not receive safety-related information because they either do not or can not call Flight Service, or they call too late for the information to be of benefit. The MAPS solution is to augment the "pull" model by adding a "push" component, i.e., automatic update capability, to the system.  While pilots would continue to initiate services, automation would "push" critical updates to the pilot in time for them to make rational, safety-related decisions about their flight.  These automatic updates would be provided at no-cost to the pilot.  The system would only send advisory information pertinent to the route of flight, before or during its operation, and would eliminate redundant information.  This system would be built around an integrated global database network to provide NAS-consistent information, relative to current aircraft position, and accessible through Internet connectivity.  Direct contact with Flight Service Specialists will be provided when the system will not accept a specific flight plan or when the pilot requires clarification or technical assistance in preflight planning and filing.  Preflight support will remain available via phone, radio or by the new 'Internet text chat' function.  Flight planning issues will be resolved quickly because the same source information will be seen by both pilot and Specialist, i.e, an integrated, interactive pilot web portal.
As currently envisioned by the FAA, MAPS services will be net-centric, and therefore widely available and with more current data. Not all enhancements are addressed in this document but several significant capabilities should illustrate the anticipated safety benefits of the new system. For example, a pilot could receive a text and/or graphics-based weather brief in the cockpit while warming up their engine on the ramp rather than relying on an hours-old brief obtained before departure. Also many pilots are reluctant to file Visual Flight Rules (VFR) flight plans out of concern that they may forget to close a flight plan and trigger a SAR false alarm.  Since MAPS will include an automatic reminder to close fight plans in addition to other enhancements, it is anticipated that a substantial increase in the number of pilots who file flight plans, receive weather briefings and fly will benefit from the increased situational awareness afforded by MAPS.
The web-based flight planning system, including an identical interface for pilot and Specialist, will ensure a shared situational awareness of the flight and the conditions expected to be encountered for the planned route.  MAPS will also provide applicable airspace restrictions and traffic management information.  Pilots will be able to enter their personal level of risk tolerance for a specific flight, e.g., highest acceptable intensity of turbulence, lowest layer of cloud cover and/or lowest visibility desired, probability of encounter, etc. This decision support tool will enable general aviation pilots and Flight Service Specialists to more accurately determine the impact of weather hazards upon their flight. Shared situational awareness and the integration of weather into decision support tools are key capabilities in the NextGen Concept of Operations.
Frequently-used flight plans, pilot contact  information, pilot preferences and aircraft capabilities will be stored in the MAPS system and may be used to auto populate flight plans.  After specifying the route of flight, aviation weather and aeronautical information will be accessed and provided in a standardized format from the FAA's authoritative sources.  Pilots will also be able to self-brief and/or download meteorological information as part of the flight plan briefing function.  Graphical, textual, and grid formats will be available.  Once the preflight briefing is complete, the pilot can subscribe to receive automatic information updates that occur after flight plan filing or post briefing, including items such as destination airport and alternate airport closures, new advisories for icing, turbulence, thunderstorms, etc.Once the flight plan has been filed in the system, critical changes to current or forecast meteorological and aeronautical information, e.g., urgent PIREPs, a new Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET), destination and alternate airport changes to/from IFR, TFRs, etc., will be sent automatically to pilots who subscribe to this free service and the condition impacts their planned flight.  These weather deltas will be provided as alerts to the pilot in a format chosen by the end-user. PIREP entry will be simplified, standardized in form, and easily accessed through voice-to-text capability.
Likewise, any critical aeronautical advisory changes in the NAS impacting the route of flight will also be generated automatically and forwarded to the pilot.  These deltas would include new or updated NOTAMs, destination and alternate airport closure, and TFRs that are applicable to the route of flight. Voice-to-text and text-to-voice capability will be available to minimize head down time for the pilot and increase situational awareness.  
Limiting Inflight communications to critical changes in aeronautical and meteorological information will reduce frequency congestion and alleviate the potential repetition of information that a pilot has previously received.  The automation system will also alert the Specialist if an automatic update cannot be sent or if it is rejected as undeliverable. Details of the active or passive acknowledgement processes will be determined after market survey during final requirements development.  
Pilots will be alerted to deviations from the filed flight plan and prompted to either return to the filed route of flight or amend the plan remotely.  This will reduce the number of deviation alerts sent to the Specialist and greatly reduce search and rescue response times.
The system will create a repository of information on VFR flight operations and track the flight planning services provided to those flights.  This transaction tracking capability will also automate the current En Route Flight Advisory Service (EFAS), enhance situational awareness for the support of SAR, and alleviate the necessity of re-transmitting information that has already been received by the pilot.  The system will maintain an accessible log all transactions.
Pilots may request flight plan monitoring. The system would then perform conformance monitoring and generate an alert to the pilot and the Specialist when an aircraft is out of conformance with its flight plan, allowing the pilot to amend the flight plan or return to the original route of flight. The intent is not to develop a separate flight plan tracker, but rather to request Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) information on VFR flights relative to their intended route of flight, using existing interfaces with En Route and Terminal automation.  
When the Specialist has a Radio Contact, he/she will enter the aircraft's Call Sign into MAPS and the system will identify any missing information required for a given flight. MAPS will allow any Specialist to see all information relevant to the flight and the information already provided to the pilot in a distinct format.   A logical outgrowth of the flight plan monitoring capability would be to expedite SAR operations using ADS-B location information. Initiating a SAR operation based on improved location data from aircraft (that are equipped with ADS-B and monitored by MAPS automation) will enable SAR operations to target search areas quickly and efficiently and thus greatly increase the probability of detection.  The search area will be greatly reduced which in turn will allow the search to be concentrated over a smaller area increasing the chances of finding a downed aircraft and improve post-accident survival rates.

<DESC>We are planning to combine the Installation Support Services (ISS) requirements for Wake Island and King Salmon divert location with Eareckson Air Station, Shemya, AK. We are looking for comments from industry concerning the plan. <br />1. What benefits will be derived from consolidating the requirements? Will there be any cost savings, economies of scale gained, quality improvements, better terms and conditions, etc....? Quantify if possible.<br />2. What are the draw-backs of consolidating the requirements? Will any potential negative impacts substantially exceed the benefits of combining all three locations into one requirement? Quantify if possible.<br />3. What benefits will be derived from a 7-year period of performance vice a 5-year period of performance?<br />4. What impact will the combination of all three locations into one requirement have on small business?<br />5. Is it feasible to expect one contractor to provide effective stewardship of these three locations geographically separated by such great distances? If the answer is yes, is it possible to identify the elimination of redundancies and waste?<br />6. What challenges do you see in the short term and what benefits do you see in the long term?<br />7. What are the communication and management challenges and/or benefits of geographically separated teams?<br />8. Request responses by COB 4 Oct 2010.

<p>The maximum contract value for all six (6) task order contracts is the total not-to-exceed ceiling amount of $15,000,000 for the base year and four (4) one-year option periods, which equates to $3,000,000.00 each year.</p>
<p>All six (6) contract holders will have a total not-to-exceed ceiling value of $3,000,000 per year. However, the total amount of work the Government expects to issue in a year will not exceed the ceiling amount of $3,000,000.00 inclusive of all six (6) task order contracts. The Government has no way of determining how many task orders any given contractor will receive in a year, therefore, the total not-to-exceed amount on each contract is the same as the Government's total not-to-exceed funding amount.</p>

<AWARDEE>SARGENT ENGINEERS, INC, 320 Ronlee Lane NW, Olympia, WA 98502 US
<DESC>Award was made to Sargent Engineers as indicated above.&nbsp; For additional information regarding this award contact Kris Bellini at <a href="mailto:kbellini@fs.fed.us">kbellini@fs.fed.us</a> or telephone: 509-684-7113.<br /><br /><br />Previously advertised on June 30, 2010: <br /><br />GOLD CREEK BRIDGE DESIGNS
<p>The Forest Service is seeking the design and contract development services of an engineering firm for two bridge designs located in Washington on the Okanogan &amp; Wenatchee National Forests. The projects are being designed in conjunction with the Interstate 90 Wildlife Corridor project, a multi-agency project being designed and implemented in several phases. The two projects sites are located on National Forest System Road, 4832 which runs adjacent to Interstate 90 as it crosses Gold Creek, near Snoqualmie Pass, Washington.</p>
<p>Work may include subsurface investigation/drilling at the site, preliminary bridge design development for two bridge structures, final structure design and drafting, roadway design and drafting, development of an engineering cost estimate, and the development of special contract requirements to support unique bridge construction. The design is in accordance with AASHTO LRFD, 4th Edition, and the construction would utilize the "Standard Specifications for Construction of Roads and Bridges on Federal Highway Projects (FP-03)." Electronic drafting of the plans would require Autocad Civil 3D 2010.</p>
<p>Work is required to be performed and certified by a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Washington. One structure is anticipated to exceed 200 feet in length. That structure will also require a certified stamp of a registered Structural Engineer in the State of Washington.</p>
<p>Specialized studies, some subsurface drilling, hydrology and hydraulics reports, Washington DOT (WSDOT) designs, and other data, have been accomplished in conjunction with WSDOT's projects and will be made available as part of the scoping for the Forest Service bridge design.</p>
<p>The Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program applies (FAR Subpart 19.10). This procurement is unrestricted regarding business size related to the primary North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) group 541330, which has a size standard of $4.5 million in average annual receipts.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK -</p>
<p>Gold Creek Bridge<br />Site will require a multi-span structure crossing the flood plain for Gold Creek, with a preliminary length determination of 660 feet utilizing multiple spans. The design should consider the use of WSDOT standard superstructure drawings for precast prestressed girders with a cast-in-place deck and should utilize as many repetitive details as possible to optimize design costs. The foundations are assumed to require driven piles or drilled shafts, possibly varying between the abutments and piers.</p>
<p>Gold Creek Wildlife Crossing<br />Site will require a single-span structure with a preliminary length of 125 feet. The design should consider the use of WSDOT standard superstructure drawings for precast prestressed girders as an entirely precast prestressed structure or a structure with a cast-in-place deck. The design should utilize as many repetitive details as possible to optimize design costs. The foundations are assumed to require driven piles or drilled shafts.</p>
<p>The need for and extent of subsurface investigation work will be determined after review and scoping of all existing subsurface information obtained through WSDOT and other activities in the vicinity of these crossings.</p>
<p>WSDOT structures have architectural requirements for structures on Interstate 90; these requirements are not required on the Forest Service project, unless they can be incorporated at minimal cost to the project. Project funding for construction is limited and will be capped at $5 million for the construction of both structures.</p>
<p>Recommendations for design criteria can be proposed as part of the preliminary design packages, but the emphasis of the designs is on the most cost-effective and least cost structures for this site that can meet the minimum project criteria. Familiarity with other bridge design work and bridge drafting standards for the Pacific Northwest Regional Office of the Forest Service is beneficial. Experience developing contract packages that utilize "Standard Specifications for Construction of Roads and Bridges on Federal Highway Projects (FP-03) is also preferred, but not required.</p>

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-5, 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5)


1.	The VA Long Beach Network 22 Logistics Office, 5901 East Seventh Street, Long Beach, California, intents to enter into a Contract that will require justification for other than full and open competition.

2.	This is a request for approval to issue a Sole Source contract to a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) under the provisions of Public Law 109-461.

3.	Contractor shall furnish all architect/engineering services, management, supervision, labor, transportation, equipments, materials and prepare site for building operations, including demolition and removal of existing structures for project entitled, "B140 Demolish-Remove Underground Storage Tank" as required by drawings and specifications. The estimated value of this contract is $446,881.33.

4.	The contract shall be issued under the authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(5) permitting other than full and open competition, and per FAR Subpart 6.3, paragraph 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute. In accordance with FAR 6.302 "Circumstances Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition" this statutory authority is cited as justification to award a sole source Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business contract valued more than $25,000 (simplified acquisition threshold) and less than $5,000,000 (authority ceiling limit). 

5.	This action requires the use of the cited authority in meeting the socio-economic goals established for the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The proposed contractor (Sand Dollar Construction) meets the statutory criteria, and is registered and listed in the VetBiz registry as a SDVOSB contractor.

6.	Competition was not sought for this acquisition. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8127(b), a sole-source set-aside is authorized for acquisitions for an amount more than the Simplified Acquisition Threshold but not exceeding $5,000,000.

7.	The anticipated cost is fair and reasonable to the government based on using service estimate.

8.	In an effort to support VA's socio-economic goals, the undersigned conducted market surveys (via both VetBiz.com and the Central Contractor Registration web sites) for qualified SDVOSB enterprises. The contracting officer has validated that the contractor is registered and certified in the VA VetBiz.gov database and qualifies as "small" in accordance with federal small business size standards for the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to the procurement.  All actions considered, no further effort was made to seek additional sources.

9.	The subject project was awarded in accordance with VAAR 819.7007 Sole source awards to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.

10.	Not applicable per line #2 above.

11.	Not applicable per line #2 above.



Procuring Contracting Officer Certification: I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

The Base Period is for eighteen (18) months, with three successive one (1) year options and one (1) six (6) month option in the following amounts: Base Period $12,251,131 (ARRA FUNDING), Option Period 1 $7,574,995; Option Period 2 $7,337,839; Option Period 3 $6,967,998; and Option Period Four $3,389,444. The total dollar value of this contract, including all options if exercised, is $37,521,407.<br /><br />The specific purpose of this project is to establish two (2) Biospecimen Core Resource(s) (BCRs) sites for receiving tissue and data from the multiple the Tissue Source Site (TSS) networks for storage, quality control, processing into molecular analytes, shipping of high quality analytes to genome characterization and sequencing centers, and other support efforts to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Program.</p>
<p>Rationale for other than fixed-price contracting action is as follows:</p>
<p>The nature of the project requirements described in the Statement of Work (SOW) do not contain precise specifications to warrant a fixed-price mechanism. Further, difficulty in estimating costs with accuracy does not lend this requirement to a fixed-price mechanism. Therefore, a cost reimbursement type contract is appropriate for this acquisition. In accordance with FAR 16.3, Cost-reimbursement contracts are suitable for use only when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract. Sufficient safeguards are included in the contract to ensure that costs are allowable, allocable, fair, and reasonable.</p>

Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 2009, this study plans to expand to 500 twin pregnancies, to recruit sufficient minorities for better population representation and to conduct a serial nutrition survey in all pregnancies.  We will also recruit 200-250 monochorionic and 250-300 dichorionic twin pregnancies.  A primary responsibility of the new clinical sites is to recruit both singleton (particularly minorities) and twin pregnancies in the first trimester and to follow up them until delivery.  The Contractor will screen, consent, recruit and follow up with at least 200 healthy, low risk pregnant women with a singleton gestation, at least 75 obese women in first trimester and at least 20 monochorionic and 20 dichorionic twin pregnancies.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is soliciting HUBZone contractors to install steel sheet piling along 85 feet of riverbank to provide protection to the manhole and portion of the sewer line closest to the slope. The project location is in the town of Agawam, Massachusetts. The erosion site is located along the right bank of the Westfield River in the vicinity of Main Street.<BR><BR>The sheeting will have a top elevation of 74.5 National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) and a bottom elevation of 44.5 feet NGVD. Sheeting will be driven by a vibratory hammer to a level approximately 7 feet above the 100-year flood elevation of 60.8 feet NGVD to protect the sewer line. Construction equipment will avoid impacting six large white ash (Fraxinus americana) trees located at the top of the bank. Once the sheeting is installed, the affected area will be top soiled and seeded and a biodegradable turf reinforcement membrane will be placed on the seeded final surface and staked into the ground, to protect against surface erosion while the vegetation becomes established. Fencing at the top of the slope will be installed for safety. <BR><BR>This solicitation will be available on or about 27 July 2010 and will be available for downloading by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov). In order to view this solicitation, prospective contractors are required to self register their firm with Federal Business Opportunities (Go to http://www.fbo.gov and register now under Vendor/Citizens). Amendments, if any, to this solicitation will be made available at the https://www.fbo.gov Internet site. Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests will be accepted. Registrants are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the registration list. This procurement is set aside for HUBZone firms. The applicable NAICS code is 237990 with a Small Business Size Standard of $33,500,000. All responsible sources may submit a bid, which will be considered by the New England District.<BR>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
VA-69D-10-RQ-0589
As Required By FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source

1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 	5000 W National Avenue Bldg 5, Milwaukee WI  53295

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the purchase of a bed tracking system including software and use of a software license.  Procurement will proceed on a sole source basis with Tele-Tracking Technologies.

3.	A description of supplies/services required:  Jesse Brown VAMC has a requirement for the lease of bed tracking software for use in reducing the length of time dirty beds sit idle. The software shall include but not be limited to use of license, upgrades, implementation and on-site training. Software/System will include Tele-Tracking Bed Management Suite (tm), one HL7 inbound, and one-way ADT interface client provided server. Software must be compatible with the VA existing NEC 2400 IMX R11 telephone system and the VA existing Window NT or Window NT 2003 operating system. Software must have the capability to page housekeeping staff (via existing telephone system) and to automatically notify staff of bed status without manually entering information into a computer.  The software is estimated to cost approximately $47,250.00 for the remainder of this fiscal year.  

4.	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source.  (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)).

5.	Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications:  Based upon information received from the end-user, Tele-Tracking's bed tracking software is the only product that is compatible with VA existing Window NT or Window NT 2003 operating system and the existing VA telephone system. This software has the unique ability to page housekeeping staff and to automatically notify them of dirty beds without manually entering information into a computer.  An interactive paging system will allow the housekeeping staff to page the VA's bed control unit to inform them of the status of discharge patient rooms. The software/system can also be upgraded and includes implementation & post training, ongoing software maintenance, application and service, etc. The software requested includes a centralized data system, which provides for multiple productivity reports to help refine bed turnover and patient placement processes. The intelligent Interactive Voice Response (iIVR) becomes the primary communications method at the facility for this purpose and requires no changes to the network infrastructure.  Detailed reports generated by this system are critical for the management of beds required for patient care.

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  A search for service-disabled veteran owned small businesses, veteran owned small businesses and small businesses capable of providing this software was completed in VetBiz and in the CCR Database using the Dynamic Small Business Search.  Results were negative when searching under the keywords "bed tracking."  An intent to sole source will be posted to FedBizOpps.  If any contractor/vendor believes they can meet the VA's requirements and are able to provide clear and convincing evidence of the above within the time period specified, they will be taken into consideration.  


7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  Price was confirmed with COTR on past purchases for the same or similar type equipment and is comparable.  Reference: V69D-P-0579, Tele-Tracking contract.

8.	Market survey conducted:  CCR Dynamic Small Business and VetBiz Searches were conducted 

9.	Other facts:  None

10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  None

11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  None

12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

VISN 22 NETWORK CONTRACTING ACTIVITY
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity Identification:  The Department of Veterans Affairs VISN 22 Network Contracting Activity has a requirement for a mouse telemetry system for VA San Diego Healthcare System as described in transaction number 664-10-4-143-1633.

2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved:  To procure equipment from Data Sciences International (DSI) on a sole source basis.

3. Description of Supplies or Services to Meet Agency Needs:  The DSI telemetry system for mouse is an eight (8) animal system configuration that records data from 8 animals simultaneously.  The mice are implanted with DSI's implantable transmitters used to measure blood pressure and ECG.  The system configuration includes: (8) PA-C10 mouse BP transmitters (used to measure blood pressure), (8) ETA-F10 mouse ECG transmitters (used to measure ECG), (8) RPC-1 receivers, (1) APR Ambient Pressure Reference, (2) Data Exchange Matrix with power supply, Dataquest A.R.T. Gold acquisition interface, and starter kits and surgical videos.

4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  Contracting without providing for full and open competition is authorized by Citation 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), and by FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

5.  Demonstration of the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: Data Sciences International does not use resellers or distributors in the United States and is a sole source provider of the PA-C10 and ETA-F10 implantable transmitters and the complete Physio Tel line of transmitters.  In addition, the Dataquest A.R.T. acquisition interface developed by DSI is designed for use with DSI transmitters and is not produced or sold by any other company.  

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized:  This requirement will be advertised as an intent to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 6.302, as required by FAR 5.203 

7. Determination Anticipated Cost Will Be Fair and Reasonable:  DSI's standard price for this system is $78,215.00.  DSI is offering it to the VA at the discounted price of $60,980.00, which is deemed fair and reasonable.

8. Description and Results of Market Research or Statement why Market Research Was Not Conducted:   A search of the GSA e-library using the keywords "mouse telemetry system" and "mouse telemetry" produced no results.  A search of the SBA website using keywords "telemetry" and NAICS code 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing produced one (1) result - UFI Inc.  Per an e-mail from UFI Inc., they sell telemetry systems that are for human use only.  A Google search produced one result - Millar Instruments, Inc.  When contacted, the person that answered the phone, Blain, stated that the current system that they have now is for larger rats.  They won't have a mouse system available until the first of the year.
	
9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:  Other than the fact that I've utilized every source that I can think of to find competition, the only fact to support the use of procuring this equipment via sole source is that this equipment will be paramount to Dr. Sushil Mahata, Research Physiologist at VA San Diego, for his research studies.

10. List Any Other Sources That Expressed Interest in Writing?  No sources have expressed an interest, in writing, in this acquisition.  However, an FBO announcement announcing our intent to negotiate a sole source procurement will be publicized.

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: 

12. I hereby certify that the above is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

VISN 22 NETWORK CONTRACTING ACTIVITY
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity Identification:  The Department of Veterans Affairs VISN 22 Network Contracting Activity has a requirement for gene targeting services for custom conditional targeting for 5033414D02Rik Transmembrane protein C9orf46 homolog for VA San Diego Healthcare System as described in transaction number 664-10-3-143-1303.

2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved:  To procure services from inGenious Targeting Laboratory, Inc. on a sole source basis.

3. Description of Supplies or Services to Meet Agency Needs:  (1) Cloning and construction of targeting vector for hybrid 129S6/SvEvTac/C57BL/6 cell line, including analysis of gene structure, screening strategy design, probe design, isolation and confirmation of genomic BAC clone, targeting vector construction including insertion and confirmation of homology arms, flanking of the genomic targeting region by Lox-P sites for Cre-excision, insertion and confirmation of Neomycin selection cassette flanked by FRT sites for positive selection, and preparation of DNA for electroporation. (2) Electroporation of hybrid 129S6/SvEvTac/C57BL/6 ES cells with targeting vector and tissue culture work to isolate antibiotic-resistant clones, and (3) Screening of ES cell clones to identify positives, including preparation of DNA from individual ES clones and confirmation of targeting events by PCR and Southern Blotting.

4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  Contracting without providing for full and open competition is authorized by Citation 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), and by FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

5.  Demonstration of the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: The inGenious Targeting Laboratory is the only vendor that offers all of the above specific services required.  In addition, the inGenious Targeting Laboratory developed the Hybrid ES cell technology, creating a new line (129S6/SVEvTac strain with the C57BL/6 line) and is the only vendor to offer electroporation into this line.  Dr. Parmer's research project already has been collecting data involving this Hybrid (129S6/SvEvTac/C57BL/6) cell line.  Thus, it is essential that the Research department continue using this specific cell line in order to be able to interpret the new information in conjunction with their previous and ongoing data collection.  In addition, use of this hybrid cell line dramatically increases efficiency of homologous recombination when compared to other cell lines.  Also, inGenious Targeting Laboratory guarantees a result or they don't charge a fee.

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized:  This requirement will be advertised as an intent to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 6.302, as required by FAR 5.203 

7. Determination Anticipated Cost Will Be Fair and Reasonable:  Prices, when compared to Jefferson Kimmel Cancer Center for similar, but not exact services, are within a comparable range for these commercial services.  Per Dr. Parmer, who has worked with several different laboratories, has stated that the prices are competitive and fair.     

8. Description and Results of Market Research or Statement why Market Research Was Not Conducted:   A search of the GSA e-library produced no results.  A search of the CCR using NAICS code 541711 - Research and Development in Biotechnology and the keywords, "gene targeting" produced no results.  A Google search produced several sources, but after reading several individual company profiles, 3 sources seemed the most likely to have the capabilities to provide the required services.  They are as follows: (1) University of California Irvine (UCI), (2) Jefferson Kimmel Cancer Center, and (3) University of Pennsylvania.  Due to the complexity of the technical information that is provided in Dr. Parmer's 2237, the Contracting Officer requested that Dr. Parmer contact the 3 sources and talk to one of their scientists to see if they could provide the same technical services that Dr. Parmer needs to continue his ongoing research. Dr. Parmer contacted Mr. Tom Fielder at UCI (949) 824-6496, Mr. Carlisle Landel, Ph.D. at the Jefferson Kimmel Cancer Center (215) 503-4539, and another person (Dr. Parmer forgot the person's name) at the University of Pennsylvania, Penn Medicine (215) 573-9327.  Dr. Parmer's findings are as follows:  None of the 3 vendors were able to provide the exact services required.  Cloning and construction of the targeting vector, as outlined in item #3(1) above, is not provided.  In addition, none of the facilities uses the specific Hybrid (129S6/SvEvTac/C57BL/6) ES cell line required.  Also, the required screening services as outlined in item #3(3) above, is not provided.  Finally, none of the 3 vendors guarantee a result.
	
9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:  Although there are companies available that do like services, the VA Research Investigator, Dr. Parmer has already been collecting data involving this new Hybrid cell line.  If a different cell line is used at this stage of the research, it would not be able to be properly or accurately interpreted in conjunction with his previous and ongoing data collection.  This would jeopardize the validity of Dr. Parmer's study.

10. List Any Other Sources That Expressed Interest in Writing?  No sources have expressed an interest, in writing, in this acquisition.  However, an FBO announcement announcing our intent to negotiate a sole source procurement will be publicized.

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: 

12. I hereby certify that the above is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>
1.  Agency and Contracting Activity Identification: The Department of Veterans Affairs Network VISN 22 Contracting Activity (NCA), 5901 East Seventh Street, Long Beach, CA 90822, has received a requirement to purchase Motorized Patient Transport Solutions in the form of Motorized Stretchers for the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. 

2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved:  Negotiation shall be conducted to procure these Motorized Patient Transport Solutions from Alliant healthcare.  Circumstances require that this be done without the benefit of full and open competition.  This shall be conducted as a one-time purchase contract through other than full and open market procedures.  Cost: $548,978.24.

3. Description of Requirement:  VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System requires 32 Patient Transport Solutions which have the following capabilities: 700lb weight capacity, wide patient surface, <23" in height, scale system, side rails with release, foot end nursing controls, transfer boards, integrated pump rack, IV pole, powered back rest, and litter mounted oxygen bottle holder.    
 
4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:  This request is pursuant to the authority of FAR Part 6.302-5 and Public Law 109-461 Sec 502 as codified in  U.S.C  8127(b).

5.  The Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited:
A. FAR Part 6.302-5 allows for the procurement of items through other than full and open competition; when a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made through another agency or from a specified source, or the agency's need is for a brand name commercial for authorized resale.  Public Law 109-461 expressly authorizes the use of sole source awards to Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses if 1) such concern is determined to be a responsible source with respect to performance of such contract opportunity; 2) anticipated award with option is under $5,000,000 and 3) in the estimation of the contracting officer, the contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers the best value to the United States.
B. This acquisition for thirty-two Patient Transport Solutions is being acquired from Alliant Healthcare Inc.  This company has passed all past performance checks and has had a positive history of successful transactions with this VISN.  In addition, this contractor has provided this same item to this VISN in the past for a price higher than what is currently being offered due to economic conditions.  This item when compared to other purchases made and heavily modified items that could possibly meet these requirements is cheaper and more effective for use within this VISN.  Finally this award falls under $5,000,000.  Thus under public law 109-461 and FAR Part 6.302-5, we shall sole this procurement to Alliant Healthcare, an SDVOSB contractor as certified by Vetbiz.gov.

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.  A Notice of intent has been publicized and synopsized under requirements stated in FAR Part 5.  A notice of award shall be posted after award is made.

7. Anticipated Cost: The anticipated cost of this procurement presented by Alliant Healthcare Inc is fair and reasonable to the Government based on using service estimates and previous purchasing history of prices.  In addition, negotiation has been utilized to bring the price down by an additional 4%.

8. Results of Market Survey: In accordance with FAR Part 10 Market Research, various VA and Federal Supply Schedules were thoroughly reviewed.  It was found that Alliant was the only company that could provide a solution that could meet our needs with a reasonable price.

9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None.  See Items 5 above.

10. Any Other Interested Sources? There are no other sources that have expressed an interest to date.  


11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take To Remove of Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required: As this is an SDVOSB Sole Source Procurement, removing barriers to competition for any subsequent actions would require that all goals of public law 109-461 be thoroughly met.  Once these goals have been met as deemed by Congress, full and open market procurement of these items shall be attempted, though these items are rather unique due to the special features that these solutions have.


12. I hereby certify that the above is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>1. Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Service Area Office (SAO) East, Network Contracting Activity 8, Acquisition Service Center 4, Construction Team 3, VA Caribbean Healthcare System, San Juan, Puerto Rico.

2. Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of construction services required to install two (2) contractor furnished temporary cooling towers in the main chilled water plant area, install two (2) Government furnished air handling units in the roof of main building, 2nd floor, and install two (2) Government furnished air cooled chillers in the Community Living center chiller plant area. All at VA Caribbean Healthcare System, San Juan PR. VA intents to negotiate and award a firm-fixed price, sole source, contract with Belkro General Contractors, Inc., a VetBiz Registry database registered and certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concern. 

3. Description of Supplies or Services:  Contractor will provide all labor, materials, tools, equipment, and supervision as required for completing the emergency installations referenced in paragraph 2 above. Work includes rigging, installation of new piping and fittings, electrical connection, ductwork, insulation, and all other necessary fittings. Estimated time for completion is thirty (30) calendar days.

4. Statutory Authority:  

(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5. Validity of Use of Statutory Authority: The Community Living Center and the main chiller plants of the facility are experimenting low flow and high temperature chilled water supply. In addition, two (2) of the air handling units serving the Spinal Cord Unit area in the 4th floor are failing. Ambient conditions in these areas have deteriorated to the point that immediate action is necessary to protect the well-being of employees and patients and improve their quality of life. Belkro General Contractors, Inc. has the required personnel with the expertise necessary to complete the work in the shortest possible time. Mobilization costs and delays are avoided since the contractor is already mobilized at the area working in several renovation projects involving critical areas of the HVAC system including the replacement of the cooling towers. Contractor has successfully completed several critical renovation projects of the infrastructure on time at this site. Contractor has been determined to be responsible with the experience and capability to complete the work in the shortest time possible under these circumstances. Contractor is registered in the CCR and a VetBiz Registry database registered and certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concern.

6. Actions to Promote Competition: This is a one time action.

7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The anticipated price to the Government is $155.000.00. Contractor's proposal will be evaluated against the estimated cost. Negotiations will be held, if required, in order to reach a fair and reasonable price.

8. Market Survey (FAR 10):  No market survey was performed due to the urgent and compelling nature of the work required. Refer to paragraph 5. 

9. Other Considerations:  None 

10. Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: None. Refer to paragraph 5.

11. Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: None. This is a one time action.

12. Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
