<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) anticipates posting a solicitation to procure MONAHRQ - My Own Network, Powered by AHRQ -an innovative software tool from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ. This solicitation will be a total small business set-aside.<br />In 2010, AHRQ introduced MONAHRQ, a free desktop software tool that helps organizations quickly and easily turn healthcare data into a customizable, fully-functional reporting website. Designing and building an effective reporting site can be challenging, expensive, and time consuming. MONAHRQ makes this process easier, thus helping to encourage local healthcare quality measurement and reporting in support of Agency efforts such as greater transparency, comparative reporting, quality improvement, and payment initiatives.<br />The MONAHRQ desktop application allows users to load local healthcare data or information, select data analysis and website customization options, process the data, and generate a full set of website files onto the local computer. Users must host the generated website themselves. A MONAHRQ-generated website can provide information on hospital quality, hospital utilization, potentially avoidable hospital stays, and county rates of hospital use. It targets a variety of audiences such as consumers, providers, and policy makers. It is designed to be easy to use and to follow best practices in public reporting. AHRQ intends to expand the MONAHRQ tool in ways that include:<br />-- Reporting more types of measures.<br />-- Supporting more reporting features.<br />-- Offering more customization options.<br />-- Increasing ease of use.<br />-- Incorporating additional best practices in reporting, including knowledge generated through AHRQ's new initiative on Building the Science of Public Reporting.<br />Offerors must have the capability to redesign and expand the MONAHRQ software in support of Agency goals, to maintain and update the MONAHRQ software, to maintain and update the MONAHRQ download site and related materials, to provide technical assistance to MONAHRQ users, to support and implement strategic planning to improve the MONAHRQ project and to increase MONAHRQ adoption, and to help disseminate MONAHRQ to a broader audience. Qualified offerors must demonstrate substantial experience with quality measurement and reporting and with developing and supporting healthcare-related software tools, databases, and websites. Other tasks will require contractors to manage and coordinate staff in support of MONAHRQ and MONAHRQ users. Organizations are encouraged to participate in this offering that work at the national, state, regional, local, or provider levels and who are engaged in developing, testing, implementing, disseminating, and supporting software tools and websites that help to promote, understand, monitor, or leverage quality measure data or performance in health care delivery.<br />It is anticipated that 1 contract will be awarded prior to 9/30/12 for a base period of 1 year with 4 one year options. It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and monitor the site for any subsequent amendments. All responsible small business firms may submit a proposal which will be evaluated by AHRQ. It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on or about 2/15/12. <br />

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey, on behalf of PM SoldierWeapons, intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a sole source modification to Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace (KDA) under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. FAR 6.302-1(b)(2), The existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, or secret processes; the control of basic raw material; or similar circumstances, make the supplies and services available from only one source.  FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii) (B), Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirement regarding VIM/TIM lens covers for the Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station (CROWS) provided by Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace. The anticipated effort will be a Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) Modification to Contract # W15QKN-07-D-0018. 
The acquisition of CROWS VIM/TIM lens covers from sources other than Kongsberg Defense and Aerospace will not meet the schedule requirements.  It is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in meeting PM SWs requirements as a result of the unacceptable lead times from contract award to the services rendered. A prototype, qualification, and production development time required for any new potential source to develop a solution does not meet the Government schedule requirements. KDA has a production-ready product that has been qualified by the Government.  Failure to meet this timeline will result in a break in the supply of CROWS VIM and TIM lens covers, which provide protection from damage from debris or other contaminants that, may damage the VIM or TIM lens. Damage to the VIM or TIM requires replacing the entire damaged module for a spare VIM or TIM. This replacement process incurs extensive maintenance cost and can result in unacceptable weapon station downtime, as well as detrimental impacts to mission readiness and War fighters safety.  KDA is the only source able to meet the Government's CROWS VIM and TIM lens covers requirements without disclosing KDA's proprietary design.  Please note this notice DOES NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The anticipated award date for this action is the 12th of March 2012.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Number E12PS00012 for Proposed Research on Oil Spill Response Operations in the US Outer Continental ShelfDESCRIPTION:The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the BSEE Oil Spill Response Research (OSRR) Program which includes oil spill planning, preparedness, containment, monitoring, recovery, treatment, and response in the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).  When appropriate, the research shall be conducted consistent with prior research.  For a summary of research recently performed, visit http://www.bsee.gov/Research-and-Training/Oil-Spill-Response-Research-(OSRR).aspx.  Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting White Papers.
BACKGROUND:   
The BSEE OSRR Program is requesting White Papers to be submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement. Authors of selected White Papers will be requested to submit full proposals.  Proposals selected for funding by BSEE may receive funding from Fiscal Year (FY) 2012. The BSEE anticipates that $5,000,000 may be available for the initiation of new research addressing topics identified through this announcement.  The BSEE does not anticipate any one award exceeding $1,000,000.  NOTICE:  The BSEE may share the White Papers with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors shall notify the BSEE if they do not want their White Papers/proposals shared outside of BSEE. The BSEE anticipates awards resultant to this announcement will be made on a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) basis. 
OBJECTIVES: The topics for the FY 2012 oil spill response research funding should be limited to the following topics: 
1.  Feasibility of Conducting Subsea Dispersant Research at Ohmsett  Ohmsett, the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility, located in Leonardo, New Jersey, is a government owned facility.  It is the largest outdoor saltwater wave/tow tank facility in North America where full-scale oil spill response equipment testing, research, and training can be conducted with crude oil.  Oil spill response researchers need to have an appropriate venue to develop and test technologies pertaining to the use of subsea dispersants at various water depths, dosage rates, oil discharges rates, and pressures.  BSEE would like to explore the feasibility of upgrading the Ohmsett facility to accommodate those needs.  This project would include determining the necessary capabilities to conduct subsea dispersant research; the feasibility of upgrading Ohmsett to house those capabilities; and an estimation of costs associated with implementation of those upgrades.
2.  Ice Month at Ohmsett  Recovery of oil in ice presents unique challenges.  In order to stimulate development of new mechanical and/or chemical technologies, BSEE plans to conduct an Ice Month at Ohmsett during the winter of 2012/2013.  BSEE will pay for the costs associated with tank preparation, which would include filling the test area with broken ice, and usage.  Those wishing to take advantage of this opportunity are advised that they must pay for travel expenses of their personnel and transport of their device to the Ohmsett facility.  It is anticipated that each device/technology test that was selected to participate in this activity would involve not more that five days of tank time.  Device/technology developers who would like to test their devices at Ohmsett must submit a White Paper with information about their device/technology, including any tests previously conducted, and a clear statement about how their device/technology will advance the state of the art of Arctic spill response.  
3.  Dispersant Use Impact on Worker Safety  Reports from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill response effort indicate that the use of dispersants, in both surface and subsurface applications, had an impact on the surface Volatile organic compounds (VOC) levels.  Further research is needed in this area to clearly quantify these potential impacts and to develop recommendations to optimize dispersant use for VOC control and worker safety.
4.  Subsea Chemical Dispersant Research  The Deepwater Horizon incident introduced the operational use of dispersants for subsurface injection in deepwater and ultra deepwater. BSEE is interested in additional research in this topic in the areas of: Testing and evaluation of methods, dispersant application ratios, and injection nozzle designs to optimize subsea dispersant application directly into a blowout plume, wellhead, blowout preventer, flowline, or pipeline regardless of water depth. The effects of ambient high pressure, high oil temperature, cold water, and the presence of methane and sediment on dispersant effectiveness. Arctic implications of subsea dispersant use.
5.  Methods to Increase Encounter Rate for Skimming and In Situ Burn Operations BSEE is seeking White Papers that address methods to increase the amount/thickness of oil on the surface of the water in the immediate area of skimming and/or burning operations.  These methods could involve the use of chemicals, new/enhanced mechanical systems, or new/enhanced operational procedures.  
6.  Mechanical Technologies to Facilitate and Improve Oil Spill Containment andRecovery Under Arctic Conditions  BSEE is seeking White Papers on the testing and evaluation of new or innovative mechanical technologies that will facilitate and improve the containment, recovery, and processing of spilled oil in cold water and/or broken ice conditions. This includes full scale prototype, commercial, and non-commercially available technologies, and/or adaptations of existing technologies to contain, recover, and process oil in a range of conditions that include cold water and/or broken ice conditions. White Papers should focus on the environmental and oceanographic conditions typically found in the Alaskan Beaufort and Chukchi Seas, where oil exploration and development activities are planned or are currently taking place. Incorporation/consideration of traditional knowledge into any research project that involves oil spill response under Arctic conditions is encouraged.
7.  Remote Sensing Techniques- BSEE is seeking White Papers that address the use of various remote sensing techniques to improve and facilitate the efficiency of various response countermeasures (mechanical containment and recovery, in situ burning, and the use of dispersants) during an oil spill. These techniques could encompass a variety of methods and be hosted on a variety of platforms.  White Papers should include information on equipment capabilities and limitations, data download and dissemination capabilities, real-time data communication capabilities with response assets, and integration of data into the overall response control systems.  Technologies/techniques that have previously undergone some degree of development should clearly indicate how funding by BSEE will advance the state of the art.
8.  Mechanical Technologies to Facilitate and Improve Surface Oil Spill Containment - BSEE is seeking White Papers on the testing and evaluation of new, or innovative mechanical technologies that will capture and contain oil on the waters surface. This includes full-scale prototype, commercial, and non-commercially available, and/or adaptations of existing technologies. White Papers should focus on surface containment systems that can be rapidly deployed at a spill source, can contain oil in a variety of sea states and wind conditions, use new or improved anchoring methods, minimize oil loss due to entrainment, can withstand heavy loading from large volumes of oil, and/or designs that optimize on-water oil capture.
9.  Mechanical Technologies to Facilitate and Improve Subsea Oil SpillContainment and Removal - BSEE is seeking White Papers on subsea oil spill containment and removal option.  These include: The testing and evaluation of new or innovative mechanical technologies that will contain oil released from pipelines, manifolds, valves, or other production equipment located on the seafloor in water depths of up to 10,000 feet. This includes full-scale prototype, commercial, and non-commercially available, and/or adaptations of existing technologies. White Papers should focus on systems that are rapidly deployable to the spill locations in offshore waters.   The development of design/operating standards and to reassess surface containment/recovery performance standards.
10.  In situ Burning  The Deepwater Horizon oil spill response effort included large scale in situ burning of the oil on the waters surface.  BSEE is interested in additional research in this topic in the areas of:
 New technology for recovery of sunken in situ burn residue. Enhanced designs for the containment and burning of the oil.  Decision-making guidance pertaining to the stockpiling of fire-proof materials. Development of onsite protocols for safety issues.

1.	General:

The contractor shall furnish all necessary materials, supplies, equipment, personnel, supervision, and travel costs to provide for a complete 100% physical inventory of the inpatient and Outpatient West Haven VA Medical Center pharmacy located at 950 Campbell Ave, West Haven, CT 06516-2770 and at the Newington VAMC, 555 Willard Ave, Newington, CT 06111-2631.

.   Vendor shall provide all labor and materials to conduct a physical inventory count of pharmacy medication for VA CT Healthcare System. The physical inventory shall be provided against the THREE following Pharmacy accounts: 

OUTPATIENT WEST HAVEN, INPATIENT WEST HAVEN AND NEWINGTON. 
              
The vendor must be able to utilize VA CT's prime vendor files (McKesson).Vendor shall incorporate these files into computer program in order to input the VA's pharmacy inventory information into the vendors machinery and the inventory service reports. The estimated dollar amount from 2011 is $1,632,802.60.  
              
According to the vendor (RGIS) the cost of this service is determined in the following manner.  cost equals $4.55 of every $1000.00 of actual inventory dollar value. The precise cost is determined after the inventory is done.  

Total dollar value of what is scanned, on the days of the inventories for the three sites, is added up . This amount is then divided by 1000 then multiplied by 4.55.  
              
Taking into consideration the dollar value of last year's inventory($1,632,802.60), IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE COST OF THE INVENTORY WILL BE AROUND $7429.25.  
              
This amount may be higher due to the pharmacy's 'open market' issues and CMOP (pharmacy's mail order) rejects that have demanded an increase in medication stock.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6072, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br />Description<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control &amp; Population Science (DCCPS), plans to procure on a sole source bases with Cancer Care, Inc., 275 Seventh Ave., New York, NY 10001 for the Cancer Survivorship Teleconferences to be held May 15, 2012 and June 19, 2012.
<p>The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 624190 and the business size standard in $7.0M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be from February 20, 2012 or date of award, whichever is later through July 29, 2012.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this procurement.</p>
<p>As the understanding of the many challenges attendant to the treatment for and recovery from cancer increases, the imperative to communicate this information to survivors, their family members and their healthcare providers has grown in parallel. When treatment ends, people often expect life to return to the way it was before the cancer diagnosis. This rarely occurs. Understanding what to expect after cancer treatment can help survivors and their families plan for follow-up care, identify the &lsquo;normal' course of recovery but also appreciate when a problem may need more attention, make appropriate lifestyle changes, and stay hopeful.</p>
<p>The most significant hurdle is reaching those most in need of this information. While educational groups and booklets are helpful, they may not be readily accessible to large numbers of survivors. In addition, as the long-term and late effects of treatment change over time, staying current with these and techniques to manage them also poses a challenge.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide one (1) custom developed teleconference to communicate and inform all survivors, family and friends what to expect after cancer treatment and provide them with evidence-based information, largely generated from work supported by NCI-funded investigators on best practices or interventions for promoting health and reducing cancer-related morbidity. The teleconference allows the NCI's Office of Cancer Survivorship to improve the quality of life of as well as the length of survival for all those diagnosed with this disease. The teleconference workshop program is available to the public, including anyone who has access to a telephone or computer.</p>
<p>The contractor shall: 1) develop the Survivorship teleconference program content format; 2) develop and disseminate announcement materials to its extensive cancer patient/survivor and oncology professional mailing list (of 21,000 or more) and mailing lists provided by the NCI COR; 3) develop the web platform for and coordinate the online and mailed registration; 4) develop and disseminate an evaluation form; 5) be responsible for all technical aspects of the teleconference set-up and delivery; 6) serve as co-moderator; 7) develop and maintain an online archive of the workshop for public access; 8) provide a summary of the workshop; and 9) provide oncology licensed social workers with master's degree in social work who are trained in addressing the psychosocial aspects of cancer survivorship and referral resources, to service phone lines for callers with questions following each teleconference.</p>
<p>CancerCare, Inc. is the nation's oldest and largest not-for-profit organization dedicated to providing professional support services to people with all types of cancer and their loved ones. Founded in 1944, they offer a full range of services provided by professional oncology social workers to more than 110,831 patients, loved ones, and healthcare professionals per year. CancerCare was an early pioneer in the development and delivery of educational teleconferences, currently serving over 45,000 individuals in the US and abroad. CancerCare has a well-established promotion and outreach strategy for cancer education teleconference participation which includes: an extensive and highly targeted mailing list of over 22,000 names of cancer patients and survivors; healthcare providers and advocates who work with this population; technological infrastructure to support telephonic coordination of over 5,000 national and international call-ins to workshops. Over the past 21 years CancerCare has also developed the necessary expertise (e.g., trained full-time oncology professional staff) and infrastructure (e.g., mailing list, teleconference technology, web cast/podcast capacity) to support and conduct successful teleconferences focused specifically on cancer. Specifically, CancerCare has trained staff of licensed, master's level social workers trained in dealing with the after-effects of cancer, who can address questions from workshop participants and can direct participants to referral resources; a web-based infrastructure for coordinating registration, archiving, and distribution of workshops; and staff and infrastructure to execute and coordinate workshop evaluation.</p>
<p>CancerCare's established reputation for delivering high quality cancer-education teleconference programs, facilitated by oncology social work professionals highly skilled in the management of cancer support services and care, is unique. CancerCare's proficiency is evident in that the organization offers approximately 55 cancer-related educational teleconference programs each year. The organization's extensive mailing list and outreach to cancer survivorship communities, vast technological infrastructure, reputation for excellence in cancer care service, and compassionate trained social workers and other health professionals make CancerCare a unique, and efficient vehicle to disseminate evidence-based cancer survivorship research and information to the public pertinent to NCI's mission. Access to these latter professionals has also been critical to the success of their programs as it means that those who participate in a workshop have available after each call staff knowledgeable about the issues discussed and resources to address these ensuring that all callers can receive assistance. NCI is unaware of any other entity that can provide the professional clinical social work back-up services supplied by Cancer Care. Because education about the late effects of cancer may induce stress in participant listeners, it is critical that this social work backup system is in place for NCI's calls. In summary, to the best of NCI's knowledge there is no organization that can deliver this unique set of technical, clinical, and cancer-community-specific expertise.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on February 14, 2012. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax). An original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Ward, Contract Specialist, at wardmr@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-120030-MW on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY.</strong>
<p>Human influenza pandemics continue to be a public health concern. Four human influenza pandemics have occurred in the past century. BARDA has recently completed the preparation and response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus. The WHO estimates approximately 59% case fatality of the currently circulating H5N1 avian influenza virus. At this time it is uncertain which influenza virus variant will cause the next pandemic. <br /><br />The BARDA Strategic Plan 2011-2016 outlines the approach to enhance national MCM preparedness and response. BARDA plans to continue the programs for the development and procurement of MCM for pandemic influenza preparedness and response. <br /><br />To accomplish this goal, BARDA intends to publish a Request for Proposals for the supply of the following items and/or services: pre-pandemic master/working virus seeds; pre-pandemic and pandemic pilot, clinical and commercial bulk vaccines and adjuvants; storage and stability studies of vaccines and adjuvants; formulation-fill-finish of vaccine and adjuvants; preclinical and clinical studies with pre-pandemic and pandemic vaccine; international shipping; storage services and stability program for vaccine and adjuvants, (bulk and final containers) from current contracts when applicable; and disposal of vaccine bulk and final containers. <br /><br />The Department of Health and Human Services through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) contemplates single or multiple awards of contracts to companies that meet the following mandatory criteria: <br /><br />The offeror shall produce vaccines against influenza and influenza strains with pandemic potential; shall demonstrate a successful experience in the manufacturing of influenza vaccine by: <br />&bull; Holding a US influenza vaccine license OR <br />&bull; Have developed an influenza vaccine as evidenced by: <br />o A complete final Phase 3 clinical study report AND <br />o A documented BLA in preparation. <br /><br />The anticipated period of performance will be for a total of up to five (5) years or sixty (60) months with a potential for two (2) one (1) year option periods. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available electronically through the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (www.fbo.gov) on or about February 14, 2012, with proposals being due on or about April 2, 2012.</p>
<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor this website (www.fbo.gov) for the release of the solicitation as well as any amendments to the solicitation. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and any amendments via this website. No collect calls will be accepted.

All responses and/or inquiries concerning this requirement MUST be identified with the RFP number, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, email address and should be submitted to the primary and/or secondary point of contact&nbsp;identified in this notice.</p>

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Mid-Atlantic Region, has a need for professional services and Tier Certification for the Social Security Administration National Support Center.  These services include consulting support in reviewing the program of requirements, design documents and construction of the new data center facility.  Certification in accordance with the Uptime Tier Classification System is also required within this scope.

GSA intends to award a sole source contract to Uptime Institute Professional Services, 20 West 37th Street, Floor 6, New York, New York, 10018-7368 to provide these services under the authority of FAR 13.501(a), Test Program for Commercial Items.
The Uptime Institute Professional Services is the only firm licensed to rate and certify the Uptime Institutes Tier Classification system.  Therefore, it is essential to include the Uptime Institute Professional Services during design development for consulting services and design progress reviews, as well as provide Tier Certification to the design documents.  Tier Certification of the design documents is a prerequisite for the Tier Certification of the constructed facility.  The Uptime Institute Professional Services will also be required to provide this Tier Certification for the constructed facility.  No other firm can provide Uptime Tier Certification.  The Uptime Institute developed the Tier Classification System and is the only firm that may provide the certification.  

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.501(a). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing or by email to Daria Giannotti, daria.giannotti@gsa.gov.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI), USDA APHIS (For Information Purposes Only)
<p>Purpose:<br />The purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research to gain knowledge and help the Government understand the availability of solutions and tools able to satisfy the needs of the USDA APHIS Animal Disease Traceability (ADT) system to enhance animal disease tracing activities.</p>
<p>Background:<br />USDA APHIS ADT provides the livestock industries maximum flexibility in the choices available for official ID devices. Procedures are in place with States and Tribes to manage tag allocation and distribution activities for all official ID tags. However, with the exception of Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID) and some barcoded devices, retirement of official identification number of animals harvested presents data entry challenges. USDA APHIS is studying the use of other solution to automate the recording of the animal's official identification number from eartags collected at slaughter and rendering facilities to increase efficiencies and data accuracy. A possible solution to this data recording challenge is to have a direct part mark (DPM) of the official identification number imprinted on each visual-only official identification eartag or device during the manufacturing process.</p>
<p>Request for Information:<br />1. Are there animal ID ear tag manufacturers that have the capability to apply a 2-D data matrix DPM to their tags?<br />2. Do any animal ID ear tag manufacturers have data on the longevity of DPMs under field conditions or under controlled laboratory testing? Does the type of metal or plastic affect DPM longevity?<br />3. What does the addition of a DPM add to the cost of an animal ID ear tag? Is there a difference if the ear tag material is plastic or metal?<br />4. What matrix standard is most appropriate for the use of DPM on livestock eartags? <br />5. Are there methods other than DPMs that would allow automated data collection of the official identification number from visual-only tags? How would the cost of each of these alternatives compare with DPMs?<br />6. Any other relevant information, recommendations, and/or comments beneficial to the Government<br />7. Name, Title, contact information, and organization name, as applicable</p>
<p>Responses Due and Point of Contact:<br />Interested manufactures should send a statement of capabilities, your company size standard (small or large business)&nbsp;via email to Leigh Eberhart at Leigh.D.Eberhart@aphis.usda.gov</p>

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only seeking responses from Small Businesses. Large and Non Profit Businesses are not to respond. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (i.e., HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned, Veteran-Owned, and Small Disadvantaged Business) relative to this 541990 NAICS Code. Teaming is encouraged. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only.
<p>The intended contract shall provide the Government the option to extend the contract in one-year increments for a base and four option years. After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement a solicitation announcement may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities at a later time. Responses to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) and must respond to the questions listed below. In addition, please provide a capability statement addressing your organization's ability to perform as a prime contractor the work described below.</p>
<p>Project Title: Provider Business Operations Learning Networks (PBOLW)</p>
<p>The mission of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is to bring effective substance abuse and mental health programs to every community. SAMHSA carries out this mission by compiling prevention, treatment and rehabilitation knowledge, identifying and promoting science-based programs, and building capacity at the State and regional levels to infuse prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation knowledge and programs into every community in the United States.</p>
<p>Contracts developed by the Administrator's Office of Policy Planning and Innovation are designed to develop and disseminate knowledge on laws, regulations, policies, and innovative and evidence-based practices impacting the regulation, financing, delivery, evaluation, and coordination of prevention, treatment, and recovery support services for individuals with mental health and substance use problems. Starting in 2009, SAMHSA implemented a systematic program to disseminate knowledge on effective business operations practices to the substance abuse and mental health treatment and related fields. Through SAMHSA's work, a pioneering form of business practices knowledge dissemination has been developed; termed a "provider learning network." Provider learning networks build seamlessly upon existing state provider association networks and events to bring tailored, relevant educational resources to community behavioral health providers. The Provider Business Operations Learning Networks (PBOLW) contract builds upon this preliminary work.</p>
<p>The current learning network activities have only begun to address the needs of community mental health and substance abuse prevention, treatment, and recovery organizations for learning opportunities on a wide range of business operations practices. Under health reform, behavioral health providers will need to respond to a broad range of business operations development challenges. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) will significantly enhance access to the prevention, treatment and recovery support services for persons with, or at risk of, mental and substance use disorders. According to SAMHSA's 2010 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), Behavioral Health treatment providers will need to be prepared to provide services to up to an additional 11 million uninsured people with behavioral health problems who will be eligible to receive affordable coverage through Medicaid or a subsidized private insurance plan sold within a newly established health insurance exchange. There is a critical need to ensure that community based behavioral health providers develop the business operations capacity to function efficiently and effectively under the redesigned health insurance, MHPAEA and Block Grant programs. Historically, community based treatment providers have carried the major responsibility for providing evidence based treatment and recovery support services to low income and vulnerable populations who are most in need of behavioral health services.</p>
<p>The PBOLW contractor must support this model of knowledge dissemination and offerors should demonstrate how they will collaborate and integrate with the ongoing activities of intra-state, state, and regional provider associations. The provider business operations contract will address a number of diverse knowledge application activities in a cost effective and coordinated manner. These activities will include the repurposing and updating as needed of provider business operations educational resources provided by the COTR and other available resources into discreet learning curricula. There will be five discreet learning curricula topics including the following subject areas: 1. Strategic business planning in an era of health reform, 2. Third-party billing and compliance, 3. Third-party contract negotiation, 4. Enrollee eligibility determination and enrollment assistance for public medical assistance programs (i.e. Medicaid), and 5. Adoption of Health information technology to meaningful use standards. The offeror should demonstrate how they will access existing provider business operations learning material resources and how they plan on developing the 5 curricula in accordance with adult learning principles.</p>
<p>Your responses to the questions provided below will assist the Government in selecting the appropriate acquisition method. Page limit: Maximum 11 pages (font size 10 or larger). A copy of the company capability statement will also be accepted. Responses are due on February 14, 2012. The anticipated period of performance is one year with four one year option periods. After review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and formal solicitation may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities.</p>
<p>Only Small Businesses need to respond to this sources sought. Response to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) and must respond to the following questions:</p>

<p>The purpose of the Technical Interchange/Lab Day is to assist with the development planning for Data Fusion, Cross Domain Solution, and User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) in support of the 624 Operations Center.

In order to provide meaningful information that will enhance situational awareness, discrete variables are needed to be individually considered for correlation, aggregation, or other forms of analysis that will reduce the cognitive burden of operators and facilitate effective course of action (COA) development and decision making for classified and unclassified information. The Industry Day will be held in the MITRE Facility, Bedford, MA 01730. Specifics are provided in following paragraphs:</p>
<p>1. CONFERENCE: The conference will take place on 14 and 15 March 2012 from 0730 - 1800 hours (EDT) at the MITRE Facility, M Building, 202 Burlington Road, Bedford, MA 01730. The conference will be UNCLASSIFIED.</p>

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to extend a task order with SecTek, Inc., for protective servicesand increase the order value on a sole-source basis, pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c)(1), OnlyOne Responsible Source, for open market items not currently on its GSA Federal SupplySchedule. The current task order was awarded under GSA Schedule Number GS-07F-0279M andNASA delivery order number NNG08AZ01D. Services performed under the GSA schedule orderinclude uniformed operations, access control, traffic control, 911 operations, rovingpatrols, locksmiths, emergency medical services, personnel security, and protection ofpersonnel and property. This requirement is within the scope of the current task order,however, some of the costs related to providing the service are not under the GSASchedule contract. The open market items are incidental to the overall protectiveservices requirement. Competition is not available as the open market items integrallysupport the GSA Schedule services and cannot be separately competed. This action will support service from March 1, 2012, through September 30, 2012, withseven one-month options to go through April 30, 2013. The Government will award a firmfixed price modification for the extension of this commercial service.This notice is for information purposes only and is not considered a Request for Proposal(RFP). No solicitation will be posted on this website for this requirement. Adetermination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon the responsesto this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. The Governmentwill not be responsible for any costs incurred by an interested party responding to thisnotice.The Government is currently working on a follow-on procurement for protective services atGSFC. To avoid a break in service, an extension to the GSA schedule order is necessary. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<RESPDATE>020312
<CONTACT>Bryan O'Shaughnessy, Contract Specialist, Phone 7036487308, Email bposhaughnessy@usgs.gov
<DESC><p>Intent to Award Language:</p>
<p><br />The US Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for software licenses for&nbsp; Virtalis Incorperated's&nbsp;GeoVisionary 3D software.</p>
<p>The USGS is aware of no other source that can provide the above. Therefore, it intends to make an award to Vertalis, Inc., unless it is contacted by any vendor who believes they obtained similar technical expertise and can provide the same service. Vendors are invited to contact the Contract Specialist, Bryan O'Shaughnessy&nbsp;(<a href="mailto:bposhaughnessy@usgs.gov">bposhaughnessy@usgs.gov</a>) no later than 12:00 PM EST, Friday, February 3, 2012 with an affirmative answer. <br /><br />The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) considers employee signatures to be Personal Protected Information, and therefore all employee signatures have been redacted. By posting this document, the Contracting Officer attests all appropriate signatures have been obtained.</p>
<p>SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION STATES THE FOLLOWING PART:</p>
<p>The following information is provided to demonstrate the proposed contractor's unique qualifications:</p>
<p>USGS has enterprise licenses and is a consortium member for development of the British Geological Survey (BGS) GSI3D because of its unique applications for field geologists and geologic mapping and hydrologic analyses. A growing number of USGS researchers and technical experts are using GSI3D. GeoVisionary is companion software developed by the BGS and the private company Virtalis, specifically to be the visualization tool for GSI3D.</p>
<p>Natoinal Cooperative Geological Mapping Program (NCGMP) provides accurate geologic maps and three-dimensional framework models in accordance National Geologic Mapping Act. These maps are used by State and municipal planning, conservation, and resource managers, private sector companies such as energy (oil, gas, electric, nuclear), geoscience firms, and land and resource managers in Federal agencies such as National Park Service (NPS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).</p>
<p>NCGMP requires the ability to smoothly stream terabytes of terrain and imagery data and panning and zooming actions that are executed quickly with no stalling or obvious redrawing of the scene. No other program can display the same volume of data as GeoVisionary on standard desktop PCs which is required by NCGMP researchers for producing three-dimensional geologic maps.</p>
<p>The program requires geological cross sections and 3D models that can be imported from the subsurface geology modeling program GSI3D, and Geovisionary has this capability. The size of, resolution of, and speed with which multiple datasets can be displayed are integral to producing three-dimensional geologic maps.</p>
<p>The program office and contracting conducted market research and was unable to identify a product or vendor other than Virtalis'&nbsp;GeoVisionary&nbsp;3D&nbsp;that could provide a product that meets the agencies requirement.</p>

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notice of Intent - Sole Source</span>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Computer Security Division (CSD), intends to negotiate with North Carolina State University, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to obtain the services described below.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></strong> <br />Since 2009, CSD has developed a prototype system - the Access Control Property Tool (ACPT), which allows a user to compose, verify, test and generate access control policies. ACPT has been successfully completed and made available as beta version in http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/acpt/index.html. The ACPT beta version allows policy authors to compose and combine policies based on predefined templates of practical policy models such as Mandatory Access Control (MAC), Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC), Multi-Level security, and workflow models. ACPT converts resulting models with user-provided attributes to machine-readable Extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) representation, which can be directly enforced by information sharing entities. In addition to policy composition and combination, the ACPT verifies the composed/combined access control models and rules against the policy author specified security or privacy properties to ensure that there is no contradiction or leakage from the access control rules and properties. At the end, the ACPT generates access control test suites through combinatorial test generator, which generates tests with the same effectiveness as exhausting testing enables and with capability of finding faults in the policy implementations such as those written in XACML or other application languages.</p>
<p>The Department of Computer Science of North Carolina State University (NC State) has worked in cooperation with the NIST Computer Security Division for the research of Property Verification of Access Control Policy and ACPT tool prototyping since 2007 performing the following:</p>
<p>1. NC State developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based Access Control Policy Testing (ACPT) tool system for designing, verifying, and testing access control policies. with the following functions:</p>
<p>a) The model templates allow the privacy and security policy composition and combination. The templates support policy models based on the local and federal policy status applied to shared entities.</p>
<p>b) The property verification function verify the conformance of the composed and combined policy models against the security and privacy properties specified by predicate logic with policy attributes.</p>
<p>c) Generation of an XACML-represented access control policy from the resulting model of steps a) and b). The XACML policy complies with the XACML standard version 2.0 and supports the Policy Decision Point (PDP) operation of information sharing entities.</p>
<p>d) Generation of a combinatorial test suite based on NIST's ACTS (Advanced Combinatorial Testing System) technology. The test suite contains the access requests in the form of recognized access queries for shard resources access for testing the implementation of the access control policy.</p>
<p>2. NC State delivered the code, technical user manuals, and operation guidance for ACPT as described in item 1 to NIST, and present resulting publications in conferences including international conferences.</p>
<p>3. NC State provides sample privacy and security policies that demonstrate all functions of the ACPT as stated in item 1 for the NIST implemented information sharing test bed.</p>
<p>NIST has a requirement for continued development of the ACPT, which requires 1), the knowledge gained from previous developing work, 2), the knowledge of the access control policy testing resulted from NC State's research work, which market research demonstrated that other research institutes do not have.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 541690. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to North Carolina State University for this requirement for a period of nine months.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST to provide the required services may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before February 10, 2012 at 4 pm EST. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov.</p>

This software uses a solution of the Schrodinger Equation to describe the space and time dependence of quantum mechanical systems. This approach is used when the study requires a fit determination between two molecules (i.e. a protein and ligand or a drug compound and a cellular membrane). Four significant functions provided by this software are 1) fast and accurate prediction of ligand induced conformational changes in receptor active sites, 2) efficient rank-ordering of compounds and prediction binding affinities, 3) protein preparation correction algorithm for common structural problems and creating reliable, all atom protein models, and 4) M-polarized ligand docking is substantially enhanced accuracy over pure molecular modeling algorithms. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability. Respond to this requirement by submitting written capabilities/specifications to the Contracting Specialist at the address stated in this synopsis. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 8 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within 8 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, the order will be issued to Schrodinger, Inc. The NAICS Code/Size is 511210/$25.0 Million. This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures-Commercial Item Acquisition in conjunction with FAR Part 12 Commercial Item Acquisition of Commercial Items. There is no solicitation package available. For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Dee Lunney via email lunney@niehs.nih.gov.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

[Maximo Archiving]At[NPS, Park Facility Mnaagement Division (PFMD)]
As required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.3, authority is herein requested to contract on a sole source for procurement of Maximo Archiving COTS software for the Park Facility Management Division (PFMD) in support of National Park Service Facility Management Software System (FMSS). In accordance with 41 U.S.C.  253(c), this justification is submitted to request award of a contract to Asset Partners of Chicago, IL, for Archive Pro Maximo Archiving software and maintenance.
As specified by FAR 6.303-2, Content, the following are the facts and rationale to justify the use of the specific authority cited.
(1)	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for other than Full and Open Competition."
The agency is the U.S. Department of the Interior acting through the National Park Service, PFMD. The Contracting activity is the National Park Service WASO-WCP.  This document is a Justification for other than Full and Open Competition.
(2)	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.
Procure a commercial off the shelf (COTS) application (Archive Pro) that provides archiving capability for the servicewide FMSS (Maximo Enterprise Asset Management) application in support of PFMD requirements.
(3)	Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).
The contractor will provide the Archive Pro application and intial installation support, with continued annual maintenance support for upgrades and ongoing technical support services. The estimated cost for this requirement is estimated to be $300,000 over a 10 -year term. $100,000 for initial procurement and installation, then 20% annual maintenance and support.
(4)	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.
FAR 6.302-1(c)
(5)	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.Market research, web searches, and networking within the DOI Maximo user community has indicated that there is no viable alternative to the proposed Archive Pro COTS product with the exception of an IBM sourced product (Optim) that was reviewed but found not satisfactory for the needs of the NPS (it required too much customization and resources to maintain) and it's intial estimated cost was in excess of $600,000 (and 10 year cost of  $1,800,000) based on the IBM license scheme. 
(6)	A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.
N/A
(7)	A determination by the contacting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.
It is anticipated that the basis for determining fair and reasonable pricing will be to compare it to the independent government estimate. 
(8)	A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.
Reviewed and discussed the only other known alternative (IBM Optim), with IBM and the PFMD technical consultant, DIT. Optim was found to be: technically inefficient for a large database such as FMSS; it required a phased archiving approach, involving additional ongoing  resources (labor $$); had no restore functionality; and was expensive initially and for annual maintenance.Polled other DOI bureaus on what they had done or were planning to do regarding Maximo archiving. Due to the high cost of the IBM solution, no one had proceeded to do any in depth analysis of the IBM product or any archiving product.Web searches on Maximo archiving and the likereturned no other alternatives.Polls within the Maximo User community resulted in no  non-IBM products known other than Archive Pro.
(9)	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.
We have done discovery and analysis on the Archive Pro application against the FMSS database and expect it to fully meet the needs of the NPS as a COTS program.
(10)	A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.
None
(11)	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.
N/A
(12)	Contracting Officer certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.
As the approving Contracting Officer, I hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

As previous contract holder for 4.5 years, Apex has intrinsic knowledge, which allows them to respond to the EPA faster than any other vendor.  They currently provide several mission critical services to the Government that cannot be interrupted while the five-year requirement is being competed.  Among these critical services are the following: emergency clean up services, storage of sensitive items, property accountability services, space reconfiguration, shipment and receiving of Government property and collection of recyclable materials.  Additional details justifying this action can be found in the attached Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition.</p>

The winning proposal will feature a site-specific, temporary work that commemorates the founding principles and legacy of Earth Day-an environmental subject not otherwise represented in the city's commemorative landscape-and which does so in a way that expands the palette of form and material for commemorative works in Washington.<br /></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri"><br />Project Background<br /></span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">Historically, commemorative installations and memorials in Washington have been designed for the ages. They tend to feature works of stone and granite, set within a solemn landscape that often encompasses multiple acres dedicated solely to a commemorative purpose. Construction costs are high; recent projects range between sixty to one hundred twenty million dollars in costs. The Commemorative Works Act established a process for evaluating the subject matter, location, and form of permanent commemorative works in the Washington region, and the process can be complex and lengthy. It begins with an act of Congress, and often takes 10 years until project realization.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">In 2010, NCPC sponsored a forum entitled <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Beyond Granite: Global Approaches to Public Art and Placemaking</em>. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The program featured public artists and arts administrators discussing temporary works such as the World Trade Center <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Tribute in Light</em> and London's <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Fourth Plinth</em> program in Trafalgar Square. Panelists discussed how a program of temporary commemorative works could be used to enrich the cultural landscape in Washington, DC, by providing a means to recognize issues and events that might not otherwise fit within the confines of the Commemorative Works Act, while alleviating the pressure of demands for permanent memorial sites in the Monumental Core. Such a program would also create opportunities for artists to experiment with new and dynamic kinds of designs and materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-style: italic">The <em>Beyond Granite</em> competition has been</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri"> conceived to pick up where this conversation left off. The goal of the competition is to encourage more public dialogue about alternative ways to commemorate, and also to experiment with temporary forms of commemoration that can contribute to more vital public spaces within the nation's capital.&nbsp;<br /></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri"><br />Site Description<br /></span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">The site is a grassy semi-circle along 12<sup>th</sup> Street NW in the Federal Triangle area of Washington, DC. Immediately in front of the Ariel Rios Federal Building, it is known as the Ariel Rios Hemicycle. Although the site is adjacent to the Federal Triangle Metrorail Station and is a nexus for vehicular and pedestrian traffic moving between the National Mall and Pennsylvania Avenue and between the Old Post Office Pavilion and the Woodrow Wilson Plaza, the site itself is underutilized and undistinguished. Through the competition, NCPC and GSA seek to activate the site and make it a more memorable and attractive public space.&nbsp; </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">Concurrent with this competition, NCPC and GSA will be making permanent site enhancements such as new seating and improvements to the landscaping. Any other proposed modifications to the site must not permanently impact the fa&ccedil;ade of the historic Ariel Rios Federal Building, and also must not adversely affect the operations or structure of the Metrorail station located under the site.&nbsp;<br /></span><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri"><br />Competition Theme<br /></span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">While the overall objective of this competition is to explore opportunities created through temporary forms of commemoration, a theme has been identified to provide a focus for competition submissions-that of Earth Day. </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">Earth Day began, and continues as, a grass-roots effort to promote environmental awareness and broaden responsibility for our planet. It is now the largest civic observance in the world, with more than 1 billion people participating. Earth Day continues to inspire individuals, businesses, diverse organizations and communities. Since the first Earth Day in 1970, this annual awareness and educational event has broadened support for environmental actions and programs at the local, national and international levels. In fact, some of the early Earth Day celebrations are now remembered for launching modern environmental awareness. In the U.S., Earth Day inspired passage of many groundbreaking environmental laws and helped lead to the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency, whose offices are housed immediately adjacent to the competition site.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri">NCPC and GSA seek proposals that embody defining precepts of the founding of Earth Day, its legacy, and environmentally sustainable practices. Works should inspire the audience to reflect upon the impact of Earth Day over the past 40 years, environmental achievements going forward, and the challenges that remain. Works also should be site specific, designed to respond to the Hemicycle's urban form and context.<br /></span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri"><br />Scope of Work<br /></span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The selected Artist/Designer (or, if a team, the designated Lead Artist/Designer) will be responsible for producing a final design for NCPC and GSA approval.

<SOLNBR>EASTBRANCHCUTOFFWALL
<ARCHDATE>04302012
<CONTACT>Jeffrey Zbezinski, 412-395-7228

<a href="mailto:jeffrey.j.zbezinski@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Pittsburgh</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to seek parties interested in presenting their capabilities for construction of deep cutoff walls to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh District, for the project at East Branch Dam, Wilcox, PA.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Only Contractors that have relevant experience constructing cutoff walls (to the depths and in the conditions described below) using hydro-cutter, top drive drill, or similar equipment may make presentations to the Pittsburgh District.  Due to the projected scope of cutoff wall construction, an interested offeror shall have a contract bonding capacity of $100 to $250 million. These requirements do not preclude other Contractors from submitting proposals when the solicitation for cutoff wall construction is released.   East Branch Dam is located on the East Branch Clarion River, 7.3 miles upstream of its confluence with the West Branch Clarion River at Johnsonburg, Pennsylvania. <br> <br>The primary component of the construction consists of a concrete cutoff wall constructed through the dam and abutments to an anticipated maximum depth of 260 feet, including an anticipated maximum depth of 170 feet into bedrock.  The wall element thickness will be sufficient to achieve a minimum continuous thickness of 18 inches.  East Branch dam is a compacted earth embankment composed of silt, sand, gravel and contains cobbles and some boulders.  The dam underwent a serious internal erosion event in 1957.   The subsequent repair was incomplete, leaving the dam especially susceptible to additional internal erosion events.  The dam is fragile in the area of this repair as well as generally susceptible to hydrofracture.  Pretreatment by soil-cement mixing will be necessary in the particularly fragile portion of the embankment associated with the 1957 grouted void repair to lessen the risk that cutoff wall construction by the slurry-filled panel method will further damage the dam.  The maximum depth of soil mixing is approximately 150 feet. Based on the best currently available information, the foundation soils have the same general composition as the embankment materials, although they contain more boulders.  Attachment 1 includes photographs of typical foundation soils.  Zones of more permeable and water-bearing gravels are present in the foundation soils. <br> <br>Bedrock is composed primarily of sandstone and shale, although zones of siltstone, limestone and conglomerate are present less frequently.  Unconfined compressive strengths in excess of 20,000 psi are not uncommon within the bedrock. Typical bedrock strength properties obtained during recent explorations at East Branch are summarized in Attachment 2.  The bedrock contains sufficiently permeable zones that pre-grouting will be necessary to permit cutoff wall construction without rapid loss of slurry.   Bedrock is fractured in select zones, particularly near the top of rock, with observed Lugeon Values ranging from zero to in excess of 200 (i.e. water pressure could not be developed at the pumped flowrate).  Two Optical Televiwer Images from a recent exploration, including Lugeon testing results and water losses observed during coring, are shown in Attachment 3.  These images indicate typical bedrock conditions, including the the variability of bedrock conditions between the left abutment and valley center.  <br><br>Interested Contractors shall respond to this request no later than February 17, 2012.  All interested Contractors must be registered in CCR to be eligible for award of Government contracts.  To reserve a time and date to make a presentation, submit a one page corporate fact sheet to Jeff Zbezinski, Contract Specialist at the following e-mail address:  jeffrey.j.zbezinski@usace.army.mil.  This fact sheet will be used to verify that Contractors meet the construction and bonding capabilities described previously.  Presentations will be entertained at the Pittsburgh District Offices, US Army Corps of Engineers, 1000 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15222 from March 19-23, 2012 between the hours of 9:00 am and 3:00 pm.  Presentations shall be limited to a window of two (2)-hours, to include follow-up questions.  The government will provide a projector.<br>  <br>Interested offerors shall provide an electronic copy of their presentation to the Pittsburgh District on a CD or DVD ROM at the presentation session.  Contractors shall also provide 10 hard copies of their presentations to the Pittsburgh District.  After all the presentations are conducted, a complete list of prospective offerors that made presentations will be posted to this announcement, along with questions and responses provided by the Government.  Information provided by a potential offeror will not be disclosed if doing so would reveal the potential offeror's confidential business strategy. <br><br>Contracting Office Address:<br>USACE District, Pittsburgh, 1000 Liberty Avenue, W.S.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>DESCRIPTION:  Using the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals to conduct a 6.3 Research & Development effort in support of the Reconfigurable Rotors program.  The Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  This Broad Agency Announcement constitutes the total solicitation.  There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments.  <br><br>INTRODUCTION:  The Multi-Role Rotor - Adaptive Performance Broad Agency Announcement supports the Reconfigurable Rotors Demonstration Program by demonstrating integrated high performance rotor system technologies to support current and future Army Aviation platforms.  The Reconfigurable Rotors Program is a 4 year 6.3 Advanced Technology Demonstration effort.   The goal of the Reconfigurable Rotors program is to provide improved rotorcraft performance throughout the flight envelope resulting in significantly increased mission capability and survivability through optimization of integrated active and passive rotor features.  The overall program objectives are to demonstrate significant improvements in rotor figure of merit and cruise efficiency (isolated rotor L/De), reductions in rotor vibration levels, and reductions in acoustic signature range.  This program has been broken up into two phases.  The first phase, called Active Rotor Component Demonstration, is an ongoing 12 month effort to identify and address the technology challenges and approaches associated with achievement of the Reconfigurable Rotors program objectives.  The second phase of the Reconfigurable Rotors program is called Multi-Role Rotor - Adaptive Performance. The enabling technologies developed and matured under the Active Rotor Component Demonstration and the DARPA Mission Adaptive Rotor programs are potential, but not required, candidates for this second phase of the Reconfigurable Rotors program to demonstrate significant performance improvements at the integrated, full scale rotor system level.  This BAA is for the Multi-Role Rotor - Adaptive Performance phase only and will demonstrate an integrated advanced rotor system to achieve overall program goals.<br><br>SOLICITATION TOPICS:  There is one topic under this announcement:  <br><br>TOPIC 01-2012:  Multi-Role Rotor - Adaptive Performance<br><br>Current Army rotor systems do not meet the performance requirements (including range, payload, and vibration) and survivability (such as acoustic signature) levels for future missions.  Previous active rotor efforts that matured individual component technologies were hampered by constraints that arise from trying to incorporate new features into existing rotor designs.  These constraints include high centrifugal force (CF) loading on hub components, limited hub motion freedom, and space available in the spar while still maintaining structural integrity and load path continuity.   There is a limit to the performance improvements possible throughout the entire flight envelope when retro-fitting these systems with active components.  Current passive rotor designs are often the result of compromises due to different optimum designs for, among others, hover efficiency versus cruise efficiency, low acoustic signature versus high performance, or the advancing versus the retreating side of the rotor disk.  <br><br>The goals of the Reconfigurable Rotors program are to demonstrate integrated rotor system technologies that, when compared to baseline fielded DoD rotor system, will contribute to:<br><br> 	Reduction in rotor vibrations by at least 90%;<br> 	Reduction in acoustic detection range by 50%; <br> 	Increase in rotor figure of merit by 10%; and<br> 	Increase in cruise efficiency (isolated rotor L/De) by 8%.<br><br>The objective of the Reconfigurable Rotors Phase 2 program is to develop and demonstrate an optimized "clean sheet" active/passive advanced, appropriately scaled, rotor that accentuates active features and avoids the many short comings of retrofitting active technologies to current rotor systems.  By varying the aeromechanic characteristics through use of active control features, the ideal rotor can perform optimally over a wide range of flight conditions.  The performance compromises between competing mission segments (e.g. cruise vs hover) will be eliminated or minimized.  The design of the passive structural and dynamic characteristics should maximize the aeromechanic effects of integrated, active features.  <br><br>The enabling technologies to be integrated, matured, and demonstrated under this topic should directly address the overall Reconfigurable Rotors program goals. Technologies of interest for this topic include both on-blade (including but not limited to leading and trailing edge actuation) and hub-based (such as an active pitch link) active components along with structural and modal tailoring of rotor structures. A suitable risk mitigation and demonstration plan (to include use, maturation, and validation of analytical tools and the facilities required) that defines a building-block, analysis and test approach that culminates in relevant-scale validation of the technology shall be provided.   The selection of technologies for the integrated demonstration system should take into account their maturity, effectiveness, and synergy with the overall rotor system. Validation of technology will be done by demonstrating contribution towards project goals.  A minimum acceptable method of validation shall be wind tunnel testing of relevant-scale, integrated rotor system.  As an alternative, if the appropriate hardware currently exists (or can be modified within available program resources and schedule) and is available to the Government and offeror, the Government will consider a flight test of an active rotor system.  Both methods shall include rigorous correlation of rotor analysis and performance prediction tools.  Adequate time on the overall schedule should be provided for the fabrication and integration of technologies into a demonstration rotor system.<br><br>The integrated rotor system shall be compatible with the operational environment, to include at a minimum, sand and rain erosion, icing, EMI, wide operating temperature range, and battle damage assessment and repair (BDAR), with minimal impact to the baseline vulnerability, susceptibility, reliability, and maintainability. The unique challenges in reliably transferring the required data and power across the rotating frame (rotating component to static airframe) as well as integrated flight controls shall also be considered.             <br>                                                                                                                                                                          <br><br>ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  Anticipated Government funding is $7.8M (FY12: $3M, FY13 $3M, FY14 $1.8M). The Period of Performance for Topic 01 is not to exceed 36 months.  <br><br>Offerors should clearly depict their proposed schedule.  The topic has the potential for multiple awards, which may address only part of the topic's objectives.  However, the Government has a strong desire to demonstrate technology and goals on a full-scale rotor.  Any government award is subject to the availability of funds.  <br><br>TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT:  A variety of funding instruments are available pursuant to this announcement depending upon the proposed effort, the entity submitting the successful proposal(s), and statutory and regulatory requirements the Government must satisfy.  Such instruments include conventional contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented, and Technology Investment Agreements (TIA) (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358) or Other Transaction (OT) for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371), which are more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments.  Under TIA's or OT(s) it is DoD policy to obtain, to the maximum extent practical, cost sharing of half of the cost of the project to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project.  Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R paragraph 34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) (but also see paragraph 37.530 pertaining to Other Transactions for Research) accessible at the following link: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/321006r34p.pdf.  Contract type is a subject for negotiation, but the offeror's desire should be clearly stated in the cost proposal.  <br><br>DATA ITEMS / DELIVERABLES:  All awards under this announcement will require a kickoff meeting following award.  All awards under this Announcement will require delivery of the following data items:  (1) Program Management Plan, (2) Test Plan (if applicable), (3) Bi-Monthly Performance and Cost Reports (4) Final Report, (5) Technology Maturation and Transition Plan, and (6) Executable software (if applicable).  All awards will include a requirement to present the results of the work in a final briefing at Ft. Eustis, Virginia upon completion of all technical effort.  <br><br>SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:  Performance will require access to and/or generation of technical data the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec. 2751 et. seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50, U.S.C. App. 2401 et. seq.  Prior to award, the successful offeror(s) will be required to (if applicable) provide an "Export-Controlled DoD Data Agreement" certification number issued in accordance with DoD Directive 5230.25.  This certification may be requested from the Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FBA Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI  49017-3084, Telephone 1-800-352-3572.  This Announcement is available only to U.S. firms.<br><br>GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT:  It is the offeror's responsibility to identify, coordinate, and furnish supporting documentation for use of any Government furnished equipment.  <br><br>DATA RIGHTS:  The Government desires, at a minimum, "Government Purpose Rights" as defined by the DFARS 252.227-7013, to all technical data, deliverables, and computer software to be delivered.  It is the offeror's responsibility to clearly acknowledge or take exception to the Government's desire for at least "Government Purpose Rights."  The Contractor should propose legends for each data item identified as other than unlimited rights.  <br><br>PREPARATION & SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS  <br><br>Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  <br><br>Proposals:  The proposal shall consist of two volumes, a technical volume and a cost volume.   In presenting the proposal material, prospective Offerors are advised that the quality of the information is significantly more important than quantity.  Offerors should confine the submissions to essential matters providing sufficient information to define their offer and establish an adequate basis for the Government to conduct its evaluation.  Offerors may submit multiple proposals. <br><br>PROPOSAL TECHNICAL VOLUME:  The technical volume of the proposal shall provide detail that justifies the benefits of the proposed technology relative to the topic objectives. The technical volume shall also include a clear statement of the technical objectives, the specific approach (including analysis tools) to be pursued and supporting background experience. It shall contain a Statement of Work (SOW), milestones, a biographical section describing key personnel, a description of the facilities and/or data sources to be employed in the effort, and a draft program management plan. Offerors shall identify and substantiate the beginning and ending Technology Readiness Levels. <br><br>Volume I (Technical) shall be written and shall consist of a maximum of fifty pages exclusive of title page, section dividers, table of contents, list of figures/tables, glossary of terms and cross-referencing indices.  The evaluators will read only up to the maximum number of pages specified. Submission shall be limited to the number of pages specified, total inclusive of any drawings, charts, etc.  Type shall be no smaller than a font size of ten (10) and shall be at least single spaced.  Page size shall not exceed 8  " x 11".  Fold-out illustrations required for reader ease are allowed, however, illustration shall be counted in 8  " x 11" increments (e.g., a 11" x 17" document will count as two pages).   Except for the Technical Volume, the number of proposal pages is not limited.<br><br>PROPOSAL COST VOLUME:  Within the Cost Proposal, offerors shall indicate the proposed funding instrument (e.g., FAR-based contract and type (cost-share, cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost reimbursable, etc.) or TIA).  The Cost Proposal should include a funding profile (a cost breakout by month), cost breakdown providing man-hours with justification and monthly costs by task, all pricing rates used, travel and equipment and materials listings, if applicable. Subcontractor proposals, including pricing rate details, should be provided concurrent with the prime contractor's submission.  Any cost share will be calculated as follows: contractor cash plus in-kind contribution divided by project value.  Any resulting agreement value will exclude recipient's "sunk" costs of prior research as cost match. Only additional resources that will be provided by the recipient to carry out the current project will be counted.  <br><br>SUBCONTRACTING PLAN:  Not applicable if proposing award under a non-FAR instrument (i.e. Technology Investment Agreement) or if the offeror is a SMALL BUSINESS CONCERN.  Pursuant to the requirements of FAR part 19.702(a)(1), if the total amount of the proposal exceeds $650,000, and there are subcontracting possibilities, offerors must submit a subcontracting plan.  FAR part 52.219-9 defines a subcontracting plan and its requirements.  Offerors shall incorporate the subcontracting plan as part of the offeror's proposal submission.  DFARS 226.370-8 discusses subcontracting incentive and goals with the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions.  DFARS 219.708(b)(1)(A) and (B), discusses the appropriate use of DFARS Clauses 252.219-7003 and 252.219-7004 in solicitations and contract related to small, small disadvantaged and women-owned small business subcontracting plans.  Offerors are cautioned that in solicitations where subcontracting opportunities exist, the Government will not execute a contract unless the Contracting Officer determines that the negotiated plan provides the maximum practicable opportunity for SBs, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, and Veteran-owned Small Business concerns or HBCUs/MIs to participate in the performance of the contract.  Offerors should note that DFARS 219.705-4 provides for a goal of 5% for SDB concerns and HBCUs/MIs.  <br><br>EVALUATION CRITERIA/BASIS FOR AWARD<br><br>Proposal Evaluation Criteria<br><br>The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of proposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effort) in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement.  Each proposal will receive an adjectival rating supported by narrative.  The ratings/narrative will be used to develop an order of merit listing for each topic.  Proposed cost/cost to the Government will be evaluated as appropriate, for realism and reasonableness.<br><br>The following evaluation criteria will apply: <br><br>	(1) Relevance of the Proposed Technologies.  This will include how the benefits of the constituent active and passive technologies as well as the benefits of the integrated rotor align with program objectives and the technology readiness timeline.<br><br>	(2) The Merit of the Proposed Technical Approach.  This includes understanding of the problem and current technical challenges to include at a minimum, the service environment and rotorcraft system constraints (space, weight, and power),  how the proposed solution addresses those challenges,  understanding of the current TRL level of the proposed technology,  integration approach to include an understanding of integration constraints, the reasonableness of the proposed tasks (to include the test and evaluation approach, concept tradeoffs, and design optimization), a clear and reasonable risk mitigation and demonstration plan, and credible schedule to accomplish the scientific and technical objectives and metrics.<br><br>       (3) Ability to Transition Technology. This includes the extent to which the technology will be available for follow-on system development to include at a minimum data rights, partnerships and teaming, capability to accomplish the technology transition to include the experience and qualifications of the proposed personnel, the suitability of the proposed facilities, and  the availability of (or the ability to generate) required technical and test data to validate the technology. <br><br> 	(4) The reasonableness of the proposed cost to the Government of the proposed tasks. This includes the realism of the proposed man-hours, materials and other costs to accomplish the proposed individual tasks and the overall effort. Any proposed cost share will be evaluated for its benefit in reducing program risk, achieving program objectives, and furthering the state-of-the-art.  This also includes the cost to Government of any required GFE/GFI or facilities.<br><br>Criteria (1), (2) are equal and more important than (3) which is more important than (4).<br><br>Upon notification by the Government, offerors may request a debriefing.  The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content will vary to be consistent with the procedures set out in FAR 35.016 governing BAAs.   <br><br>This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs.  No pre-proposal conference is to be held.   Proposal will be considered valid for 210 days from the date that this announcement closes unless specifically stated otherwise.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<p><br />Basis for Award</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to the solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter's quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to make an award to the quoter with the highest technically rated quotation rather than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. Thus, to the extent that quoter's technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as equal, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.</p>
<p>Factor I, Technical Capabilities (a) Contract requirements: Quotations will be evaluated on the Quoter's ability to provide all of the contract requirements relating to lodging, meeting space, food and beverage, A/V equipment and support, business center requirements, and reporting requirements. Quotations must address the Quoter's ability to comply with the Americans with Disability Act (ADA) as it relates to lodging and meeting space. Quotations will be evaluated on the quality of the customer services provided and the quality of the facilities reflected in maintenance and upkeep of the facilities. Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter's ability to provide the required service on the dates requested for each of the three years. (b) Location: Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of Quoter to provide a centrally located facility with inexpensive transportation options to and from the airport, and local restaurants and other area attractions within a short walking distance (10 minutes or less) of the proposed facility in the cities specified. Quotations must address safety and security issues both within the hotel complex and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Factor II, Past Performance (a) The quoter must provide references for at least three (3) government or non-government contracts which provide the same or similar services; contracts must have been awarded within the past three (3) years. Contact information should include the following: Name and address of government agency or other nongovernment client; Name, title, email and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; name, title, email and telephone number of client's program manager, if applicable; contract number, period of performance, and total dollar value of contract; and, description of services provided. List any problems encountered on each contract and the quoter's corrective actions. EEOC will evaluate past performance based on timeliness, customer service, and corrective actions taken (if necessary). (b) In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase nor decrease the overall rating.</p>
<p>Factor III, Price: The government will evaluate price quotations submitted in comparison to the Independent Government Cost Estimate. <br /><br />Site Visit: The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable. The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities Portion of the technical evaluation factors.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Options</p>
<p>Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best <br />interests, the Government will evaluate quotations for award purposes by adding the total price for all <br />options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the <br />Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the quoter's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government also reserves the right to conduct a site visit prior to award. The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The provisions at 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The vendor shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with your quote. The vendor shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.222-52 Exemption from the Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services- Certification with your quote.

Illumination Range at night --No-glow Covert Infrared up to 50 feet  ****Important ? Due to use on endangered species nesting platforms ?low-glow? red light technology for night images is unacceptable***
Focal Distance --  adjustable  ****Important ? Most motion sense cameras are designed for big game with a focal length of 10ft to infinity ?We need a camera that takes images in focus in a 1 to 1.5 foot area.
*Time-Lapse Surveillance  -- any combination of min, sec, and hours
*Time-Lapse Scheduling ? 15 minute increments within all 24hr  periods
*Motion Sensor Scheduling --15 minute increments within all 24hr  periods
*The two above listed functions need to be able to be turned on at the same time.  Most cameras can either be set for time-lapse or be set for motion sensing but cannot be combined.  Our project needs the capability of both to be programmed at the same time?i.e. set the camera for time lapse photo once every 30 seconds, but if motion it triggered in the interim photos will also be taken.

Other specifications:
Frame Rate ? programmable 0-60 seconds between images 
InstaOnTM Trigger Speed (motion sensitivity)  --  1/5 second  or faster
Photos per Trigger ? Programmable 1-99
SD Card Capacity ? 32 GB

Moisture Absorbing Desiccant System -- Yes

Time-Lapse Surveillance -- Virtually any number of seconds, min, or hours 

Motion Sensor Scheduling --15 minute increments within all 24 hour periods (or less)

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --<br><br>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals (  ) are, (  ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,<br><br>(2) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and <br><br>(3) (  ) are, (  ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br><br>(4) (  ) Have, (  ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br><br>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br><br>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br><br>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br><br>(ii) Examples. <br><br>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br><br>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br><br>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br><br>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br><br><br>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br><br>(1) Listed end products.<br><br><br>Listed End Product<br>Listed Countriesof Origin<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>(2) Certification.

<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>

<p>(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)<br><br>Question (Q) The modification on January 27th states all towers are self-supporting however the modification on January 30th mentions a Rohn 80 atop Mount Washington. <br>The Rohn 80 is a guyed tower, please clarify. <br><br>Answer(A) The Rohn 80 is at Pease, but we are verifying that actual type.<br><br>(Q) Can you provide a full list of tower sites to include specific heights, locations, and accessibility? <br><br>(A) We already provided the list of sites.  We don't have the specific heights but should be a maximum of 180 feet tall. All are accessible by 4 wheel drive vehicle, but will require coordination with us to be able to unlock gates. <br><br>(Q) Will we be restricted in the order or timeframe to conduct tower inspections? <br><br>(A)Yes, they have to happen in order that we get approval, and would need to be within a reasonable timeframe after request.<br><br>(Q)We are assuming the inspection will be TIA 222 REV G standards, is this correct? <br><br>(A)Yes<br><br>(Q)You mentioned requiring approval from tower owners for "placement", what does this refer to and how will it impact inspection ability.  <br><br>(A) We have to request locations for dishes.  The analysis cannot be performed until we know the exact location of the dishes.  I'm assuming site visits and details could be recorded prior to knowing the dish placement, but the full analysis cannot be performed until we have the final approved locations.<br><br>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br /><br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis makes 7 amendments:<br><br>1) Change in contract type: It is anticipated that the AFM Contract will be a definite delivery, definite quantity type contract. <br><br>2) Change in solicitation number: Due to the change of contract type, the solicitation number is no longer W58RGZ-11-R-0232. The new solicitation number is W58RGZ-12-R-0102. Fed Biz Opps data previously posted can still be referenced under W58RGZ-11-R-0232.

<p>Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition</p>
<p>1. This document constitutes justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the acquisition described herein, under the authority of FAR 6.302-2. It is executed on behalf of the 174th FW Civil Engineering Section.</p>
<p>2. The 174 FW proposes to procure by means of other than full and open competition Emergency Teardown and quote on various HVAC and Sprinkler repairs.</p>
<p>3. The Service is at a cost of $3,500<br /><br />4. Identification of statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>a. FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency.</p>
<p>b. 15 USC 637</p>
<p>5. Demonstrate that the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.</p>
<p>This procurement is for various buildings on base HVAC and Sprinkler repairs Tear Down and Quote. On 17 January 2012 several buildings fire alarms were going off and the sprinkler systems were inoperable due to a power loss on base. Davis-Ulmer was called and they came in and evaluated the system. Initial tests were done and the problem has been fixed. It has been decided that they would need to do a tear down and quote on the system. It would cost a substantial amount and delay the repair to compete this project. Davis-Ulmer also has the familiarity with the system at the 174th as they have responded to several other repairs as well. All prices are deemed fair and reasonable current wage determinations were used.</p>
<p><br />CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFICATION</p>
<p>I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.  Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) for Other Than Full and Open Competition is executed by the Acquisition Service Frederick, Frederick, MD.

2.  Nature/Description of Action.

This activity proposes to negotiate a noncompetitive award (sole source) with Gonzales McCaulley Investment Group, Inc. (a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business), for the procurement of Electronic Contract Management System (eCMS) training for a period of performance of a 12 month base period with one 12 month option period.  

3.  Description of Supplies/Services.

The purpose of this requirement is to implement a robust and ongoing training program for all of its eCMS components.  eCMS' user community is made of a wide range of workforce. The VA Acquisition Workforce consists of VA employees across broad range of VA organizations to support acquisition life cycle (e.g., program, project manager, procurement analyst, contracting officers, contracting officer's representatives, and quality assurance officers).

This training shall include both new and existing capabilities for the broad range of VA organizations which support its acquisition life cycle.  As a part of the robust training there shall be a variety of training formats for a wide spread and diverse acquisition workforce. The training program shall be able to support, the VA acquisition workforce in acquiring, maintain and optimizing their VA systems skills through courses delivered via e-learning, classroom training and on-site across different VA organizations.  The robust training program shall also deliver training to specific acquisition roles as well as supports an acquisition workforce with a broad range of work schedules.

Therefore, the purpose of this requirement is to establish an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for eCMS training to be provided across VA.  There will be a minimum contract value of $300,000.00 and maximum award value of $2,800,000.00.  

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.
The statutory exception permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 41 USC 253(c)(5), Authorized or Required by Statute as implemented by FAR 6.302-5. The applicable statute is PL 109-461, Veterans First Contracting Program (codified at 38 U.S.C.  8127 and 8128).

5.  Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications.

Gonzales McCaulley Investment Group, Inc. (GMIG) is a registered and verified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.  GMIG has experience and knowledge in developing and providing federal acquisition training, including COTR training to VA.

6.  Description of efforts made to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable.

Not applicable per VAAR 819.7007(b). The Contracting Officer's determination whether to make a sole source award is a business decision wholly within the discretion of the contracting officer. A determination that only one SDVOSB concern is available to meet the requirement is not required.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Prices.

No award shall be made until the Contracting Officer determines the costs to the Government to be fair and reasonable.  This determination will be based on sources such as comparison of other contracts' for same or similar services, the contractor's public price list, Internet Search Engines and Gonzales McCaulley Investment Group, Inc.'s quote.

8.  Description of Market Survey.

Market research was conducted using VetBiz.gov.  Gonzales McCaulley Investment Group, Inc. is a responsible source with respect to this contracting opportunity.  They are registered and certified in VetBiz.gov as a SDVOSB with the NAICS code for this requirement which in accordance with Public Law 109-461 Section 502(c) meets the requirements of this statute to sole source to a SDVOSB.

9.  Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.

PL109-461 Section 502(c) states:

SOLE SOURCE CONTRACTS FOR CONTRACTS ABOVE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION THRESHOLD.  For purposes of meeting the goals under subsection (a), and in accordance with this section, a contracting officer of the Department may award a contract to a small business concern owned and controlled by veterans using procedures other than competitive procedures if:

(1)	Such concern is determined to be a responsible source with respect to performance of such contract opportunity;
(2)	The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 4 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 403)) but will not exceed $5,000,000; and
(3)	In the estimation of the contracting officer, the contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.

This procurement meets all of these conditions.

10.  Listing of Interested Sources.

Gonzales McCaulley Investment Group, Inc.  
2764 Trudeau Lane 
Palmdale, CA 93551

11.  Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition.

All future requirements will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
