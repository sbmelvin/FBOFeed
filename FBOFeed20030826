<DESC>NA INDEFINITE DELIVERY CONTRACT FOR ONE YEAR AND TWO ONE YEAR OPTIONS TO CONDUCT BIOLOGICAL SERVICES WITHIN THE MEMPHIS DISTRICT BOUNDARIES OR ASSIGNMENTS OF THE MEMPHIS DISTRICT. Corps maintenance and construction activities are ongoing in various watersheds within the Memphis District boundaries and include areas where threatened or endangered (T&E) species are known to occur.  These include the White River, the St. Francis River Basin, and other areas within the boundaries of the six states assigned to the Memphis District.  The Memphis District or its Contractor may also perform work related to endangered mussel populations in other localities outside the Memphis District boundar ies.   General Scope of Services:  The Contractor shall provide all personnel and equipment required to perform work that may include, but not be limited to, the following work items in accordance with specific task orders issued by the Contracting officer: a.  The Contractor shall, within 30 days after issuance of a task order, conduct surveys (qualitative and/or quantitative) in a manner agreed upon in each task order to determine the presence/absence of endangered mussels, provide density estimates of enda ngered mussels, translocate populations of endangered mussels, and provide other services that may be required by the Memphis District relating to endangered mussel populations.  Variables such as weather, flood events or other unforeseen circumstances may  delay implementation of work without penalty to the contractor.     		a-1.  Qualitative surveys will, at a minimum, survey all habitat types within the designated reach, and will allow sufficient time to ensure that all species inhabiting the reach have been identified.  		 		a-2.  Quantitative sampling will include a sufficient number of replicate samples to adequately estimate population densities of both T&E species and non-endangered mussels.  In streams with defined mussel beds, sampling will include establishing physica l limits of the bed.  The number of replicate samples required to adequately assess the densities and species composition will depend on the size of the bed.  These limits will be marked using a Global Positioning System (GPS) unit. 		a-3.  When translocating endangered mussels, sufficient personnel will be present to collect the required numbers of the target species from the reach.  Techniques employed will ensure maximum coverage of the substrate.  For example, personnel may be dep loyed in a line perpendicular with the channel in such a manner as to have a six-inch overlap in their survey area.  In this manner, the entire substrate can be covered without gaps.  Specific requirements relating to translocation will be described in the  Biological Opinion supplied by the USFWS.  Translocation reports will include total number collected, mortalities (if any), GPS data on translocation sites, numbers placed at each site (if appropriate), the number of trips the contractor made to transport  the mussels, average time to transport the mussels, temperature of water, and average water depths.   b.	Written assessments for environmental impact statements, environmental assessments, and biological assessments or other project documents. c.	Preparation of technical reports containing results of work items accomplished under this contract. d.	Study areas under this contract will be primarily within the limits of the Memphis District boundaries; however some work items may occur in other locations.  Specific project study areas will be stipulated in individual task orders. All contract performance shall be in strict accordance with the Scope of Services and Department of Labor Wage Determination Numbers 1994-2033(REV 26), 1994-2035 (REV 19),1994-2295 (REV 20), 1994-2309 (REV 27), 1994-2311 (REV 21) and 1994-2495 (REV 22).  E xpected Service Start Date:  01 November 2003  Technical Point of Contact:  Mark Smith - (901)544-0670.  This solicitation incorporates all o f the applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 01-15.  NAICS Code 541380.  SIC Code 8731.  This procurement will be set-aside 100% for small businesses.  See Note 1.  A Firm Fixed Priced Commercial Items Purchase Order, utilizing simplified acquisition procedures, will be used.  A quote should be delivered to the address above no later than 30 September 2003, 2:30 P.M.(CST).  Point of Contact is Verneda B. Joyner at (901)544-3616.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center (R&DC) supports the missions of the Coast Guard through research, development, test, and evaluation, to seek performance gap solutions that are based on scientific and technologic advances.  The R&DC maintains contract services to provide for administrative/technical support to project, management, and administrative support activities.  This requirement is a follow-on requirement to an existing directed 8(a)contract. The current contract will run out of ceiling in FY04.  The administrative/technical support requirements cover a broad range of tasks.  They include such areas as informational services, technical writing/editing, creating presentations, position papers and graphics, conference meeting scheduling, logistics and facilitation, library/file management services, Internet/intranet support, office automation, project planning, studies, research, technology investigation and analysis and engineering, scientific, information technology and business support.  In the past, R&DC has allowed Coast Guard Headquarters and other Coast Guard organizations to use the administrative/technical support contract. In March of 2003, the Coast Guard “moved” as an organization from the Department of Transportation to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  That move expands the potential for non-R&DC sources of tasking under this procurement.  It is anticipated that this procurement will result in the award of an Award Term Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Performance Based Service Contract (PBSC) with provisions for placing Time and Material task orders.  Performance requirements will be included as part of the Statement of Work.  It is anticipated that this Award Term contract will be awarded with a base period of performance of three years.  The award term provision will allow the awardee to earn up to seven additional years of term conditioned on contractor performance in accordance with an Award Term Plan.    The contract requirement includes access to classified materials up to the SECRET level. The NAICS code is 541990 and the size standard is 5.0 million.  This procurement is set aside for competition under the Small Business Association’s 8(a) Program.  Proposals will only be accepted from 8(a) companies.  Offers will be evaluated on the basis of best value.  Award will be made to the responsive and responsible 8(a) offeror who provides the greatest overall value to the Government based on the technical proposal, cost and other factors.  For information concerning this solicitation please contact the contracting official cited below.  The USCG Research and Development Center Contracting Office does not issue solicitations in paper form.  Solicitations may be accessed on an electronic posting system at the following website:  http://www.eps.gov.

<CONTACT>Chris Ganey, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-4379, Fax 301-443-3849, Email cganey2@psc.gov
<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), (DHHS) through the Program Support Center has a nine  (9) month simplified acqusition procurement described as follows: 

The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) was established with the 1992 ADAMHA Reorganization Act (Public law 102-321).  Congress created SAMHSA/ CMHS to bring new hope to adults who have severe mental illnesses and to children with serious emotional disturbances.  SAMHSA/CMHS leads Federal efforts to promote mental health and prevent the development or worsening of mental illnesses whenever possible.   

The people most affected by the work of SAMHSA/CMHS’ Special Programs Development Branch (SPDB) include some of the Nation’s most under-served and at-risk populations such as racial/ethnic minorities, women, and young children, adolescents, and their families.  The Branch’s programs focus on special and emerging mental health issues for individuals and their families.  

Three major grant programs are under the Special Programs Development Branch’s (SPDB’s) broad domain to Promote Mental Health and Prevent Mental and Behavioral Disorders.  Of these, the largest grant program is the interdepartmental Safe Schools/Healthy Students (SS/HS) School Violence Prevention Initiative designed to prevent school violence and promote healthy child and adolescent development.  This initiative is administered collaboratively by the Departments of Justice (DOJ), Education (DoED), and Health and Human Development(DHHS). SPDB has the lead for DHHS.

Since the beginning of the Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative, SPDB understood the significant challenges facing school districts as they implemented a complex grant program requiring the integration of educational, mental health and law strategies into a comprehensive program. 

Formalized technical assistance that could complement the efforts of Government Project Officers from the three agencies was identified as an important component of the school violence prevention initiative. A grant announcement was release in 1999 that called for the creation of a technical assistance center to provide substantive guidance and interpersonal support to the Safe Schools/Healthy Students (SS/HS) grantees. A wide range of technical assistance (TA) issues were to be addresses such as: (a) helping community coalitions remain strong, (b) brokering national expert to visit sites, (c) creating a customized technical assistance plan for each site through a collaborative process, and (d) helping the grantee develop strategies to sustain important aspects of their grant program after Federal funds end.


The National Mental Health Association in partnership with the National Association of School Psychologist was awarded the technical assistgance grant in September, 1999. The TA center became know as the Safe Schools/Healthy Students Action Center (Action Center).

A recent focus of the Action Center’s work has been on the issue of sustaining community programs and services after Federal financial assistance ends. The Action Center recognizes that not only must the grantee address the complex issues of reducing youth violence, but they must make an heroic effort to affect the culture of the school and change the ongoing governance and policy structures that can support and sustain reform.  All of this information and work in the area of sustaining resources after Federal dollars leave, needs to be organized and packaged in such a way that it can be shared with all of the SS/HS grantees and other CMHS Grantees as well.  This contract provides NMHA with the resources to compile this information and create a Tool Kit, and summary report that can be shared beyond the boundaries of SS/HS.  The Took is to include but not limited to the following topics:  effective governance, change agency functions, leadership, institutionalized mechanism, capacity building, public/private partnerships and accountability, a description of the process of TA with a discussion of lessons learn about all issues related to sustainability 

This project supports SAMHSA’s Science to Service Initiative in the SAMHSA Priority Area: Prevention  & Early Intervention.  It embodies SAMHSA’s Cross-Cutting Principle of collaboration with public and private partners.  It offers an excellent opportunity to provide grantees with state of the art information on how to sustain grant programs and build an enhanced network of resources for children and youth. 


The goal of this project is to package the lessons learned that the Action Center has gained as the TA provider for the SS/HS grantees in cohort one and two with special emphasis on issues of sustainability.  How to sustain a school/community program that stated out with Federal funding remains a challenge  for every new SS/HS grantees and other CMHS grantees as well. The primary product is to be a marketable tool kit that could be used by future grantees and government project officers.

All firms interested in being considered for this potential acquisition shall submit a written request for a copy of the solicitation to the above address by 3:00 PM  EST July 29, 2003. 
E-mail and fax are accepted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Control and Populations Sciences (DCCPS), Statistical Research and Applications Branch (SRAB), intends on entering into a sole source contract with the University of California at San Diego, 1545 Hotel Circle South, Suite 310, San Diego, CA 92108 to continue support of the consortium of simulation modeling groups, which began the important task of building simulation models to study the impact of cancer control interventions on population and future trends as well as optimal cancer controls strategies in September of 2000.  The Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET)is a diverse group involving members from over a dozen different organizations at multiple sites around the world.  The CISNET consortium includes five grantees focusing on medeling for lung cancer.  An advantage of having a consortium of modelers is the ability to employ a comparative modeling approach.  While each modeler has areas of an individual focus, common "base" questions have developed that allow for comparisons across models.  The motivation is that sometimes widely different results from models are often difficult to resolve, and this provides a chance to reach a common consensus on important questions, and to better understand differences between models.  Sets of common population inputs are used across all models (e.g., dissemination patterns of screening and treatment, mortality from non-cancer causes), and a common set of intermediate and final outputs are developed to help understand differences and similarities across models.  While cigarette smoking is generally assumed to have had a substantial impact on lung cancer, there are certain aspects of modeling this impact which are still a major challenge, e.g., gaining a better understanding of the process of carcinogenesis for those who have quite smoking, understanding the role of changing tobacco products on population trends, and understanding trends in lung cancer among nonsmokers.  The NCI has determined that, in order for these concerns to be properly addressed, it is cruicial to first obtain high-quality estimates of smoking initiation and cessation rates for the various gender and birth cohorts that comprise the US population over the period of interest.  The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a national-level survey, administered yearly, which asked respondents about their cigarette smoking habits since 1968.  A previous analysis by Burns et al.demonstrated that multiple NHIS survey data sets, spanning the period 1968-1991, could be combined in order to produce gender-specific estimates of smoking initiation and cessation rates for "synthetic" 5-year birth cohorts.  The goal of the NCI is to update the Burn's analysis to include more recent years of the NHIS survey data (1992-2000). The University of California at San Diego is the only source known to the government that can provide the ncessary personnel, expertise to perform the above required services/data.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the required services/information, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EDT on September 16, 2003.  This acquisition will be make pursuant to the authortiy in FAR 13 to use simplified acquisition procedures. The NAICS Code is 541690.

<DESC>Subject to final approval, the Inter-American Foundation, through Bureau of the Public Debt, intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis, a contract with Inter-American Dialogue, 1211 Connecticut Avenue, Suite 510, Washington DC  20036, to procure services to organize and implement a regional workshop that will present effective practices in socio-economic development within communities of African descent and conduct training on implementing local development partnerships.  As a member of the Inter-Agency Consultation on Race in Latin America (IAC), the Inter-American Foundation is actively involved in promoting greater awareness of the particular issues facing communities of African descent in the region.  The IAC conducts conferences and workshops every year, sponsored by different IAC members.   In 2000, the World Bank sponsored the annual IAC conference; in 2001, the Inter-American Development Bank sponsored the annual IAC conference; and in 2002, the Pan American Health Organization sponsored the annual IAC conference.  The IAF has agreed to sponsor the annual conference by convening a workshop in Honduras that will promote the integration of civil society organizations of African descent throughout the Hemisphere with various stakeholders (ie. development organizations and the local private and public sector).  The IAC expects other member agencies to contribute towards the costs of the workshop, as members have done with past conferences.  It is an avenue for the IAF to provide essential training and networking opportunities.  The objectives of the workshop are as follows: 1) Draw attention to the successes as well as the challenges of implementing local development partnerships that emphasize: economic development, citizen participation or municipal partnerships (the participant profile will emphasize the involvement of grassroots organizations that would most benefit from training) 2) Provide training on implementing local development partnerships 3) Create an opportunity for increasing channels of communication among civil society, private sector, local and national governments and with officials from participating institutions of the IAC. The Contractor shall support the IAF in its efforts to provide training to communities of African descent.  The contractor shall organize and implement the regional workshop and procure a suitable location for its activities.  The workshop will be structured as trainer-facilitated group sessions and plenary sessions that will include panels and presentations.  This format should allow participants to be actively engaged and learn from each other’s experiences.  Site visits to local projects and opportunities for networking among various stakeholders will be included in the agenda.  The contractor shall perform the following tasks:  1) Organize and implement a 3-day workshop in February 2004 in Central America, preferably Honduras 2) Identify and procure conference site for 100 participants 3) Convene a steering committee of Afro-descendent leaders and IAF to develop the agenda for the workshop and criteria for conference participation, disseminate information on the workshop to generate participation, set up a workshop registration form via Internet, review applications, select participants, and handle other relevant logistics 4) Procure qualified trainers and facilitators 5) Identify organizations and projects for local site visits 6) Communicate regularly with key stakeholders in the United States and Latin America (i.e. other IAC members, Afro-descendent leaders) and other interested parties (i.e. academics, Congressional Black Caucus) about workshop progress and solicit their feedback regarding agenda and participation 7) Arrange for publicity and high-level participation from government and business leaders from the region 8) Provide logistical support; Serve as lead contact for all travel coordination and logistics, invitations and troubleshooting; Disseminate workshop results and proceedings: coordinate materials, prepare conference reports suitable for publication and organize audio visual equipment.   The following deliverables are required under this contract: 1) A work plan approved by the IAF Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR), due within 15 days of the contract award 2) Monthly updates to steering committee: this may include meetings, conference calls and other electronic correspondence 3) The establishment of criteria to be utilized for the selection of trainers and facilitators 4) The creation and implementation of promotional materials to disseminate about the workshop, an application process to be utilized for the selection of workshop participants from throughout the region, a website to accept applications and disseminate workshop results 5) A workshop agenda  6) The procurement of a conference site suitable for 100 participants 7) A workshop report suitable for publication that will be disseminated among the IAC audience, i.e., Latin American NGOs, government officials, development practitioners and officials of IAC member organizations.   It should include recommendations for the format and methodology of a similar workshop to be held in South America in 2005.  Firms must submit a description of their capabilities in sufficient technical detail to substantiate the ability of any alternative source who can meet all these requirements.   If no affirmative written response is received by 2 PM EDT on Monday, September 8, 2003, to the effect that a comparable contractor is available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining the services through the proposed contractor, a sole-source award will be made.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.*****

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service, Northeast Fisheries Science Center is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with the Fisheries and Marine Institute Memorial University of Newfoundland to detail and develop designs for three trawls: a Yankee 36 roller net, a Winter flat net, and a NEFSC shrimp trawl used on Northeast Fisheries Science Center resource surveys.  Detailing will involve sampling and measuring all net components from Government-supplied examples of nets, and development of rigging profile drawings, net plans, footgear drawings, equipment checklists, and components lists for each Government supplied trawl net.  Resulting net diagrams and documents must meet standards outlined by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) outlined in the Report of the Study Group on Net Drawing and the NOAA Fisheries Trawl Survey Protocols.  These standards include detailed drawings of net sections and panels including mesh sizes and counts, knot construction, tapers, selvedges, framing ropes, and detailed descriptions and CAD drawings of trawl wires and hardware. Due to a high level of visibility, NEFSC requires development of documentation that allows for little or no bias or variance pertaining to the calibration and standardization of the survey trawl.  The Fisheries and Marine Institute at Memorial University is uniquely qualified to provide the required services as they have consistently maintained international leadership in the area of fishing gear standardization.  The Institute maintains electronic CAD drawings of most hardware and net mesh used in commercial and research fishing operations.  They have extensive experience with detailing and developing net designs for trawl and other fishing gear used in Canadian and some U.S. research programs.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to respond to the requirement by September 10, 2003.  Written requests may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Telephone requests will not be accepted. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>Provide a prototype that can immerse up to 3 Soldiers in a single virtual reality simulator for Special Operating Forces training in active reconnaissance in the search of high value targets and critical priority intelligence requirements to include WMD equipment and facilities. The system is desired to have as wide a field of view as possible; minimum desired is 270 degrees in vertical and horizontal with 360 degrees being the goal.  The immersed Soldiers must be able to observe specific terrain areas, identify targets, use devices like binoculars, scopes, & Night Vision Goggles, perform day and night operations, and eventually maneuver in the system and engage reactive targets as required.

The working prototype will also have internal devices that replicate PRC-137F HF and DAMA satellite terminals operating in duplex mode.  Message traffic will flow to and from the tender’s station and the transceiver mock-ups within the simulator. 

It is desired to be able to generate geo-specific databases that can be visualized in the immersive environment and used for OneSAF.  Database must be generated within 24 hours of receiving NIMA and other imagery data.  3 initial databases with variable scenarios will be developed to demonstrate the technology (Prisoner of War camp, Weapons of Mass Destruction, and Command and Control Nodes).

The immersive system must be capable of ingesting the 3D visualization databases, networking with OneSAF Testbed Baseline (OTB) to generate the targets, and displaying high resolution targetry.  System must be capable of displaying numerous types of OTB entities simultaneously to include individuals, moving and static vehicles and aircrafts, and weapons fire.

A phased approach to this prototype is sought.

PHASE I. The phase I effort will consist of a prototype to allow a three man team to perform stationary reconnaissance training mission. At least one database must be developed during this phase. Concepts and implementation of the processes to develop these databases will be worked during this phase. The prototype must perform, at a minimum, day operations and as a goal night operations. The system will allow the soldiers to observe specific terrain areas and clearly identify targets with specific markings through the use of devices like binoculars, scopes, & Night Vision Goggles.  A minimum field of view for this system will be greater than 180 degrees in the horizontal and 135 degrees in the vertical.  Some high fidelity targets will be available for viewing in the system.  A demonstration will be conducted at the US Army’s Simulation Technology Center in Orlando, FL or at Ft Bragg, NC.

Phase 1 will be a 1 year effort and funding may consist of approximately $500,000.

Future Phases: Development will continue of the requirements described in Phase I to achieve the desired results.  Follow-on phases will incorporate the technologies developed in preceding phases.  Each future phase will consist of 1 year of effort and approximately $500,000. The end product will consist of a prototype simulator installed at Ft Bragg, NC and or Macdill AFB, FL for demonstrations and evaluations.

PHASE II.  The prototype will add the functionality of allowing the immersed Soldiers to engage targets and be engaged by target. A sniper rifle and M4 rifle will be available to engage the targets. Day and night operations are required for this phase. The ability to laze targets is required. A second database will be developed and the tools for creating future databases within 24 hours will be completed. The field of view of the system will be increased to 270 degrees in the horizontal and 180 degrees in the vertical.  Additional high fidelity targets will be added.  A demonstration will be conducted at the US Army’s Simulation Technology Center in Orlando, FL or at Ft Bragg, NC.

PHASE III. The ability for the Soldier to maneuver through the environment will be added. The database will now be dynamic and not stationary.  All night and zoom devices will be available in the system to identify and engage targets.  Additional weapons may be added to the system. The third database will be developed using the processes developed in Phase II. The field of view will be increased to 270 degrees in the horizontal. Additional high fidelity targets may be added to the system.  The prototype system will be installed and demonstrated at Ft Bragg, NC and or Macdill AFB, FL.

There will be at least 2 mandatory formal technical interchange meetings during Phase 1.  
This announcement constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal request-for-proposal or other solicitation regarding this Notice be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to republish the technical description of the announcement in order to provide a more detailed description of the technology being researched.   The technical description is replaced as follows:  Air Force Research Laboratory Rome Research Site (AFRL RRS) is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase AFRL’s knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required in support of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) of warfighting techniques, equipment and capabilities. Solutions to transitional research and engineering using innovative approaches will be sought.  The scope of this effort primarily focuses on supporting the mission [Produce Integrated, Predictive Air and Space Intelligence to Enable Military Operations, Force Modernization and Policymaking] of the National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NAIC) located at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, OH.  White papers in the area of Modeling and Simulation science, as applied to: Air and Space Systems [e.g. Terrestrial/Space Communications Network Modeling Tools, etc.], Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Space-Based Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (SBISR) sensors are requested.  This BAA covers a broad range of requirements/topics which specifically include, but are not limited to: improved real-time decision-making (advanced information visualization/animation and data integration tools); spectral library (adaptive signature generation) development for paint degradation and seasonal vegetation change spectral libraries, etc.); predictive assessments [Unorthodox High Speed Propulsion Performance Analysis Tools (e.g. Pulsed Detonation Model, Air Turbo Rocket Model, Turbo-Ramjet Model and SCRAM Jet Model, etc.)]; Hard and Deeply Buried Target (HDBT/WMD-WME) Detection [using MASINT, Hyperspectral (HSI), SAR, SLAR, thermal, spectral, terrain map comparison analysis technologies (e.g. LANDSAT data), airborne / space technologies development, etc.] for detection/visualization of Underground Facilities (UGF)/HDBTs.  Also areas covering:  Radio Frequency (RF) Weapons and Laser Weapons Modeling, Advanced Analysis Capabilities for Integrated Avionics Systems/Suites, Missile System Threat Analysis Tools (Booster and Post Boost Upgrades); and Information In Warfare (IIW) are also required.  Ideas on theoretical foundations of decision science/environments: modeling of cognitive processes; Centers Of Gravity (COG) analysis; Courses Of Action (COA) analysis; Effects Based Operations (EBO); Situation Assessment (SA); Predictive Battlespace Awareness (PBA); Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace (IPB); Battlespace Production (BP) Technique/Objective(s) Models; Common Operational Picture (COP); Information Operations (IO) / Information Warfare (IW); etc. are also requested.  AFRL RRS requires solutions sufficient to meet the needs of the Air Force in particular the:   National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NAIC), Air Force Information Warfare Center (AFIWC), Air Intelligence Agency (AIA), Air Combat Command (ACC), Joint Warfare Analysis Center (JWAC), and Air Force Battle Labs, etc.  Some general areas of interest are: modeling cognitive processes, real-time decision making, M&S in distributed mission training, information visualization/animation, M&S for war-gaming/"pre-planning"/exercise rehearsal support, and specific Air and Space Systems Intelligence Mission Applications (IMA). Emphasis is placed on immediate technology transfer/technology insertion of mature technologies (capable of being directly transitioned with minimal R&D enhancement rework) into Air Force operational environments which directly support the war fighter.  All other details of the original announcement starting from, "THIS ANNOUCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION…" remains the same.  Questions prior to the submission of a proposal can continue to be addressed to the technical POC's, Donald J. Gondek, Program Manager, Phone (315) 330-3678, E-Mail: Donald.Gondek@rl.af.mil or Kenneth J. Sherman, Program Manager, Phone (315) 330-7198, E-Mail: Kenneth.Sherman@rl.af.mil.

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation is hereby amended to incorporate all questions and answers made up to August 25, 2003.

Acknowledge receipt of amendment in each copy of your proposal. 

Question: How does the proposed USDA system relate to the FFS-MIS?
Answer: Currently there are no plans to integrate the proposed system with FFS-MIS. However data from these systems may be exchanged in the future.

Question: The FFS-MIS requirements are incomplete. What is the process for establishing complete requirements for the USDA system? 
Answer: The requirements for the USDA system should be contained in the RFP.

Question: Does data model for the proposed system exist?
Answer: The Data model for this system will be the model used by the COTS application. The FLPIDS data model is currently being developed and the COTS application will need to supply data to the FLPIDS data store. There may be data elements identified by the USDA that need to be added to the COTS application data model.

Question: What are the types of users of the system? How many of each user? Can you tell us the number of users for each of the following groups who will be using the software product in this Solicitation: Management, Technical Users, End Users?
Answer: Approximately 1800 USDA employee’s at Service Centers, State and National levels, and potentially 100,000 customers.

Question: What are the security requirements?
Answer: Security requirements are stated in the Statement of Work in Section 3.9.

Question: Could you provide a use case to describe how the legacy FHP system is used today?
Answer: Not at this time.

Question: If this RFP is not a small business set-aside, why is there a not to exceed $21m size standard?  
Does the $21,000,000 mean the bid shall not exceed this amount or is it a small business requirement that Contractor assets do not exceed this amount to be eligible to respond to the solicitation?
Answer: A small business code and standard is required for all contracts regardless of whether or not we set-aside any portion of the contract specifically for small business. This code and standard applies only to small businesses; it does not refer to bid amounts.

Question: Addendum 3, 3.7, pg. 14 of 46 - Is the contractor to provide the supporting documentation in the RFP response, at the time of the TD or upon contract award?
Answer: Upon contract award. However, in Addendum 6 - General Instructions to Vendors it states that "two complete sets of user and operations documentation in hard copy form pertaining to all software being proposed" be submitted. It also states in the same section that "Additional technical information, equipment specifications, operating documentation of a detailed nature, and similar material not specifically requested, may be submitted as appendices to the proposal at the Vendor's option."

Question: Addendum 3, 3.7.2 and 3.7.4, pg. 15 of 46 - The Contractor understands the following interfacing responsibilities to be true: 
FSA: Exports data from existing DB2 Operational Database in COTS ASCII Delimited format.
Contractor: Imports FSA ASCII Delimited data into the COTS system.
Contractor: Exports FSA-specific data fields from COTS in XML format.
FSA: Imports COTS XML data into DB2 Operational Database.
If this information is not true, the Contractor must have all applicable interfacing requirements provided ASAP for effective bidding of project.
Answer: The example given is correct. There may also be scenarios where the FSA provides XML data to the Contractor and the Contractor imports FSA XML data into the COTS system.

Question: Addendum 3, 3.7.5, pg. 15 of 46 - Training for all COTS users in FSA county offices nationwide is not addressed.  Where should the Contractor address a bid for this training, i.e., include as an addendum to the RFP response, bid it as a multiple offer or award under 52.212-1 items (e – pg. 28 of 46) or (h – pg. 29 of 46)?
Answer: Training requirements have been identified in Addendum 3 - Statement of Work, in the RFP. Training for the FSA county offices is not required, but may be submitted as an addendum.

Question: Addendum 8, 8.0.1, pg. 39 of 46 - Is the Contractor to provide hardware (server) for testing and production operations?  Or is FSA providing hardware for the test demonstration and production operations at NITC or the FSA Web Farm?
Answer: FSA will provide the hardware for acceptance testing and the production system. We will need information from the Contractor on recommended sizing go the server. 

Question: Addendum 8, 8.0.5a, pg. 40 of 46 - States offerors will receive test cases 10 days before the scheduled TD date. Addendum 6, 6.1.4 (pg. 32 of 46) states offerors will receive test cases 5 days prior to presentation. Which is correct?
Answer: 10 days.

Question: Addendum 6, 6.0.2, pg. 32 of 46 - Refers to Section B for format and instructions for total estimated costs.  There is no Section B.  Should the reference be to Section 2 - Schedule of Supplies/Services (CLIN List -- Pg. 10 of 46)?
Answer: References to Section B should be revised to state "Addendum 2 - Schedule"

Question: Addendum 6, 6.2.a, pg. 33 of 46 - The evaluation factor table shows a total of 100 technical points. Ratings further down in the paragraph refer to 1000 technical points. Which is correct?
Answer: The total number of Technical Points available is 100, NOT 1000. The ratings should now reflect the following: Outstanding = 90-100% (90-100 points); Exceeds Acceptable = 80-89% (80-89 points); Acceptable = 70-79% (70-79 points); Unacceptable = 0-69% (0-69 points).

Question: Addendum 7, Performance Questionnaire, pg. 36 of 46 - The date in paragraph two indicates this is to be filled out and returned via email no later than 08-23-2003.  According to the solicitation modification released on 08-19-2003, however, the proposal due date is 08-29-2003.  Does the PQ due date need to be adjusted?
Answer: The Performance Questionnaires are due by August 29, 2003.

Question: There is a reference to the GSA Schedule in the RFP, is this procurement being solicited via the GSA Schedule, if so, which one, and does the software and support services need to be available on the GSA Schedule?
Answer: This procurement is not being solicited solely from the GSA Schedule. Addendum 6 merely states that if a contractor offers the same product under the GSA Schedule, then they should adhere to that format (i.e. use the same CLINs to identify that item.

Question: Has the RFP been issued to selected firms, if so, who, and if not, who has requested the RFP?
Answer: The RFP has not been issued to selected firms. An RFP has been issued to the following: Computer Science Corporation, ECI, SBC Global, Agrilogic, ABSS Inc., INPUT, Headstrong, Corporate Radar, MTC Integration, Masai-Tech, and Deloitte & Touche.

Question: Section 3.7 indicates the software must be installed at 2 or more customer sites, the evaluation criteria in Section 7.2.2 says it must be operational in 3 separate financial institutions. Please clarify. If we are proposing a new product that has been operational in a financial institution for over 90 days, does it have to be installed in multiple institutions?
Answer: The evaluation criteria in Section 7.2.2 is correct. The software must be installed, implemented, and operational at a minimum of three separate agricultural credit and or financial institutions. Yes, all proposed products must meet the mature product evaluation criteria detailed in Addendum 7.2.2 of FSA-R-25-03DC.

Question: Since USDA will have several hundred offices and lenders using this system is there a requirement for a demonstrated ability to support a very large number of lenders/loan offices using the system over the Web?
Answer: No.

Question: Section 3.7, please clarify that new and improved software releases are exempt from the requirement of being operational at three financial institutions? Would new products be exempt from this requirement as well.
Answer: This refers to new and improved software releases of an established product. No, all proposed products must meet the mature product evaluation criteria detailed in Addendum 7.2.2 of FSA-R-25-03DC.

Question: Clause 3.7.4 does recognize that no system will meet all of FSA’s requirements and that some customization to data base design, screens, algorithms, processes, interfaces, and conversion of data will be required. The RFP states that the time to complete this effort is 45 days. Would the USDA consider allowing vendors to propose alternate timeframes necessary to complete these tasks?
Answer: No, the timeframe for implementation of the production software is critical.

Question: Please clarify how is the contractor to be paid for the customization work. There is no provision in Schedule B (Addendum 2) for software customization and development.
Answer: Estimated costs for customization should be included in CLIN 0001. 

Question: There is no mention of the preferred architecture of the product, isn’t USDA moving to a Portal Based environment like all other agencies with eGov projects, and wouldn’t you prefer a Portal Based product with an open architecture?
Answer: We will use standard CCE hardware to support the package. From a software architecture standpoint a Portal Based environment is not necessary for this package. 

Question: Has the USDA reviewed documentation or seen a demonstration of a system that complies with the requirements of this RFP?
Answer: Yes, based on responses to the RFI.

Question: Will the USDA sign a commercial license for the software product, including a maintenance agreement?
Answer: Based on the requirements of this solicitation, it should be understood that an unlimited user license is required in the Offeror’s proposal. Maintenance is included under CLINs 0002, 0004, and 0005.

Question: Due to the fact that the USDA wasn’t able to upload the SOW to FBO, the USDA’s e-mail has been down due to viruses, and bidder’s didn’t receive the SOW until 8/21, we request that the USDA grant an extension of at least two weeks to receive answers to our questions and adequately prepare our proposal responses.
Answer: The FBO announcement was published on 8/14/03. Several vendors received the RFP on 8/15/03. Alternative methods of contact, i.e. phone and fax, were available during the e-mail problem (problems began on or about 8/20/03). An additional 2 weeks is not feasible. Extension denied.

Question: Would USDA consider holding a bidder’s conference so that we can have dialogue with USDA and ask additional questions?
Answer: No.

Question: Does the fact that a contractor’s current system would require significant amounts of customization preclude it from being considered? Can we bid if our solution requires some modification?
Answer: Not in and of itself. Some modifications will be necessary.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Top-Loading Helium-3 Cryostat
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-03-856-3263

<CONTACT>Lisa Sawyer, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-3840, Fax 301-975-2541, Email lisa.sawyer@nist.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this solicitation modification is to extend the response date to 07/24/03 by 3:00pm and to supply Questions & Answers - Part 1 pertaining to the solicitation.
Ref#03-856-3263.  All other information remains the same.
               ****Questions & Answers Part 1******
1)Question:	From the write up received in the solicitation, there is not enough information to determine the envelope that the cryostat is inserted into, and were wondering if there are any drawings that would add clarity to the requirement?

Answer:	The solicitation is for a complete cryogenic system that will mount onto a tilt/translate goniometer with the described bolt pattern.  NIST is not requesting a helium-3 insert to be placed in a helium-4 cryostat or storage dewar (which would not meet the specification forbidding liquid cryogens in the beam line).  
NIST did not provide specifications for the available space above the goniometer mount because typical offerings generally fit without problem on our targeted spectrometers.  However, as a guide the entire cryostat shall not exceed a diameter of 10 inches in the neutron beam path.  Above the neutron beam path, the cryostat shall be less than 24 inches in diameter.  The overall height shall be expected to be less than 6 feet in a running configuration, and NIST has ample overhead clearance for removing cryostat inserts etc.  None of these numbers are meant to be taken as inviolable requirements, but are merely given as guidelines.

2)Question:	I understand that the sample cannot be in He-3 liquid but must be in either vacuum and (static) exchange gas.  Please confirm?

Answer:	Yes, the sample shall be either vacuum or static exchange gas.  This is addressed in the performance specifications and in the neutron scattering requirements.  Liquid helium-3 produces too large a neutron scattering background signature, and is to be kept outside the beam area.

3)Question:	If this is the case, the base temperature of the sample may not be able to reach below 300 mK per our past experience, and we just have quote whatever performance specs we feel comfortable with.  Is that acceptable?

Answer:	Vendors are advised to quote the performance specifications that you are comfortable with.

4) Question:	The solicitation document states that minimum sample space diameter should be 50mm.  Samples for neutron scattering experiments are typically less than this so we just want to make certain of this specification?

Answer:	The specification of 50mm is correct.  Although samples are generally much smaller than this, many of our sample cans, which go between different types of sample environment equipment, require this diameter.  NIST does understand that this increases the required sample well diameter in the case of inserts with vacuum cans.
  
5) Question:	The solicitation does not specify any wiring down to the sample region.  Does NIST have any specific requirements in this regard that the vendor should know about?  Are there any instrumentation wiring requirements to the sample stage?

Answer:	There is no specification or requirement for user wiring down to the sample position.  There are no specific requirements for such user wiring, though provision for or inclusion of such may be seen as an added benefit above and beyond the base specifications.  The only relevant requirement beyond the ordinary cryogenic concerns is that the wiring would not extend into the neutron beam area.

Award shall be made to the offeror whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1)Technical Capability factors that adhere to the technical specifications, user-friendly temperature control, cryogen maintenance specification requirements.  User-friendly temperature control and cryogen maintenance requirements are inherently germane to the use of the system by NIST personnel. User-friendly temperature control that is easy to operate, either through simple and objective procedures or a uniform interface, shall be judged more highly. Additionally, Cryogen maintenance requirements refer to both the periodic need to refill liquid cryogens (nitrogen and helium) and the periodic need to recycle closed-loop cryogenic helium-3.  Systems that operate for longer periods between cryogen maintenance shall be judged more highly. 2) Past performance and 3) Price.  Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price. The selection factors for this RFQ are adherence to the technical specifications, user-friendly temperature control, cryogen maintenance requirements, past performance and price.*** 

Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Offerors shall include the make and model of the product, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which clearly documents that the offered product meets or exceeds the specifications stated above.  Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and/or information provided by NIST and its affiliates.  Offerors shall provide a list of at least THREE (3) REFERENCES to whom the same or similar products have been sold.  The list of references shall include, at a minimum: The name of the reference contact person and the company or organization; the telephone number of the reference contact person; the contract or grant number; the amount of the contract and the address and the telephone number of the Contracting Officer if applicable; and the date of delivery or the date services were completed. Past Performance shall be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product and service provided by the Contractor.  Offerors with no relevant past performance shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably. ***

<SUBJECT>A -- Scientific investigations of living donor liver transplantation using clinical information and tissue and blood samples from adult liver transplant recipients
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-DK-02-0151
<RESPDATE>072103

<DESC>Collaboration in scientific investigations of living donor liver transplantation using clinical information and tissue and blood samples from adult liver transplant recipients in the areas of cellular and genetic aspects of liver regeneration; liver function and metabolic mass;  markers of liver injury and repair; treatment of hepatitis C; hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer); immunosuppression and  immune tolerance; drug metabolism; gene expression; psychometric measures of quality of life; electronic media for patient education; and other scientific issues relevant to living donor liver transplantation.

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies) to investigate scientific issues in the recently formed Clinical Research Network termed Adult to Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort Study (A2ALL). The core theme of A2ALL is comparison of outcomes of candidates for liver transplant who receive or do not receive Living Donor Transplantation (LDT).  See http://www.nih-a2all.org/default.asp for more information and list of participating centers.  The potential Collaborator’s capability statement should provide proof of expertise in the design and implementation of studies of the relevant area of investigation and should include the scientific rationale for the study proposed, proposed methods, and access to potential therapeutic or diagnostic molecules. Examples of potential studies include: 1) Characterization of changes in LIVER FUNCTION, mass, and metabolic capacity during regeneration following liver transplantation. The impact of changing liver function on the immune response as well as its effect on metabolism of immunosuppressants could be investigated using novel biochemical and imaging techniques.  2) Identification of host GENETIC FACTORS associated with LIVER REGENERATION and the syndrome of graft failure due to inadequate liver mass.  This will require the identification of genes involved in successful liver regeneration in humans, as well as pathophysiologic events in the failure of grafts. 3) Assessment of the interrelationship of LDT with IMMUNOSUPPRESSION.  Cylosporine, tacrolimus, and other immunosuppressive drugs have been associated with proliferative effects which impact liver regeneration. In addition, changes in liver function affect the pharmacokinetics of most immunosuppression.  4) Exploration of serum markers for LIVER INJURY and repair to predict hepatic histology either by themselves or in combination with other clinical and laboratory variables.  Also, the utility of these serum markers as surrogate markers of therapeutic response in study subjects participating in treatment trials.  5) Evaluation of the impact of liver regeneration on the KINETICS OF VIRAL REPLICATION in subjects with HEPATITIS C, and the impact of INTERFERONS and other therapeutic molecules on these phenomena.  6)  Prevention of liver injury from recurrence of hepatitis C in LDT recipients by pre- and post-transplant TREATMENT OF HEPATITIS C.  7)  Improved staging and treatment of HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA.  8)  Develop GENE EXPRESSION ARRAYS that are diagnostic of liver regeneration and repair and would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, STEATOSIS AND FIBROSIS in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.  9)  Study novel approaches to tolerance induction in a defined cohort of patients being prepared for elective transplantation from living donors.  10) Study the process of INFORMED UNDERSTANDING of living liver donors using ELECTRONIC MEDIA EDUCATION technology to provide patient information and correlate understanding with outcomes.  11) Development of effective PSYCHOMETRIC INSTRUMENTS to evaluate the QUALITY OF LIFE effects of living donation in this cohort of patients who will be followed long term. 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  STUDY GOAL:  The overall goal of this study is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with LDT using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy patients undergoing liver transplantation and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by development of a structured, prospective database on patients who are evaluated for LDT and either undergo LDT or instead, for various reasons, receive cadaveric livers or do not undergo transplantation at all.  Blood and tissue samples will be collected from all donors and recipients at pre-determined time points.

<DESC>Collaboration in scientific investigations of living donor liver transplantation using clinical information and tissue and blood samples from adult liver transplant recipients in the areas of cellular and genetic aspects of liver regeneration; liver function and metabolic mass;  markers of liver injury and repair; treatment of hepatitis C; hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer); immunosuppression and  immune tolerance; drug metabolism; gene expression; psychometric measures of quality of life; electronic media for patient education; and other scientific issues relevant to living donor liver transplantation.

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies) to investigate scientific issues in the recently formed Clinical Research Network termed Adult to Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort Study (A2ALL). The core theme of A2ALL is comparison of outcomes of candidates for liver transplant who receive or do not receive Living Donor Transplantation (LDT).  See http://www.nih-a2all.org/default.asp for more information and list of participating centers.  The potential Collaborator’s capability statement should provide proof of expertise in the design and implementation of studies of the relevant area of investigation and should include the scientific rationale for the study proposed, proposed methods, and access to potential therapeutic or diagnostic molecules. Examples of potential studies include: 1) Characterization of changes in LIVER FUNCTION, mass, and metabolic capacity during regeneration following liver transplantation. The impact of changing liver function on the immune response as well as its effect on metabolism of immunosuppressants could be investigated using novel biochemical and imaging techniques.  2) Identification of host GENETIC FACTORS associated with LIVER REGENERATION and the syndrome of graft failure due to inadequate liver mass.  This will require the identification of genes involved in successful liver regeneration in humans, as well as pathophysiologic events in the failure of grafts. 3) Assessment of the interrelationship of LDT with IMMUNOSUPPRESSION.  Cylosporine, tacrolimus, and other immunosuppressive drugs have been associated with proliferative effects which impact liver regeneration. In addition, changes in liver function affect the pharmacokinetics of most immunosuppression.  4) Exploration of serum markers for LIVER INJURY and repair to predict hepatic histology either by themselves or in combination with other clinical and laboratory variables.  Also, the utility of these serum markers as surrogate markers of therapeutic response in study subjects participating in treatment trials.  5) Evaluation of the impact of liver regeneration on the KINETICS OF VIRAL REPLICATION in subjects with HEPATITIS C, and the impact of INTERFERONS and other therapeutic molecules on these phenomena.  6)  Prevention of liver injury from recurrence of hepatitis C in LDT recipients by pre- and post-transplant TREATMENT OF HEPATITIS C.  7)  Improved staging and treatment of HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA.  8)  Develop GENE EXPRESSION ARRAYS that are diagnostic of liver regeneration and repair and would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, STEATOSIS AND FIBROSIS in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.  9)  Study novel approaches to tolerance induction in a defined cohort of patients being prepared for elective transplantation from living donors.  10) Study the process of INFORMED UNDERSTANDING of living liver donors using ELECTRONIC MEDIA EDUCATION technology to provide patient information and correlate understanding with outcomes.  11) Development of effective PSYCHOMETRIC INSTRUMENTS to evaluate the QUALITY OF LIFE effects of living donation in this cohort of patients who will be followed long term. 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  STUDY GOAL:  The overall goal of this study is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with LDT using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy patients undergoing liver transplantation and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by development of a structured, prospective database on patients who are evaluated for LDT and either undergo LDT or instead, for various reasons, receive cadaveric livers or do not undergo transplantation at all.  Blood and tissue samples will be collected from all donors and recipients at pre-determined time points.

<DESC>Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial of corticosteroids versus placebo in patients undergoing hepatoportoenterostomy for biliary atresia

National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK): Opportunity for collaborations to implement a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial of corticosteroids versus placebo in patients undergoing hepatoportoenterostomy for biliary atresia.  A prospective database of pediatric cases of neonatal cholestasis will also be created by the newly formulated NIDDK-funded Biliary Atresia Research Consortium that will allow prospective evaluation and follow-up of a large group of patients.  Ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, genetic factors, and determinants of progression and severity of biliary atresia also pose opportunities for collaborations.

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies for collaborative arrangements to provide corticosteroids, placebo (for corticosteroids), a liquid formulation of ursodeoxycholic acid, fat soluble vitamins and Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-containing formula to perform a prospective randomized controlled trial of therapy of  biliary atresia.  The NIDDK is also seeking proposals from companies for a collaboration to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, genetic factors, and determinants of progression and severity of biliary atresia and other forms of neonatal cholestasis. 
	Collaborative arrangements may be either Clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Developments Agreements (CRADAs) pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), as appropriate.  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) seeks one or more collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology company(ies) to provide corticosteroids, placebo, a liquid formulation of ursodeoxycholic acid, fat soluble vitamins and MCT-containing formula to study important issues regarding possible treatment options and disease progression in biliary atresia.  The potential Collaborator(s) capability statement should provide proof of expertise in the design and implementation of studies involving pharmacologic and/or nutritional therapy of newborns and infants.  The statement should include the scientific rationale for the study proposed in biliary atresia, proposed dosing regimes, possible strategies for assessing compliance, proposed methods for assessing levels and/or biological effects of corticosteroids, ursodeoxycholic acid and fat soluble vitamins.  In addition, collaborators are being sought for ancillary studies.  Examples of potential studies include: 
1)	The identification of host genetic factors associated with the development of biliary atresia and neonatal cholestasis and with the risk of poor outcome after hepatoportoenterostomy. This will involve the analysis of genomic DNA from individuals with biliary atresia as well as neonatal cholestasis for functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in prioritized candidate genes, which have been identified using a combination of literature search and informatic algorithms including biologic mechanisms, pathogenesis, linkage analysis and biochemical studies.
2)	Development of methods for screening for novel or known infectious etiologies that may be associated with the development of biliary atresia.
3)	Development and/or refinement of new techniques for the diagnosis of biliary atresia and/or the evaluation of neonatal cholestasis.  These might include but are not limited to serum biochemical markers, radiologic/nuclear medicine imaging techniques, and liver histologic/histochemical markers.
4)	Exploration of biochemical and clinical markers to predict outcome after hepatoportoenterostomy. 
5)	Development of gene expression arrays that are diagnostic of biliary atresia and would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, cholestasis and fibrosis in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.
6)	Development of strategies for assessing vaccine response in infants with biliary atresia who receive either corticosteroids or placebo after hepatoportoenterostomy.  This will involve but is not limited to measuring antibody titers to vaccine antigens routinely given during the first six months of life and providing a plan for revaccination if protective levels of antibodies are not found.
7)	Development of a molecular footprint for biliary atresia.  This can be accomplished by two independent methodologies using high throughput profiling. The first will be proteomics of circulating proteins from patients with biliary atresia or diseased-controls (other causes of intrahepatic cholestasis of infancy). The second will be expression profiling using high-density gene chips and liver samples from patients with biliary atresia and diseased controls. These complimentary approaches will provide insight into potential diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets for children with biliary atresia.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Clinical Trial Agreements and CRADAs are agreements designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories. They are not grants, and not contracts for the procurement of goods/services. The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a Clinical Trial or CRADA collaborator. Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort. The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration. The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and make contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA. 
•	Study Goal:  The overall goal of this study is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with biliary atresia using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy of biliary atresia and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by development of a database of infants with neonatal cholestasis and biliary atresia including clinical information as well as serum and tissue samples.

<DESC>LOCATION CHANGE FOR MOCAS RFI PRESOLICITATION CONFERENCE.

This Request for Information (RFI) is a request for interested parties to provide comments on the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) and other documentation that will be available at http://www.dfas.mil/aso/contract/ for the rehosting of the Mechanization of Contract Administrative Services (MOCAS) System.  DFAS is contemplating a firm fixed priced contract vehicle. 

MOCAS is an automated integrated financial and contract administration system developed in the late 1960’s and enhanced over the years to maintain regulatory compliance.  The system has over 8,600 authorized end users from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and other DoD components who access the system from locations worldwide.  MOCAS resides on a DISA mainframe at Defense Enterprise Computing Center (DECC) and consists of three separate databases (MOCH, MOCL, MOCG) that serve two regions; East and West.  Each database has its own copy of executables (programs) and job control language (JCL).  MOCAS consists of both interactive on-line and batch system processing.  The primary mainframe programming languages are COBOL and MANTIS.  There are other interfaces, mid-tier, and desktop programs that operate using a variety of other languages and that are critical to the overall functions and support of MOCAS.  There are approximately 1.8 million lines of code per database.  However, the code is, in large part, mirrored in each of the three databases. 

The Government does not intend to issue a solicitation or award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for any information received in response to this RFI.  Any information received in response to this RFI that is marked propriety will be handled accordingly.  Information submitted under this RFI will not be returned.

<RESPDATE>091103
<CONTACT>Marianne C. Shuster, Contract Specialist, 973-724-4260
<DESC>Sources Sought DAAE30-03-R-0825 is amended as follows:  The U.S. Army Office of the Project Manager (PM) Combat Ammunition Systems (CAS) is conducting a market  survey to identify existing 155mm Howitzer Artillery-launched Sensor Fuzed  Munitions (SFM).  The operation and capabilities of these SFM must be analogous  to the M898 SADARM.  (The following website provides a description of the M898  SADARM, http://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/sadarm.htm.)  The U.S. Army  employed the M898 SADARM during Operation Iraqi Freedom with great success.   However, the remaining stockpile is only a fraction of the original quantity.   Thus, the U.S. Army wants to insure 155mm SFM supply alternatives to alleviate  this shortfall.  This identification of supply alternatives must minimize  schedule, cost and risk impacts.  The U.S. Army may also enter into a  compliance program to ready its howitzers to fire selected SFMs.  Respondents  must comply with the following criteria:  1)  The SFM must have a demonstrated  full-up-system capability of defeating armored vehicles.  “Full-up-system”  means the round is fired from a U.S. Army/NATO howitzer, flies to the  designated target area, and effectively engages and kills armored vehicle  targets stationed in that target area, and 2) The SFM must have an active  production capacity of their SFM nominee.  “Active production capacity” means  the manufacturer(s) involved in the production of the SFM are currently making  the parts and sub-assemblies needed as well as the complete projectile.   Interested firms should provide their qualifications and capabilities within  twenty (20) calendar days of this published notice via email to  mshuster@pica.army.mil.  Provide manufacturer’s name, address, point-of-contact  with telephone number and email address, size of business (small/large), and  country where the facility is located.  This Market Survey is for planning  purposes only and should not be construed as a request for proposal (RFP) or as  an obligation on the part of the U.S. Government.  Respondents will not be  notified of the results of this survey.  SEE NOTE 25.

<SUBJECT>87 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It supercedes Committee for Purchase form People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled  FEDBIZOPS notice posted June 3, 2003 concerning the addition of processed dry Pinto Beans, Yellow Dry Split Peas, Green Dry Split Peas, and Lentils to the Procurement List (PL) of the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind Or Severely Disabled under the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971.  However, if your response to the June 3, 2003 FEDBIZOPS notice is not changed by the information presented here, you need not respond and the Committee will use that information in its consideration of this action.

The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind Or Severely Disabled has been asked to consider adding 30% of the total United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Farm Service Agency (FSA) requirement for processed dry Black Beans, Black Turtle Beans, Dark Kidney Beans, Garbanzo Beans, Great Northern Beans, Light Kidney Beans, Pinto Beans, Small Red Beans, Yellow Dry Split Peas, Yellow Dry Whole Peas, Green Dry Split Peas, Green Dry Whole Peas, Lentils, and Yellow Soybeans to its PL.  Some of these items may be provided under contract to the Federal Government by your company.  This action would be taken under the authority of the JWOD Act whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies (NPA) employing such individuals served by the JWOD Program.  Once these products are added to the PL, 30% of the USDA/FSA requirements for them must be purchased by the Government from a NPA (or agencies) designated by the Committee.  If the Committee approves the proposed addition, the NPA currently developing this project, Minot Vocational Readjustment Workshop, Inc., will purchase processed pulse products, and package them to fulfill 30% of USDA/FSA's total requirements for the commodities.  In determining whether a product(s) is suitable for addition to its PL, the Committee considers the impact on the current or most recent contractor(s) for the product(s).  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on a contractor's sales, and it also considers the extent to which the contractor(s) is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding an item, or portion thereof to the PL, offset any potential adverse impact on the current contractor(s).  When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or otherwise affiliated with another corporation(s), please identify the other corporation(s) to which your company is related and the nature of the relationship, and provide total sales data for the other corporation(s) as well as your company.  To determine whether the addition of 30% of the total USDA/FSA requirement for processed dry Black Beans, Black Turtle Beans, Dark Kidney Beans, Garbanzo Beans, Great Northern Beans, Light Kidney Beans, Pinto Beans, Small Red Beans, Yellow Dry Split Peas, Yellow Dry Whole Peas, Green Dry Split Peas, Green Dry Whole Peas, Lentils, and Yellow Soybeans to its PL would have a severe adverse impact on your company, the Committee requires you submit the following information for your company:  1) your company's total gross revenues from all sources for the most recent 12-month period available; 2) revenue generated from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL for the same 12-month period; 3) have you provided this product under previous contracts, and for how long; 
4) are you certified as a small disadvantage business by the Department of Labor; and 5) are you providing the product(s) under the SBA 8(a) Program?  The Committee will also consider any additional comments you might wish to make that can assist the it to determine the potential effect of its action on your firm.  It would be appreciated if you would provide audited sales information.  If the information you provide the Committee is confidential, please advise us and we will ensure that it is safeguarded.  You are requested to respond to this notice no later than Friday, September 19, 2003, by mail or FAX at 703-603-0030.  If the information  is not received by this date, and we have not received a previous response from your company, the Committee could conclude that the impact of the addition of 30% of the total USDA/FSA requirement for processed dry Black Beans, Black Turtle Beans, Dark Kidney Beans, Garbanzo Beans, Great Northern Beans, Light Kidney Beans, Pinto Beans, Small Red Beans, Yellow Dry Split Peas, Yellow Dry Whole Peas, Green Dry Split Peas, Green Dry Whole Peas, Lentils, and Yellow Soybeans to its PL would be minimal on your company.

If you would like more information or have questions concerning the Committee and its authority, you should refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51 both which are available through the Committee’s website at www.jwod.gov.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback of the Committee staff at 703-603-0035 for further information.  Thank you for your consideration of this request.

<SUBJECT>99 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.

We have been asked to consider adding to the Procurement List the following items: CD/DVD Label Kit (7530-00-NIB-0660); CD/DVD Label Refill (7530-00-NIB-0688); SKILCRAFT Savvy Cleaning Products (7930-00-NIB-0080, -0081, -0082, -0152, -0153, -0154, 
-0155, -0156, -0157, -0158, -0159, -0183, -0173, -01-85, -0187 and -0189); Safety-Walk, Tapes and Treads (7110-00-NIB-0022, 
-0031, -0032, -0046, -0053, -0054, -0061, -0065, -0075, -0137,
-0137, -0138, -0139, -0140, -0141, -0142, -0143 and -0144); Hydration-On-the-Move System (8465-00-NIB-0071 thru -0079 and 8465-00-NIB-0092 thru -0097) and Canteen, One Quart - Flexible (8465-00-NIB-0041).  All items are for the GSA Multiple Award Schedules.
In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm’s sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<SUBJECT>A -- Scientific investigations of living donor liver transplantation using clinical information and tissue and blood samples from adult liver transplant recipients
<DESC>Collaboration in scientific investigations of living donor liver transplantation using clinical information and tissue and blood samples from adult liver transplant recipients in the areas of cellular and genetic aspects of liver regeneration; liver function and metabolic mass;  markers of liver injury and repair; treatment of hepatitis C; hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer); immunosuppression and  immune tolerance; drug metabolism; gene expression; psychometric measures of quality of life; electronic media for patient education; and other scientific issues relevant to living donor liver transplantation.

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies) to investigate scientific issues in the recently formed Clinical Research Network termed Adult to Adult Living Donor Liver Transplantation Cohort Study (A2ALL). The core theme of A2ALL is comparison of outcomes of candidates for liver transplant who receive or do not receive Living Donor Transplantation (LDT).  See http://www.nih-a2all.org/default.asp for more information and list of participating centers.  The potential Collaborator’s capability statement should provide proof of expertise in the design and implementation of studies of the relevant area of investigation and should include the scientific rationale for the study proposed, proposed methods, and access to potential therapeutic or diagnostic molecules. Examples of potential studies include: 1) Characterization of changes in LIVER FUNCTION, mass, and metabolic capacity during regeneration following liver transplantation. The impact of changing liver function on the immune response as well as its effect on metabolism of immunosuppressants could be investigated using novel biochemical and imaging techniques.  2) Identification of host GENETIC FACTORS associated with LIVER REGENERATION and the syndrome of graft failure due to inadequate liver mass.  This will require the identification of genes involved in successful liver regeneration in humans, as well as pathophysiologic events in the failure of grafts. 3) Assessment of the interrelationship of LDT with IMMUNOSUPPRESSION.  Cylosporine, tacrolimus, and other immunosuppressive drugs have been associated with proliferative effects which impact liver regeneration. In addition, changes in liver function affect the pharmacokinetics of most immunosuppression.  4) Exploration of serum markers for LIVER INJURY and repair to predict hepatic histology either by themselves or in combination with other clinical and laboratory variables.  Also, the utility of these serum markers as surrogate markers of therapeutic response in study subjects participating in treatment trials.  5) Evaluation of the impact of liver regeneration on the KINETICS OF VIRAL REPLICATION in subjects with HEPATITIS C, and the impact of INTERFERONS and other therapeutic molecules on these phenomena.  6)  Prevention of liver injury from recurrence of hepatitis C in LDT recipients by pre- and post-transplant TREATMENT OF HEPATITIS C.  7)  Improved staging and treatment of HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA.  8)  Develop GENE EXPRESSION ARRAYS that are diagnostic of liver regeneration and repair and would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, STEATOSIS AND FIBROSIS in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.  9)  Study novel approaches to tolerance induction in a defined cohort of patients being prepared for elective transplantation from living donors.  10) Study the process of INFORMED UNDERSTANDING of living liver donors using ELECTRONIC MEDIA EDUCATION technology to provide patient information and correlate understanding with outcomes.  11) Development of effective PSYCHOMETRIC INSTRUMENTS to evaluate the QUALITY OF LIFE effects of living donation in this cohort of patients who will be followed long term. 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  STUDY GOAL:  The overall goal of this study is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with LDT using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy patients undergoing liver transplantation and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by development of a structured, prospective database on patients who are evaluated for LDT and either undergo LDT or instead, for various reasons, receive cadaveric livers or do not undergo transplantation at all.  Blood and tissue samples will be collected from all donors and recipients at pre-determined time points. 
Applicants to support this study must include a description of investigators and staff that would facilitate collaboration in multicenter clinical studies of liver transplant patients.  Applicants should provide a detailed description of the methods and drugs which might be used.  A description of the laboratory tests that are needed including assays to determine levels of target molecules or the genes encoding them along with appropriate methods for performing them should be provided, as well as other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.  Also included should be the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.  If an intervention is proposed, how the drug or product will be sent to each participating center as well as packaging, storing, and accountability issues must be presented.

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the collaborator’s capability statements received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their capability statements.

<SUBJECT>A -- Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial of corticosteroids versus placebo in patients undergoing hepatoportoenterostomy for biliary atresia
<DESC>Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial of corticosteroids versus placebo in patients undergoing hepatoportoenterostomy for biliary atresia

National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK): Opportunity for collaborations to implement a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial of corticosteroids versus placebo in patients undergoing hepatoportoenterostomy for biliary atresia.  A prospective database of pediatric cases of neonatal cholestasis will also be created by the newly formulated NIDDK-funded Biliary Atresia Research Consortium that will allow prospective evaluation and follow-up of a large group of patients.  Ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, genetic factors, and determinants of progression and severity of biliary atresia also pose opportunities for collaborations.

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies for collaborative arrangements to provide corticosteroids, placebo (for corticosteroids), a liquid formulation of ursodeoxycholic acid, fat soluble vitamins and Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-containing formula to perform a prospective randomized controlled trial of therapy of  biliary atresia.  The NIDDK is also seeking proposals from companies for a collaboration to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, genetic factors, and determinants of progression and severity of biliary atresia and other forms of neonatal cholestasis. 
	Collaborative arrangements may be either Clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Developments Agreements (CRADAs) pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), as appropriate.  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) seeks one or more collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology company(ies) to provide corticosteroids, placebo, a liquid formulation of ursodeoxycholic acid, fat soluble vitamins and MCT-containing formula to study important issues regarding possible treatment options and disease progression in biliary atresia.  The potential Collaborator(s) capability statement should provide proof of expertise in the design and implementation of studies involving pharmacologic and/or nutritional therapy of newborns and infants.  The statement should include the scientific rationale for the study proposed in biliary atresia, proposed dosing regimes, possible strategies for assessing compliance, proposed methods for assessing levels and/or biological effects of corticosteroids, ursodeoxycholic acid and fat soluble vitamins.  In addition, collaborators are being sought for ancillary studies.  Examples of potential studies include: 
1)	The identification of host genetic factors associated with the development of biliary atresia and neonatal cholestasis and with the risk of poor outcome after hepatoportoenterostomy. This will involve the analysis of genomic DNA from individuals with biliary atresia as well as neonatal cholestasis for functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in prioritized candidate genes, which have been identified using a combination of literature search and informatic algorithms including biologic mechanisms, pathogenesis, linkage analysis and biochemical studies.
2)	Development of methods for screening for novel or known infectious etiologies that may be associated with the development of biliary atresia.
3)	Development and/or refinement of new techniques for the diagnosis of biliary atresia and/or the evaluation of neonatal cholestasis.  These might include but are not limited to serum biochemical markers, radiologic/nuclear medicine imaging techniques, and liver histologic/histochemical markers.
4)	Exploration of biochemical and clinical markers to predict outcome after hepatoportoenterostomy. 
5)	Development of gene expression arrays that are diagnostic of biliary atresia and would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, cholestasis and fibrosis in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.
6)	Development of strategies for assessing vaccine response in infants with biliary atresia who receive either corticosteroids or placebo after hepatoportoenterostomy.  This will involve but is not limited to measuring antibody titers to vaccine antigens routinely given during the first six months of life and providing a plan for revaccination if protective levels of antibodies are not found.
7)	Development of a molecular footprint for biliary atresia.  This can be accomplished by two independent methodologies using high throughput profiling. The first will be proteomics of circulating proteins from patients with biliary atresia or diseased-controls (other causes of intrahepatic cholestasis of infancy). The second will be expression profiling using high-density gene chips and liver samples from patients with biliary atresia and diseased controls. These complimentary approaches will provide insight into potential diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets for children with biliary atresia.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Clinical Trial Agreements and CRADAs are agreements designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories. They are not grants, and not contracts for the procurement of goods/services. The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a Clinical Trial or CRADA collaborator. Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort. The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration. The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and make contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA. 
•	Study Goal:  The overall goal of this study is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with biliary atresia using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy of biliary atresia and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by development of a database of infants with neonatal cholestasis and biliary atresia including clinical information as well as serum and tissue samples.  In addition, the Biliary Atresia Research Consortium will conduct a prospective, randomized, double blind controlled trial of promising therapies for biliary atresia, including use of corticosteroids compared to placebo.    
Applicants for a collaborative arrangement to support this clinical trial must include a description of investigators and staff with experience and expertise to collaborate in multicenter clinical studies to assess patients with biliary atresia and neonatal cholestasis.  Applicants should provide a detailed description of the pharmacokinetics of the proposed drugs to be used including how and when the drugs should be taken.  The process for biologic sample collection, storage and handling needs must be included.  A description of the laboratory tests that are needed to monitor therapy, including assays to determine specific drug levels and/or biological effects along with appropriate methods for performing them should be provided, as well as other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.  Also included should be the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.  How the drug or product will be sent to each participating center as well as packaging, storing, and accountability issues must be presented.
Capability Statements:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their capability statements.

<SUBJECT>D -- Request For Information (RFI) Mechanization of Contract Administrative Services (MOCAS) Rehost
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is a request for interested parties to provide comments on the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) and other documentation that will be available at http://www.dfas.mil/aso/contract/ for the rehosting of the Mechanization of Contract Administrative Services (MOCAS) System.  DFAS is contemplating a firm fixed priced contract vehicle. 

MOCAS is an automated integrated financial and contract administration system developed in the late 1960’s and enhanced over the years to maintain regulatory compliance.  The system has over 8,600 authorized end users from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and other DoD components who access the system from locations worldwide.  MOCAS resides on a DISA mainframe at Defense Enterprise Computing Center (DECC) and consists of three separate databases (MOCH, MOCL, MOCG) that serve two regions; East and West.  Each database has its own copy of executables (programs) and job control language (JCL).  MOCAS consists of both interactive on-line and batch system processing.  The primary mainframe programming languages are COBOL and MANTIS.  There are other interfaces, mid-tier, and desktop programs that operate using a variety of other languages and that are critical to the overall functions and support of MOCAS.  There are approximately 1.8 million lines of code per database.  However, the code is, in large part, mirrored in each of the three databases. 

The Government does not intend to issue a solicitation or award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for any information received in response to this RFI.  Any information received in response to this RFI that is marked propriety will be handled accordingly.  Information submitted under this RFI will not be returned.

<SUBJECT>D -- Request for Informastion
<DESC>ALERT System - Request for Information 

Description:  The following Request for Information (RFI) is issued for purposes of conducting market research and allowing commercial IT companies to propose technologies and/or methodologies that could be utilized to identify and monitor potential fraud in the Food Stamp Program.  All responses are due not later than 11:00am (local time) Monday, September 22, 2003.  Comments, suggestions and questions about the proposed new technology may supplement or be incorporated into the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service’s (FNS) decision support system called the Anti-fraud Locator using EBT Retailer Transactions (ALERT).  FNS is in the process of formulating the acquisition and project strategy for the next base contract and as a result wants to identify commercially available technologies that could be either incorporated into the ALERT system or separately implemented.  FNS has obtained the support of Information Systems Support, Inc. (ISS) and MAXIMUS, Inc, as independent technical consultants assisting in the review of the RFI responses.  ISS/MAXIMUS is prohibited from submitting a proposal to any procurement request that may result from this RFI.  

All information submitted in response to this RFI will be used for planning purposes only.  FAR Clause 52.215-3 Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (OCT 1997) applies.  All information will be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure.  Please ensure any sensitive or protected information is clearly marked as such.  FNS will consider all information received for future incorporation into ALERT as it evaluates the responses received from the vendor community.  This is not a formal solicitation under FAR Part 15 or a FAR Part 13 simplified acquisition, but a request for interested parties to provide information.  No solicitation document exists and requests for a solicitation will be unanswered.

An overview of data elements and other technical information regarding the current system may be accessed at the USDA website:  http://www.fns.usda.gov/.

COTS: Vendors with various technology products are encouraged to respond to this request with a high level concept paper that explains the approach and offers new technologies and/or methodologies that would improve the current tools of FNS in its analysis of ALERT data.  It is requested that responses include an estimate (Rough Order of Magnitude of the time and costs (hardware, software, and personnel) needed to design and implement.  We do not expect full cycle system developments to be offered, but are specifically interested in proven products, technologies and/or tools that enhance or provide additional capabilities to identify and monitor potential fraud using the existing and future data elements available from Food Stamp Program Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) transactions.  FNS will use the information received from the responses to this RFI to help determine the requirements for the next RFP for ALERT support.  FNS anticipates releasing the RFP for ALERT support in the 1st quarter of 2004.  

Current Architecture: The current ALERT application is a n-tiered server architecture that operates on Proliant 8500 servers using the Windows 2000 operating system and Sybase database system software.  The application software is programmed using Delphi.  There are four main software components 
¨	The ALERT analysis software includes specific scans that target certain suspect patterns of fraudulent activity.  ALERT utilizes data from two sources; transaction data that is received from the states operation EBT systems, and retailer data that is extracted from present mainframe systems that house the FNS national retailer database for authorizing and monitoring participating Food Stamp retailers.
¨	A web site provides user information on existing releases, tutorials and a data mart known as AMART.  
¨	ESSRA is a component which provides retailer management data that has been extracted weekly from the FNS national retailer tracking database.  ESSRA is used in the field and regional offices to manage daily retailer authorization activities and allows users to download data into standard Excel spreadsheets or Access tables for further manipulation 
¨	Watchlist is a management reporting tool designed to systemically track identified suspect retailers and the status of activities by FNS staff regarding each identified retailer.  
	
	FNS’ overall enterprise architecture is transitioning from mainframe to server and web-based technologies.  Current software standards require Section 508 compliance for all agency systems.  FNS is migrating to SQL Server 2000, which will become the database system for ALERT in the future.  Users are provided Windows 2000 and Office Suite products on their workstations or laptops installed with the ALERT application software.  Depending on access to the Department Wide Area Network, users connect via the WAN or utilize dial-in capabilities.  Future solutions may entail use of Virtual Private Networks (VPN) for secured connections via the Internet.  The solution we may deploy would need to be supportable on our present and future system architecture; however, we will not preclude any technological tools should they present an innovative tool that merits consideration in this initiative.  
	
	Background: ALERT is a decision support management system built around the retailer management and compliance requirements of the Food Stamp Program.  The primary purpose is to load and analyze food stamp transactional data, e.g., food stamp purchases in any of 150,000 authorized food stamp retailer locations.  Data is submitted to FNS by State EBT processors each month.   Only a few States remain to be implemented, the largest being California.  At present, there are nearly 70 million transactions processed monthly and a rolling 6 months of data is maintained on-line.  When all states have implemented EBT, monthly transaction data is estimated to be about 85 million transactions.  Key elements of each electronic transaction are extracted by the EBT processors and provided to the ALERT system.  This data includes information such as dollar amount, location, terminal ID, date and time of the transaction, type of entry (card swiped through a reader or manually key –entered), and whether a paper voucher was issued.
	
	Business Requirements: FNS is looking for technology and analytic tools that can enhance the current system functionality.  The FNS preference is that the system architecture is web and server based.  The system must be accessible to a user base of over 600 local and remote users that are accessing data for inquiry, query, and download.  Users currently access the system via a wide area network or through dial-up access.  Any proposed solution should be able to offer the following:  
¨	Ability to identify evolving trends in suspect retailer behavior as they change.
¨	Allow for ad hoc query capabilities
¨	Identify possible relationships that either enhance existing scans and pattern analysis or support the overall retailer management and integrity goals of FNS.
¨	Support set pattern analysis within the FNS systems environment.

There is considerable latitude for the range of proposed solutions.  These could include COTS solutions, improvement of existing methodologies, or some new technology.  The proposed solution is desired to be compatible with existing and planned systems architecture within FNS.  However, should a solution not be compatible with said architecture, yet otherwise possess merit and benefit to accomplishing the objectives of FNS, it will be considered.

Future Considerations:  The existing data analysis being performed within ALERT has undergone limited revision since its inception.  The current requirements for data being received from the EBT processors have not been altered since the system was initiated in 1996/1997.  There is additional information within the transaction data being collected by the EBT processors that may be of use to FNS, such as telephone nodes or card replacements.  Consequently, new data elements may be added in the future to the transaction records being received from the EBT processors.  Potential solutions being recommended by the vendor community should take this into consideration.

Responses:  Vendors interested in responding to this RFI need to submit a capability statement that clearly and convincingly identifies their capabilities.  In addition, potential vendors must substantiate their capability with the following supplemental information: methodology, technical data, design, brochures, product names, etc.  If these items are available under a GSA schedule, please provide the contract schedule and information.  All responses must be received no later than 11:00am (local time) Monday, September 22, 2003.  Responses must be submitted to the following address:  USDA/FNS/ASD/CMB, Tina M Nevitt Contracting Officer, 3101 Park Center Drive Room 228, Alexandria, VA   22302-1500.  Your response shall not exceed 15 single sided pages, plus supplemental information.  You are required to include an electronic copy in Microsoft Word or a compatible format (Adobe PDF).

Award shall be made to the offeror whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.  The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1)Technical Capability factors that adhere to the technical specifications, user-friendly temperature control, cryogen maintenance specification requirements.  User-friendly temperature control and cryogen maintenance requirements are inherently germane to the use of the system by NIST personnel. User-friendly temperature control that is easy to operate, either through simple and objective procedures or a uniform interface, shall be judged more highly. Additionally, Cryogen maintenance requirements refer to both the periodic need to refill liquid cryogens (nitrogen and helium) and the periodic need to recycle closed-loop cryogenic helium-3.  Systems that operate for longer periods between cryogen maintenance shall be judged more highly. 2) Past performance and 3) Price.  Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price. The selection factors for this RFQ are adherence to the technical specifications, user-friendly temperature control, cryogen maintenance requirements, past performance and price.*** 

Evaluation of Technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation.  Offerors shall include the make and model of the product, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature which clearly documents that the offered product meets or exceeds the specifications stated above.  Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and/or information provided by NIST and its affiliates.  Offerors shall provide a list of at least THREE (3) REFERENCES to whom the same or similar products have been sold.  The list of references shall include, at a minimum: The name of the reference contact person and the company or organization; the telephone number of the reference contact person; the contract or grant number; the amount of the contract and the address and the telephone number of the Contracting Officer if applicable; and the date of delivery or the date services were completed.

<DESC>The 21st Contracting Squadron, Peterson Air Force Base (AFB), CO, issue’s this request for quote of Personal Alarm System (PAS) manufactured by Cimarron Technologies, part number NR-01-4672a or equal.  The PAS must be pre-approved by the ICBM Program Manager at Hill Air Force Base, UT. and ready for immediate purchase (cannot interfere with ICBMS systems).  This is not a first article requirement and only fully ready commercial units will be purchased.  Certain PAS proprietary information cannot be released with out the consent of Cimarron Technologies.  However, salient information will be provided upon request.  Briefly put, the PAS must transmit and receive, be compact, self-contained, operate at maximum efficiency, have an external stubby antenna, know if the user is in trouble, be able to transmit problems intermittently and be specific to each user (coded).  The over all effect should be that ground forces can stay in contact with maintenance personnel in the missile silos under ground both directly and intermittently, so that if personnel cannot verbally communicate, the PAS will know if a man is down and notify others.  This requirement will possibly be competed again as a first article requirement in 2007.  The quantity of 50 PAS unit’s are required. The system requirements also include transmitter batteries (two each per unit, 100 total), battery chargers (one each per unit, 50 total), multi station rapid charger for transmitter radio batteries (capable of charging six batteries at once, total of 6), shipping and warranty.  The business size standard is 750 employees.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334220.  The government anticipates the award of a firm fixed-price contract of the system to include any and all applicable installation. Any responsible companies may submit information to the POC listed- This is not a request for quote, bid, or proposal.
