<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  Membranes are critical components of cellular structure and function involving the partitioning of organelles, protecting the integrity of the genome, and providing defense from foreign molecules and external conditions that may damage or destroy the cell.  Proteins that are inserted into the membrane are highly important biological and pharmacological targets.  Despite their biological importance and natural abundance, the analysis of hydrophobic membrane proteins has been difficult.  Techniques using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis based mass spectrometry (2-D-PAGE-MS) often result in under-representation of these proteins. This is probably due to the inability of surfactants to effectively solubilize these water insoluble proteins in the aqueous medium used for isoelectric focusing.  Moreover, these proteins tend to precipitate at their isoelectric point.  Attempts to extract membrane proteins using organic solvent precipitation prior to 2-D electrophoresis have not shown significant improvement compared to surfactant-based protocols.  An alternative technique to 2-D-PAGE-MS analysis is in-solution solubilization of the membrane proteins using surfactants followed by enzymatic or chemical fragmentation of membrane proteins, then separation and analysis of the complex mixture of peptides using liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).  However, the presence of surfactants can suppress analyte ionization and interfere with chromatographic separations, requiring additional manipulations to remove these contaminants and potentially lead to significant sample loses, particularly for low abundance proteins.  Thus, the main obstacle for a large-scale mass spectrometric analysis of hydrophobic integral membrane proteins is the inability of current methodologies to achieve the dissolution of these hydrophobic proteins from the phospholipid bilayer while maintaining their solubility throughout the whole isolation and separation process and simultaneously avoiding the reagents which may interfere with ESI.  To address this need, scientists at PNNL have developed a surfactant-free sample preparation method designed for large-scale LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of integral membrane proteins.  With this method, extraction of hydrophobic integral membrane proteins was achieved using high pH fractionation, thermal denaturation and organic solvent assisted solubilization.  Additionally, avoidance of chaotropic denaturants and surfactants enhanced the quality of ESI-MS and further facilitated a large-scale LC-MS/MS analysis of the membrane subproteome.  The results showed that hydrophobic membrane spanning peptides are readily detected using the developed method in conjunction with  single-dimension high-pressure reversed-phase capillary LC coupled with ESI-MS/MS.  Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business planfor the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses at FAR 52.213-4 Terms and Conditions, and any others that are applicable and in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) and the Defense Acquisition Circular (DAC). It is the contractor's responsibility to be familiar with all applicable clauses and provisions. The full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulation may be accessed at: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/. No "Hard Copy" of RFQ will be prepared or made available.  The Government intends to award, on a Sole Source basis, an order to University of California, San Diego for the following task. STATEMENT OF WORK.  TITLE OPTOELECTRONIC DETECTORS, SWITCHES, AND MODULATORS.    1.0 INTRODUCTION: As part of the DARPA Photonic Analog to Digital Converter Technology Program (PACT), the SSC-SD Optically Clock Track and Hold (OC T&H) project is developing an optically clocked track and hold circuit with reduced error due to aperture time and aperture jitter.  Reducing residual timing jitter and increasing the optoelectronic (OE) detector response are requirements needed to achieve the performance goals of the project.  As a result there is an interest in developing high power pulse OE photodiode detectors.  In support of this DARPA PACT project, SSC-SD and Dr. Paul Yu at UCSD are collaborating on an effort to develop high-power high-speed OE waveguide photodiode detectors sensitive to 1.55um light. As part of an ILIR program, SSC-SD is developing a novel dual-wavelength transmission photonic link with even harmonics cancellation for enhanced link linearity.

<DESC>The government has a requirement for 6000 lbs of a nitramine based feedstock for use in current facilities at IH. The material is a granulated EX99 formulation which has been successfully demonstrated in the past 5 years under sole source contracts to Nexplo Explosives. It is manufactured via a patented process, patent # 4 983235, held by Nexplo Explosives.  The material has been previously purchased from Nexplo and manufactured into a final form at IH. Under special license agreement from Nexplo the Navy is currently designing and building a facility to manufacture this material at IH.  Due to delays the facility will not be online in time to manufacture the material to meet the Navy's qualification time schedule.  Therefore the material must be acquired from Nexplo to prevent qualification time schedule slippage.  The Navy anticipates awarding a sole source contract to Nexplo E xplosives to acquire the material to continue qualification.  The NAICS Code is 325920, Size Standard is 750 employees and FSC Code is 13775. The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price contract. Negotiation being conducted using other than full and open competition procedures pursuant to authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (C) (1). Questions should be directed to Samantha Gray, Contract Specialist who can be reached at (301) 744-6747 or email graysm@ih.navy.mil

These criteria must be met for each separate utility system.  Proposals will be evaluated for each type of system and each location resulting in a possibility of six (6) separately awarded contracts under this solicitation.  

Concurrent with the sale of the utility systems, the Government will acquire distribution utility services to replace the service currently provided by the Government.  The sale of the utility systems and the acquisition of utility services are subject to terms and conditions provided in this request for proposal.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION
FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE
ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN
SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-07.*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334119 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit an offer. ***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for one (1) Whole Body Personnel Contamination Monitor to be used in detecting beta contamination in a two-step process.***All interested offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item:  Line Item 0001: Quantity one (1) each, Personnel Contamination Monitor (PCM).  The following specifications define the performance requirements for the PCM monitors for radioactive surface contamination over a worker's body while the worker stands inside: (1) PCM shall automatically detect the presence of beta emitting contamination on the clothes and exposed skin of a person while they stand in the unit.  PCM should have its own computer to control unit operations, troubleshooting, calibration, and service.  The computer can be internal or external to the unit. (2) The detectors on a PCM shall be gas proportional detectors.  The detector windows shall be of a thin, industry standard type material such that detection of low energy betas is permitted, 14C for example.  Detectors shall be provided with mesh type protective screens with at least 65% open space for detection.  If gas flow proportional detectors are proposed, then a gas management system shall be incorporated to reduce gas consumption.  In addition, a monitoring system shall also be incorporated to monitor gas supply and alarm on insufficient level/supply. (3) PCM shall be able to detect 5000 dpm/100 cm2 of Cs137, at one inch from any detector, with a 90% probability of detection and a 0.1% false alarm rate with a maximum 10 second/side count in normal background of 20 micron/hr. (4) A hand held 'frisker' detector probe of the same type detector with a local readout and alarm shall be incorporated or attached to the PCM thus allowing for detailed frisk type surveys in the event of a contamination alarm from the PCM. (5) For setup and calibration, the unit shall include a method for entry and selection of all operating and test parameters.  They shall also be shown on a video display.  As a minimum, this must include the following: (a) Adjustment of the high voltage (i.e. it shall be computer controlled); (b) Calibration and maintenance utilities to permit the user to perform automatic detector plateaus, view background count rates, perform efficiency determinations, and generate calibration reports; (c) User selectable parameters for count time, false alarm rate, and confidence factor for probability of detection; (d) A key switch or password shall prevent unauthorized entry to the test mode.  If a key is used, a minimum of 2 keys shall be supplied. (6) The PCM shall have contoured monitoring surfaces to conform to body shape and minimize distance between body and detector window and shall have not less than 9000 cm2 of active monitoring area in each step.  Detection area shall include the whole body, i.e.? head/face, arms and hands (both palm and back side), complete torso, legs and feet. PCM shall be capable of detecting contamination on bottom, top, and sides of the shoes.  Detection area shall be divided into a minimum of 20 separate countingzones to allow for identification and localization of contaminated areas. (7) Detector counting electronics and software shall also perform 'sum zone' logic to the results permitting contamination monitoring for widely distributed contamination based on the summed results of several adjacent detectors.  User selectable confidence levels and false alarm rates shall also permitted. (8) PCM design shall have sensors to ensure the worker's body surfaces being monitored are sufficiently close to the monitoring detector to ensure accuracy of results.  Sensors shall not have any moving parts.  A signal and voice prompt instruction shall be provided to alert the user of improper positioning.  The measurement shall be suspended until the proper position has been achieved. (9) PCM shall provide an audible (alarm and voice instruction) and visual alarm when contamination is detected. (10) PCM shall have user-selectable alarm set points for each detector. (11) User shall be able to select PCM operational mode as either using a fixed count time with varying sensitivity depending on the background or using a fixed sensitivity with varying count time depending on the background. (12) PCM shall automatically compensate for varying gamma dose rate backgrounds.  This feature shall be user adjustable/selectable and automatically monitored and controlled by the unit.  Background update times shall be selectable and a 'rolling average' shall be used for internal alarm and count time decision-making logic.  The unit shall compensate for the reduced background with a user in the instrument.  There shall be a software utility to automatically determine this reduction.  User selectable confidence levels and false alarm rates shall also permitted. (13) The unit shall perform self-tests with user selectable parameters to establish whether or not the operating parameters can be met.  If user selected operating parameters cannot be met in the given instrument condition, for example an intermittent high background, then the PCM shall automatically place itself Out Of Service.  Once the conditions have changed such that operation within the set parameters can be achieved, the unit shall automatically return to service.  All such changes in status shall be monitored and recorded by the internal system and/or connected pc. (14) PCM shall automatically compensate for varying Radon backgrounds levels as well as identify and report the possible presence of Radon contamination.  This feature shall be user adjustable/selectable and automatically monitored and controlled by the unit. (15) PCM shall have keyboard, printer and LCD/CRT connections under key lock on front of unit, or easily accessible in the case where the back of the unit is blocked or not accessible. (16) PCM shall allow for routine maintenance to be done from the front and/or sides when access to the rear is blocked or inaccessible.

<DESC>The Technical Processing Automation Instruction Office (TPAIO) of the Library of Congress has a requirement to convert modules of an existing course into a WBT (web-based training) course for use on the Internet.  The title of the course is Cataloger's Desktop Introduction and a printed script exists for the entire content of the instructor-led course currently taught by TPAIO. 

Cataloger's Desktop is a software product created and sold by the Cataloging Distribution Service (CDS) at the Library of Congress.  Cataloger's Desktop provides access to a large number of electronic manuals and procedural documentation that describe standards to follow for performing cataloging and classification tasks in a library.  Staff at the Library of Congress use the product, as well as many library professionals and para-professionals world wide.    CDS's customers need an introductory training program on Cataloger's Desktop that explains the navigation and searching features of the product.  Customers are widely dispersed and a WBT Course is the most effective way to reach all of them. 

Contract assistance is needed to design the course structure and template pages and provide simulation to convert the instructor-led Cataloger's Desktop course into an asynchronous WBT Course available to users of the product.  TPAIO staff will make intellectual decisions relating to the course content, enter text into the course templates, and provide graphics.  The current instructor-led course takes approximately 4 hours to present and consists of 67 pages of handouts.  However this WBT Course converts only the first 51 pages of the handouts which focus on navigation and searching techniques for the product.  The course introduces the software and has no prerequisites.  Library staff voluntarily  take the course to help them better utilize Cataloger's Desktop. An annual update to the WBT Course is planned to incorporate changes to the product.  

The basis of the WBT Course is "Brief Learning Topics" (BLTs) executed in intervals of 20 minutes or less.   The WBT Course will be maintained and updated by TPAIO using the following tools: Dreamweaver, Photoshop, Fireworks, Flash.  Consequently, the developed course must use software compatible to those listed above. The WBT Course shall be well-formed with valid HTML pages.  It should not use non-standard HTML features or deprecated HTML features.  The entire WBT Course must be fully viewable by all major browsers, specifically Netscape 4.73 and Internet Explorer 5.5.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Contractor may be required to visit various computer facilities, offices, clinical and research areas within NMCSD.  11.  DRUG USE:  The Secretary of the Navy has determined that the illegal possession or use of drugs and paraphernalia in a military setting contributes directly to military drug abuse and undermines command efforts to eliminate drug abuse among military personnel.  The policy of the Department of the Navy (including the Marine Corps) is to deter and detect drug offenses on military installations.  Measures taken to identify drug offenses on military installations and to prevent introduction of illegal drugs and paraphernalia include routine random inspection of personal possessions on entry or exit.  If there is probable cause to believe that the contractor has been engaged in use, possession, or trafficking of drugs, the contractor may be detained for a limited period of time until he or she can be removed from the installation or turned over to the local law enforcement personnel having jurisdiction.  When illegal drugs are discovered in the course of an inspection or search of a vehicle operated by a contractor, the contractor and vehicle may be detained for a reasonable period of time necessary to surrender the individual and vehicle to appropriate civil law enforcement personnel.  Action may be taken to suspend working privileges as well as installation driving privileges.  Implicit with the acceptance of this contract is the agreement by the contractor to comply with all Federal and State laws as well as regulations issued by the commander of the military installation concerning illegal drugs and paraphernalia.12.

<DESC>This modification increases the maximum number of E-2C Parachute Survival Ensembles and components to be order under Order 00013 of Thin-Pack Parachute Basic Ordering Agreement N68936-00-G-001 from by 5 from 95 to up to 100 E-2C parachute systems.  See synopsis posted June 5, 2002 for details.  Order 0013 is a continuation of the production line started under Order 0005 under this BOA.  Deliveries to start in November 2002.  Contractor shall deliver 8 systems per month until completion of order.  This requirement is being negotiated on a sole source basis with SEI as the Thin-Pack drawing packages have proprietary markings making design information unreleaseable.  SEI is the only source currently producing the parachute survival ensembles incorporating the Thin-Pack/Lightweight Environmentally Sealed Parachute Assembly (LESPA) technology. The "Thin-Pack" lightweight systems have a 5 1/2 year repack cycle (versus 240-670 days) with a goal of 27.5 years total life (versus 10 years).  No other source has SEI's unique knowledge and expertise in the Thin-Pack technology for E-2C.  The production of the supplies listed requires a substantial initial investment or an extended period of preparation for manufacture.  Proposed order type: Firm Fixed Price.  FOB Origin.    The PSE are to be delivered to Northrop-Grumman, Melbourne, FL for incorporation into the E-2C Aircraft coming off Grumman's production line.  Packing, marking and shipping requirements will be covered by separate order under the BOA.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal or quotation, which will be considered by the Agency.  Interested parties other than SEI must respond in writing (via mail, email, or fax) demonstrating the offeror's experience and capabilities in parachutes incorporating the Thin-Pack technology and the level of maintenance support required by the Government. Address: Commander Code 210000D, NAWCWD, Attn: William T. Monckton, 1 Administration Circle, Bldg. 20259, China Lake, CA 93555-61000.  RFP is available at https://contracts.nawcwd.navy.mil/rfp-nawc.htm.  Anticipate release date of RFP: July 1, 2002.  Estimate closing date: July 22, 2002.  Anticipated award date: July 29, 2002.

<DESC>This synopsis is issued for informational and planning purposes only.  The Air Force is conducting market research and desires input from industry to help in requirements planning.  The information requested by this synopsis will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency.  Please note that the Air Force will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this request for information.  The Air Force is researching the feasibility and cost effectiveness of commercial solutions and state of the art technology to meet current and projected information system requirements.  In considering new system solutions, the Air Force must give careful consideration to successful transition and migration from existing legacy systems to preclude a lapse in or degradation of services provided to our many DoD customers.  

INTRODUCTION:  The present Airlift Services Industrial Fund Integrated Computer System (ASIFICS) provides for data collection, customer billing, accounts receivable, and reports to AMCs diverse airlift customers.  ASIFICS is a highly integrated information system that is menu-driven and utilizes ORACLE.   It is a relational oriented system which requires use of antiquated methods for accomplishing system modifications and upgrades needed to meet the changing Air Force Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) requirements.  The present system lacks the flexibility needed to support AMCs current and projected financial management requirements.  
PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:  ASIFICS is a specialized one-of-a-kind subsidiary ledger that processes Transportation Data producing a bill for the airlift customer served within six business areas (Passenger Movement, Shipment Units, Special Assignment Airlift, Contingency, Exercise and Training, Frequency Channel Billing) using multiple variables set to code based on business rules and the budget. The accounts receivable data derived by ASIFICS is eventually fed into Air Force approved accounting systems.  Additionally, ASIFICS performs accounting, budgeting, and analysis functions necessary for the financial management of the Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF).  The ASIFICS application as it exists today is non-GUI menu driven utilizing a non-relational database consisting of (flat files) Oracle Tables.  When upgrades/changes are needed any number of tables may require modification adding to the complexity, timeliness of the change, cost and overall maintenance of the system.  The Air Force desires a technology solution that would eliminate the latter and apply cutting edge technology enabling rapid maintenance/upgrades increasing efficiencies and customer ease of use while decreasing overall costs.  The Air Force would envision the replacement system to use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) interface between forms and a relational database approach via web-browser in addition to performing the accounts receivables, budgeting and analysis in compliance with the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, Public Law 101-576 regulatory guidance.  Safeguards must be in place to ensure the security and integrity of operations and data.  
PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS/NEEDS:  ASIFICS is a comprehensive information management system that supports accounting, budgeting, and analysis functions necessary for the financial management of the HQ AMC (Headquarters Air Mobility Command) Airlift Service.  This system performs the critical functions of data collection, revenue computation, billing, accounts receivable, maintenance, tariff schedules, analytical reports, accounts aging, disputed billing research, financial statement preparation, accrual accounting, budget execution, and additional functions required by HQ AMC/FM (Financial Management Directorate).  ASIFICS is an integrated accounting and budgeting system that supports and manages transportation revenue created when AMC provides airlift services to DOD customers.  ASIFICS, along with GAFS (General Accounting and Finance Systems), is the official accounting system for the Headquarters Air Mobility Command (HQ AMC).  As a result, ASIFICS must provide a General Ledger transaction file for recording daily revenue to interface with the other accounting systems.  ASIFICS collects approximately $3.5 Billion in TWCF revenue annually.    As ASIFICS is a highly specialized financial management system, it employs numerous financial database and software applications that furnish information for AMC Commanders for mission and operation decisions.  Listed are some of the key software applications that are currently required:
	Software Application:

-           Transaction history that complies with federal accounting standards
-	Audit Trails provided
-	Systems provide accurate and complete documentation 
-	Proper configuration control for standard internal and external reporting
-	Detailed reconciliation of general ledge and subsidiary ledger
-	Accurate corrections controls and efficient system design
-	Test and evaluate controls should provided reasonable assurance that the data processed through the information system results in complete, valid, and reliable data.
-	Achieve database standardization and a system software suite that is compliant with built in customer service assurance and security features
-	Provide a web-based architecture
-	Provide data integrity 
-	Eliminate the long-term staffing risk factor for future maintenance caused by programming languages
-	Maintenance is faster and easier based on the standardized relational database design
-	Interface with data standard systems

WORKLOAD DATA: Historical workload data shows AFISICS transactions of approximately $1.8  Million per annum as follows

	BUSINESS AREA				TRANSACTIONS

1.	Passenger Movement			   295,824.0
2.	Shipment Units				 1,088,880.0
3.	Special Assignment Airlift		    55,020.0
4.	Contingency				   289,872.0	
5.	Exercise and Training			     1,476.0
6.	Frequency Channel Billing		    93,564.0
TOTAL ASIFICS TRANSACTIONS    			 1,824,636.0

INFORMATION REQUESTED:  Contractors interested in assisting the Air Force with our market research activities are requested to submit the following information in the format of a White Paper as outlined below.  The white paper should be concise (no more than 10 pages) and address only the information requested below.  Again, this information will support market research activities within the Air Force.  Any resultant Air Force requirement for this system will be addressed in a subsequent synopsis announcement.  
I.	Company Information (General):  
II.	Past Performance Information (Specific):  Identify system solutions that you have provided to either DoD specific or other commercial customers that are considered to be very similar to the ASIFICS requirements outlined in this synopsis.  For each project referenced, include the name of the customer, a point of contact (include their phone number and e-mail address), and a brief description of the technology solution delivered.  These references must be recent, within the last 3 years.
III.	Capabilities (General):  Generally describe your companys commercial systems solutions that may fulfill the Air Forces ASIFICS requirements. The Air Force is not asking for disclosure of specific or detailed innovative solutions here.  The Air Force is merely interested in the availability of existing commercial technology solutions which could replace the current legacy system in a way that is transparent to our DoD customers.  
IV.	Rough Estimate of Cost and Schedule:  Provide an estimate (or range) of estimated costs for the new system (to include installation, implementation, and transition costs from the existing system).  Also provide separately the anticipated costs for system configuration management and maintenance (hardware/software) over a five-year period.  A timeline for system delivery and transition is also requested.  Timeline should begin with the date of contract award.   
V.	Identify Major Risks:  Provide general information as to the major risks anticipated in conversion to your new system given our existing legacy system.  (Performance/Cost/Schedule).
VI.	Any Other Information Deemed Useful to the Air Force. 

SUBMISSION INFORMATION: Interested contractors should continue to check the FBO website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ for additional information.  The White Paper should be submitted by 22 Jul 02 via E-mail to Barbara.Odom@scott.af.mil with a copy furnished to Susan.Madison@scott.af.mil.  Please refer any questions via e-mail to Barbara.Odom@scott.af.mil, phone 618-256-9959 with a copy furnished to Susan.Madison@scott.af.mil, phone 618-256-9965.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  
NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS. ? 
The Marine Corps Systems Command is conducting a survey of potential sources for single or multiple Weapons and Sensor systems that can provide a 360-degree field of fire and be utilized on riverine craft.    The request is for off the shelf, or nearly off the shelf, systems that can be effectively utilized onboard a future concept riverine craft variant that will provide armed escort and command and control during riverine operations.  System development should be complete and ready for production craft integration in FY 2004.  Notional craft characteristics are small (<40 ft long, ~9 ft beam), open, diesel engine powered craft.

The objective of the weapon system is to increase effectiveness (primarily accuracy and lethality) compared to current mounted, manned medium and heavy machine gun systems in use (0.50 caliber, M240G and 40 mm grenade launcher).  The objective of the sensor system would be to improve detection and location of enemy forces in areas of riverine operations.

Interest is in a system that fires standard sized small arms and light weapons munitions and in both stabilized and non-stabilized mounts.  Additionally, information is requested for sensor systems such as, thermal, night vision, optical sighting, video auto tracking, and acoustic detection and triangulation. 

For both weapons and sensors systems the following information is requested:  system description, system maturity, compatibility with marine environment, weight, dimensions, system and any non-reoccurring engineering costs, required power, and required craft interfaces.  Provide weapons information on the type of munitions fired, firing rate, munitions feed method, method of firing (e.g. manual, remote/manual, automatic), effective range of weapon, method of fire control (e.g. manual, remote, stabilized, non-stabilized), accuracy, and arc of fire.  Provide sensor information on method of detection, effective range, field of view and other sensor specific performance parameters.  The offeror may provide information on a weapon, sensor or integrated system.  

Please include the willingness of the company to participate in a demonstration of their product.    MARCORSYSCOM will not pay or provide reimbursement for any costs incurred in the preparation of delivery of the request information.  Industry firms capable of providing the required systems, in whole or in part, are invited to submit a response to this notice.  Firms should identify/submit a copy of their GSA schedule, if applicable.  Firms should also include literature, brochures, price lists, and capabilities summaries directly addressing their ability to meet the aforementioned needs.   Interested firms are requested to respond NLT 31 July 02, stating their business size, NAICS Code, and identifying a corporate point of contact. Interested sources should respond to: (U. S. Mail address) Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command, ATTN CT-JC, 2033 Barnett Ave., Suite 315, Quantico, VA 22134-5010. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.

<SUBJECT>--Joint Service Chemical Environment Survivability Mask
<DESC>NA DESC: This announcement is re-issued in order to correct the inter-net address where the Draft Performance Specification and the Draft Statement of Work will be posted.  The original announcement was posted on Monday, June 24, 2002. The Department of Defen se (DOD) has a requirement to develop a lightweight, single use emergency mask for use in low Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) threat conditions and in military medical care situations where the use of the issued NBC protective mask is not practical  as described in the Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the JSCESM.  The Government anticipates the JSCESM will be a modified commercial item, meeting the JSCESM requirements. The mask components will be optimized to minimize weight and bulk while  maximizing wearer performance and the ability to interface with Service protective equipment, communications systems and optical display and sighting systems. The applicable NAICS Code for this acquisition is 339113          with a size standard of 500 em ployees. To meet the schedule and performance objectives for the JSCESM, the program will focus on identifying a commercial item that can be modified to meet the requirements of the ORD, which have been set forth in a performance specification. The JSCESM program will be initiated with a Milestone B to enter the System Demonstration phase. Initially, the Government intends to issue a solicitation on a full and open competitive basis to acquire up to 100 prototypes from mask manufacturers.  The government th en intends to conduct testing and evaluation of these prototypes to assess how well the product meets the thresholds and best satisfies the objective requirements of the performance specification with emphasis on the key performance parameters. The evaluat ion is expected to also include human factors, cost and past performance.  Based on the results of this evaluation, the Government anticipates issuing a separate solicitation and limiting competition to those manufacturers that can best satisfy its needs.   Secondly, a limited competition will be conducted with the manufacture(s) who the government has determined can best satisfy its needs.  Evaluation is expected to be based on an offeror’s ability to meet the key performance parameters, human factors, sch edule, cost and past performance.  The government’s intent is to award one contract, through as a result of the limited competition, which .  This contract  will cover the System Demonstration phase and include an option for production.  A draft Statement of Work and Performance Specification, as well as other pertinent information, identified with draft Request for Proposal (RFP) No. DAAD13-02-R- 0031 will be posted on or about June  28,2002 at the following web site address https://abop.monmouth.army.mil,  by selecting Army solicitations from the Robert Morris Acquisition Center, clicking on the Go Button and selecting the draft RFP titled Joint Service Chemical Environment Survivability Mask.  A pre-solicitation conference Industry Day is scheduled for Jul y 11, 2002 at the Comfort Inn, 1700 Van Bibber Rd, Edgewood, MD (410) 679-2997. The intent of this conference is for the government to present a brief overview of the JSCESM program to include program objectives, milestones/schedules, procurement approach,  and users' concerns and to answer questions from prospective offerors. If desired, industry representatives may present information on their product in an open forum or there will also be the opportunity for a one-on-one (single company) session with gove rnment representatives to discuss or brief government personnel on their in-house efforts.   The government is soliciting comments on the draft statement of work and performance specification and encourages comments and supporting rationale as to what indu stry envisions as the primary cost drivers and the ability to modify existing commercial products, as well as any questions relating to the requirements.  Pre-r egistration for this conference is mandatory and shall include the following information: contractor's name; complete   mailing address; point of contact to include voice/data telephone number and e-mail address; preliminary questions relating to the acqui sition; and confirmation as to whether a presentation  (open forum or one-on-one) is desired.
