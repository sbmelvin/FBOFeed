<SUBJECT>Architect-Engineering Services, Indefinite Delivery Contract, Not-To-Exceed $9.5M for the US Army Corps of Engineers Far East District in Seoul Korea
<SOLNBR>W912UM-17-R-0005
<RESPDATE>030317
<CONTACT>Daniel E. Shin, Phone 7216110, Email daniel.e.shin@usace.army.mil
<DESC>SYNOPSIS:
<p>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION <br />This Indefinite Delivery multi-discipline contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks Act (Public Law 92-582), as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6, for A-E services to be performed for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Far East District (FED) throughout the Korean Peninsula. This is an unrestricted Brooks Act acquisition open to firms of all sizes. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on required demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work, stated herein.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award up to two (2) Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IDCs), each with a maximum dollar amount of $4,750,000 with an ordering period of one (1) base year and one (1) option period for a possible total of two (2) years. The Government guarantees award of services valued at not less than $2,500 ("minimum guarantee amount") over the course of the ordering period. Services will be obtained through negotiated firm-fixed-price task orders against the IDCs resulting from this solicitation/synopsis. Individual task orders may be issued up to a maximum dollar value of $1,500,000.</p>
<p><br />2. PROJECT INFORMATION<br />The IDCs resulting from this solicitation may be used primarily (but will not be limited) to support the Yongsan and Combined Forces Command (CFC) Residual Programs, and the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense System (THAAD) to the Republic of Korea (ROK). The CFC Residual Program may involve construction or alteration of new or existing facilities currently located at the Yongsan Garrison, Seoul, ROK and utilized for command and control of combined U.S./ROK military forces engaged in the defense of the ROK. Design and construction of the CFC Residual Program facilities will likely take place at the same time as significant transformation and/or removal of existing Yongsan Garrison facilities is taking place in order to implement ROK plans to repurpose and transform the area in Seoul in which the Yongsan Garrison currently exists. Design and construction/alteration of CFC Residual Program facilities may proceed simultaneously with dynamic changes to master plans, siting, utilities and communications requirements at the Yongsan Garrison.</p>
<p>For the THAAD system, A-E contractor designs may be required to construct facilities in order to obtain Full Operational Capability (FOC) for the THAAD system. FOC facilities may be either Temporary, Semi-permanent, or Permanent construction to provide for sustained operation of the system at the tactical site. The scope of A-E work for FOC facilities may include design of: utilities, munitions storage, commercial power upgrades, road improvements, fuel facilities, storage, billeting and permanent security fencing.</p>
<p>Potential project requirements will be located at various U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine bases/camps/installations within the ROK. Typical design services that may be required include: cost estimating, design, planning, engineering studies, site investigations, environmental surveys and assessments, geotechnical surveys and reports, utility system and traffic studies and reports, preparation of DD Form 1391s, planning and design charrettes, A-E services during construction, and other general engineering activities, often of a military nature. The A-E firm(s) selected for negotiation of IDCs should have sufficient staff, flexibility and capability to fulfill design and engineering requirements on an as-needed basis, to be issued through task order solicitations. Given the classified nature of some of the facilities and projects anticipated, A-E firm applicants will be required to possess an approved U.S. Government Facility Clearance at the time they submit their qualifications statements.</p>
<p>The CFC Residual Program, the THAAD System deployment program and other design requirements may require the design of new military facilities, utility systems, and roads; and/or repairs, renovation, modification, or conversion of existing facilities, utility systems, and roads. Typical types of military facilities that are likely to be the subject of design services requirements include training facilities; administrative buildings; unaccompanied military housing; dining facilities; medical/dental clinics; communications facilities; fuel storage and dispensing facilities; religious and family, morale, welfare, and recreation facilities; athletic facilities; airfield structures; ammunition storage bunkers; vehicle maintenance facilities; roads &amp; sidewalks; and utility systems that may include communications, power, water, gas, and sewers. Force protection measures, such as blast hardening, Collective Protection System (CPS) and Chemical Biological Radiological (CBR) protection are likely to be required for some facilities. Sustainable Design/LEED and Energy Policy Act 2005 requirements will be required for new facilities and may be required for renovation of existing facilities. Designs must be based on current technical criteria listed in UFC 1-200-01, DoD Building Code (General Building Requirements) or UFC 1-201-01, Non-Permanent DoD Facilities In Support Of Military Operations (where applicable), supplemented with additional criteria as indicated in individual task orders. Design deliverables should include approved local materials and construction methods that are compliant with U.S. standards and code criteria in order to facilitate the use of local methods and materials. Designs and prepared drawings must be accomplished using Computer-Added Design (CAD) and Building Information Modelling (BIM) and must comply with the current A/E/C CAD standard available from the CAD/BIM Technology Center, USACE Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC). Construction contracts resulting from required design services may be awarded by either the FED or Host Nation agencies, which will require design documents to be prepared in both the English and Korean languages. Cost estimates must be prepared using the Corps of Engineers Micro Computer Aided Cost Estimating System (MCACES)-Second Generation (MII), for which software and training will be provided by the FED. Project cost estimates for construction contracts to be awarded by host nation agencies, primarily the ROK Ministry of National Defense (MND), will be required to be prepared in the detailed format prescribed by the host nation agency. These estimates are extremely detailed and require a level of effort not typically required of most construction cost estimates. The details of these requirements will be included in the Scope of Work distributed with the RFP to the most highly qualified A-E firms.</p>
