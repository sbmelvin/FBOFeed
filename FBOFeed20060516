<DESC>This is a Presolicitation Notice for the upcoming project,Testing of Sexual Violence Definitions and Recommended Data Elements in Three Different Racial/Ethnic Minority Communities." This RFP will be based upon information gained from the Basile & Saltzman, 2002 for the National and State Based Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual Violence Surveillance Survey.

I. Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to use a comprehensive sexual violence (SV) survey tool (developed from Basile & Saltzman, 2002 for the National and State Based Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual Violence Surveillance Survey) to learn more about SV victimization prevalence, characteristics, circumstances, and help seeking behavior among English and/or Spanish speaking male and female adult (18 years and older) members of three different racial/ethnic minority populations, such as, but not limited to, African Americans, Hispanics, and American Indian/Alaska Natives. If feasible, this project will also examine rural versus urban differences within or outside of the racial/ethnic minority populations selected. 

For the purpose of this project, SV is defined as nonconsensual completed or attempted penetration, unwanted non-penetrative sexual contact (e.g. unwanted touching of private areas of the body), or non-contact acts such as verbal sexual harassment, by any perpetrator.

Approximately three different communities or geographic areas will be sampled to reach the racial/ethnic and rural populations of interest for this project. For the purpose of this project, a community/geographic area is defined as a city, metropolitan area, or region of a county.

II. Background and Need

There is little known about the prevalence and characteristics of SV among underserved populations, such as racial/ethnic minorities or rural populations. This survey will be one of few detailed examinations of SV among these communities and will be used to learn more about the SV victimization of underserved communities.

III INFORMATION

The RFP is anticipated for release on or about June 01, 2006. Interested parties are advised to register to this notice to receive all subsequent announcements on this RFP.

<ARCHDATE>06302006
<CONTACT>Steve Manley, 202-385-8676
<DESC>On April 6, 2006, the FAA posted a public announcement advising industry that FAA intends to develop a NAS wide acquisition program for Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B), Traffic Information Service - Broadcast (TIS-B), and Flight Information Service - Broadcast (FIS-B) services with a goal of an "in-service decision" by 2010. This second announcement is a request for patent information.   The FAA has an interest in obtaining information regarding ADS-B, TIS-B, and FIS-B existing patents, in-process patents, and patents currently under litigation.  Industry responses, except those under litigation, will be publicized in a future announcement in order to facilitate teaming discussions and to contribute to FAA's understanding of the current state of the industry.  FAA will not validate, endorse, or research any of the responses.  None of the responses will be used for any form of evaluation during the acquisition.       Responses are to be in a matrix format showing the patent number and enough title information to show the substance of the patent including the respective application such as TIS-B, ADS-B, or FIS-B.    The information is to be submitted to FAA by COB 6/1/06.  Electronic submission is preferred by either E-mail to Steve.Manley@faa.gov or delivery of electronic media via mail to the following addresses.   U.S. Mail responses:   Federal Aviation Administration ATTN:  Steve Manley (ATO-A 320) 800 Independence Avenue S.W.  Washington, D.C. 20519 Express Mail (FEDEX/DHL, etc.):  Federal Aviation Administration ATTN:  Steve Manley (Room 5-B-33) 600 Independence Avenue S.W.  Washington, D.C. 20519 E-mail confirmations of all submissions other than those by E-mail are to be sent to: "Steve.Manley@faa.gov" As stated in the April 6, 2006 announcement, the FAA's Surveillance and Broadcast Services Office (ATO-E) proposes to obtain FAA approval of the acquisition program in early June, 2006.  After program approval, an industry symposium is planned at FAA Headquarters June 19 - June 22 where a program summary will be presented to all participants.  Individual discussion sessions with vendors are also planned.  Industry presentations may also be considered.  The symposium may be delayed depending on completion of the FAA JRC review.   FAA is interested in industry suggestions regarding pricing structures, technical approaches, and performance incentives/penalties.  As guided by the FAA Acquisition Management System, maximum participation by industry early on in the acquisition process is encouraged.   The April 6, 2006 announcement may be accessed through the Archives contained on the FAA contract opportunities website, WWW.FAA.Gov "aboutFAA".

<DESC>Screening Information Request (SIR) for the Architectural/Engineering/Contractor Design and Construction Modernization of the Airport Traffic Control Tower at Olympia Regional Airport Olympia, Washington. Point of Contact: Laura Coonce, Contract Administrator, 425-227-2861                              Clarence Davis, Contracting Officer, 425-227-2938 The purpose of this SIR is to seek competent and qualified contractors to do a Design/Build Modernization of the Airport Traffic Control Tower at the Olympia Regional Airport (OLM) in Olympia, Washington.  This SIR is a 100% set-aside for Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB) (8a). DESCRIPTION OF WORK: Work includes all professional architectural, engineering and other related technical services, labor, materials and equipment and construction services as well as providing a separate manufactured building to be used as a workspace, which encompasses approximately 300 square feet. The ATCT is a high security area.  All contractor personnel must successfully pass security clearance requirements before being allowed on site. The estimated dollar value is between $500,000.00 - $1,000,000.00 EVALUATION: For this procurement, the FAA has appointed an Integrated Product Team (IPT) who will evaluate all responses received.  A point value system has been assigned to each of the criteria listed separately in Phase I and Phase II.  Each of the six considerations of Phase I carries a separate weighted factor.  For Phase I accumulative point total will lead to the down selection of no more than three firms.  Phase Two will select one firm for completion of the project.   PHASE I: All responsible offerors must submit qualifications for consideration in Phase One.  The IPT will utilize the following criteria in descending order of importance: 1. Contractor has worked on a FAA ATCT, TRACON, or ARTCC. 2. Architect/Engineers/General Contractor relationship on at least 2 previous jobs unless the engineers are part of the sub-contractor's company or design team is local (within 35 miles of OLM) and is accessible to superintendent. 3. Contractor can provide an on-site superintendent with at least 5 years experience as a superintendent. 4. Contractor's project manager has at least 5 years experience and has worked on at least 3 federal government projects. 5.  Contractor has completed at least 3 projects in the last 5 years in the $500,000 to $1,000,000 dollar range. 6.  Contractor has adequate finances to accomplish job. SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS: Offerors must submit proposals on Phase One by May 30th, 2006.  The IPT will take approximately 1 week to review proposals.  The result of the IPT evaluation will be the selection of no more than three firms with the highest overall point score that are deemed to be qualified as the Design/Build offerors most likely to receive an award and ultimately provide the FAA the best value. PHASE II:  Applies to the selected offerors (no more than 3) from Phase I.  Proposals shall consist of a schematic design with a firm fixed price for the entire Design/Build effort.  The schematic design should be thorough enough to show that all FAA requirements will be met and the firm fixed price is reliable.  The IPT will utilize a point value system for each of the five considerations listed below.  Each consideration carries a separate weighted factor in descending order of importance: 1.  Cost 2.  Design team and contractor demonstrated relationship. 3.  Key personnel qualifications.  4.  Proposed schedule. 5.  Understanding of project. Phase II proposals are due on or about July 7th, 2006.  The IPT will then make a final offeror selection in 2 weeks.

Summary of the Acquisition Strategy:  The contract will be Firm Fixed-Price and Source Selection procedures under FAR Part 15 will be employed as the method of selection of the successful Offeror.  Proposals will be evaluated using a Two-Stage process. Technical factors, when combined, are more important than cost or price.  Under Stage I, offerors must submit information regarding qualifications, past performance and personnel.  The technical proposals will be evaluated based on pre-established evaluation factors and short listing will be established.  Those offerors who are short listed will be provided with the Stage II RFP, which will include a detailed scope of services, the preliminary housing plan and other information needed to submit an offer.  Firms that respond to the RFP will be required in Stage II to submit pricing in accordance with FAR 15.403 and the RFP.  Short listed firms will be required to provide oral presentations in Ft. Worth, TX using proposed team members.  The contract may be awarded on the basis of the Stage II submissions or the Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) may request Final Revised Proposals.  If discussions are conducted, offerors will be advised in accordance with FAR 15.306(d)(3) of technical deficiencies and significant weaknesses noted by the technical advisors and the SSEB.  The Government reserves the right to make an award based on Stage II proposals without holding discussions or conducting negotiations.  The method for the proposal evaluation will be the "best value" method, with the technical proposal (including all factors) more important than price.  After technical and price evaluations, discussions and/or negotiations and Final Revised Proposals (FRP), if required, the SSEB will make recommendation to the Source Selection Authority (SSA) of the Offeror whose offer is most advantageous to the Government.  Source Selection Evaluation Criteria:  The following criteria represent the factors that will be used by GSA's SSEB 
In evaluating offerors potential as viable competitors.  
The evaluation factors for Stage I are as follows:  (1) Past Performance in Providing General Construction Services and Pre-construction Services on Similar Projects; (2) Experience in Providing General Construction Services and Pre-construction Services on Similar Projects and (3) Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel.  The evaluation factors for Stage II are as follows:  (1) Project Management Plan:  The Project Management Plan will include such information as project staffing, communication, safety plan, coordination, quality control plan, scheduling, monitoring/controlling costs, problem resolution and utilization of "sustainable" methods and materials in construction, etc.  (2) Subcontracting Plan:  provide a subcontracting plan indicating subcontracting opportunities for small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, woman-owned small business, veteran and disabled veteran-owned business, 8(a) small business and HUB Zone small business to participate in this contract.  A subcontracting plan must be provided with the proposal.  Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.  Price Range:  The estimated range of construction cost is $60,000,000 to $70,000,000.  Congress is expected to furnish construction funds for this project by FY 2009.  A Pre-proposal conference to discuss the scope requirements will be held in Austin at a location and a time determined later.

<DESC>CONTACT Michael E. Harris, Senior Logistics Engineer, 732-532-2453. This is a broad, community-specific market survey to locate sources for supply of numerous avionics items that are currently in short supply within the Army and are needed immediatel y to support Army Aviation. In many cases, OEM suppliers are unable to produce sufficient quantities to meet our current needs. Thus, we are interested in buying assets from alternative sources. Depending upon specific circumstances for the items in questi on, we might be interested in buying new stock, new old stock, reconditioned items, or, in some cases, unserviceable items. In some cases, this material may have been purchased by suppliers as surplus equipment.  Depending upon respondents capabilities an d the current status of our organic depot repair programs, we might be interested in having the supplier perform refurbishment / repair / overhaul.  Alternatively, we might want to buy the unserviceable assets and induct these into ongoing organic repair p rograms that are operating below capacity because of the longstanding paucity of unserviceable returns from the field.  Regardless of specific circumstances, any company that possesses ANY significant quantity of Army avionics is encouraged to respond with  information regarding those assets that they have available. We have a list of key NSNs of interest that will be provided via e-mail upon request. We are looking for hardware assets, not repair services. Companies capable of performing this effort may res pond by writing to: Commander, USA CECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-CCS-N-AN (MICHAEL E. HARRIS), Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5403 or alternatively, contact us via e-mail at: EMAIL ADDRESS avionics@mail1.monmouth.army.mil.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to purchase a Rapid Quench Flow 3 Instrument from KinTek 7604 Sandia Loop, Suite C, Austin, TX 78735.  This instrument is water-jacketed, three syringe drive unit, and sample loading valves allowing reactions to be performed with <20µl per sample per shot and providing >95% recovery of samples.  The system includes a computer-controlled servo motor drive and software, allowing programmed reaction times ranging from 2 milliseconds to 100 seconds or longer.    The following specifications shall be included in the system:  1) Motor Drive: A computer-controlled servo motor drive provides precise and reproducible setting of the reaction times.  The motor is digitally-controlled with 4096 points per revolution with resolver feedback for precise positioning.  A high torque, low inertia, brushless motor and high performance, digital power supply provides essentially instantaneous starts and stops of the drive syringes; 2) Computer Control:  The volumes of reaction loops are stored in the computer in non-volatile memory.  During an experiment, the operator simply enters the reaction time of interest and the computer sets up the drive motor to control the drive pulse sequence;  3) Sealed Keyboard:  A sealed keyboard with a two-line display provides a convenient user interface for entering reaction parameters.  The hemetically sealed keyboard can be easily washed to eliminate contamination by acids or radioactivity; 4) Vertically Mounted Syringe/Valve chamber:  A single chamber contains the drive syringes and valve systems.

<CONTACT>JOHN J. NANARTOWICZ, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 202-564-4756, E-Mail: nanartowicz.john@epa.gov
<DESC>THIS REQUIREMENT WILL BE PROCURED AS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE COMPETITIVE ACTION.  THE APPLICABLE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES!! BACKGROUND: The Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development established the National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT)  in 2005 to research the utility of computational chemistry, high-throughput screening (HTS) and various toxicogenomic technologies for Agency use in chemical prioritization, quantitative risk assessment and biological modeling. As part of this, the NCCT is developing computational tools for interpreting data from these technologies to classify chemicals, predict toxicity, and prioritize limited testing resources towards chemicals and endpoints that present the greatest risk to human health and the environment. Thus a chemical prioritization research program, entitled ToxCast, is being initiated with the purpose of developing the ability to predict, or forecast toxicity.  The proof-of-concept phase of ToxCast will focus upon chemicals with a rich toxicological database (e.g., registered pesticide actives), in order to provide an interpretive context. Following this proof-of-concept, the ToxCast program will move on to other environmental chemicals domains relevant to EPA. The ToxCast program will evaluate chemical properties and effects across a broad spectrum of information domains: physical-chemical properties, predicted biological activities based on existing structure-activity models, biochemical properties based on HTS assays, cell based phenotypic assays, and genomic and metabolomic analyses of cells.  SCOPE: Much of the data in these various domains will be generated through a series of seven (7) integrated Performance Work Statements (PWS). The contracts that will be awarded from these PWS will be essential components of the ToxCast program over the next five years, providing data populating the various domains that can be interpretively linked to known or predicted toxicological properties of environmental chemicals. This Request for Proposals (RFP) (# PR-HQ-06-14395) will be soliciting proposals for five (5) of the seven (7) PWS that make up the laboratory services requirement of the ToxCast Program.  Potential offerors and interested parties should visit the EPA website to review all documents that relate to the program and these procurements.  The EPA website is  at: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/adm_placement/prhq0614395/prhq0614395.htm  The five (5) performance work statements under this RFP are SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS competition.   It should be noted that hard copies of the RFP will not be mailed out, but will be available for down-loading from the EPA website along with all associated and supporting documents. Email the Contracting Officer at "nanartowicz.john@epa.gov" to express your interest in this solicitation package.  Please include in your e-mail your firms complete name and address for Source List purposes.  Due to the anticipated large volume of interest, we will be unable to return phone calls or respond to e-mail inquiries for these procurements.  You may be able to retrieve a copy of the RFP package on or about June 1, 2006.

<DESC>This solicitation is the second issued for the TOXCAST PROGRAM by the Headquarters Procurement Operations Division of the Office of Acquisition Management of the U.S. EPA.  THE TWO REQUIREMENTS ADDRESSED IN THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE PROCURED AS FOLLOWS:  FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIVE PROCEDURE for Performance Work Statement (PWS) P#2; and SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE COMPETITIVE PROCEDURE for PWS P#6.   THE APPLICABLE NAICS CODE for the SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES!! BACKGROUND: The Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development established the National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT)  in 2005 to research the utility of computational chemistry, high-throughput screening (HTS) and various toxicogenomic technologies for Agency use in chemical prioritization, quantitative risk assessment and biological modeling. As part of this, the NCCT is developing computational tools for interpreting data from these technologies to classify chemicals, predict toxicity, and prioritize limited testing resources towards chemicals and endpoints that present the greatest risk to human health and the environment. Thus a chemical prioritization research program, entitled ToxCast, is being initiated with the purpose of developing the ability to predict, or forecast toxicity.  The proof-of-concept phase of ToxCast will focus upon chemicals with a rich toxicological database (e.g., registered pesticide actives), in order to provide an interpretive context. Following this proof-of-concept, the ToxCast program will move on to other environmental chemicals domains relevant to EPA. The ToxCast program will evaluate chemical properties and effects across a broad spectrum of information domains: physical-chemical properties, predicted biological activities based on existing structure-activity models, biochemical properties based on HTS assays, cell based phenotypic assays, and genomic and metabolomic analyses of cells.  SCOPE: Much of the data in these various domains will be generated through a series of seven (7) integrated Performance Work Statements (PWS). The contracts that will be awarded from these PWS will be essential components of the ToxCast program over the next five years, providing data populating the various domains that can be interpretively linked to known or predicted toxicological properties of environmental chemicals. This Request for Proposals (RFP) (# PR-HQ-06-14708) will be soliciting proposals for two (2) of the seven (7) PWS that make up the laboratory services requirement of the ToxCast Program.  Potential offerors and interested parties should visit the EPA website to review all documents that relate to the program and these procurements.  The EPA website is  at: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/adm_placement/prhq0614395/prhq0614395.htm   The two (2) performance work statements under this RFP will be procured using the following methods: FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for P#2; SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE for P#6.  It should be noted that hard copies of the RFP will not be mailed out, but will be available for down-loading from the EPA website along with all associated and supporting documents. Email the Contracting Officer at "nanartowicz.john@epa.gov" to express your interest in this solicitation package.  Please include in your e-mail your firms complete name and address for Source List purposes.  Due to the anticipated large volume of interest, we will be unable to return phone calls or respond to e-mail inquiries for these procurements.  You may be able to retrieve a copy of the RFP package on or about June 5, 2006.

<DESC>The EPA Region III, in Phila. PA has a policy aimed at improving air quality and reducing traffic congestion by offering employees incentives to commute to and from work using public transportation.  The Federal Employees Clean Air Incentives Act (FECAIA), 5 U.S.C. ? 7905, allows agencies to establish programs which would encourage employees to use mass transit to commute to and from work.  The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC.)  It was established as a Interstate Compact between NJ and PA in order to facilitate planning and transit issues between the states. The Commuter Benefit Program is the name of the transit voucher system which was established to simplify employer/employee transit subsidy programs and promote pollution reduction and energy savings.  EPA anticipates sole-source negotiations with DVRPC in accordance with FAR 13.5 and FAR 6.302.1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the Agency?s requirement. To meet the objectives of the FECAIA, EPA Region III, anticipates a 5 year indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract for transit checks which are usable on SEPTA, NJ Transit, Patco, DART/DAST, Amtrak, PAT, CAT, BARTA, as well as approved and authorized vanpools.  Contract line items will consist of varying denominations of transit checks.  The checks must have a preprinted amount, security features, and be usable on the above listed transit systems.  Delivery is expected to be 2 weeks after receipt of delivery order.  Quotations (TransitCheks) are due no later than 05/19/06, 3:00 PM, Eastern Time to the EPA Region III Reception area on the 1st floor at 1650 Arch Street, Philadelphia, PA.  Quotations must be to the attention of AA Pinero, Jr., 3PM10.  If more information is required on the request for quotation please contact Mr Pinero at (215) 814-5306.

<SUBJECT>10 -- COMMAND AND CONTROL APPLICATIONS (C2 APPS)
<SOLNBR>R1273
<CONTACT>Cindy Lewandowski cindy.lewandowski@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>This is a Request for Information/ Sources Sought Synopsis. Electronics Systems Center, 350th ELSG/PK, is requesting information from companies that have software design/development experience in Command and Control Applications (C2 Apps) for a potential contract that will provide development and associated sustainment of future C2 capabilities.  This new contract is envisioned to support development/sustainment of select capabilities associated with several programs/systems, including (but not necessarily limited to) the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) Weapon System,  Net-Enabled Command Capability (NECC) (formerly known as Joint Command and Control (JC2) Capability) and Unit Level Command and Control (UC2) capability (formerly known as Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS) Unit Level (UL).  More specifically, the C2 Apps contract is envisioned to accommodate the following: (1)	Development and associated sustainment of select AOC WS capabilities that do not logically or easily align with capabilities being provided and/or supported by other third party developers and/or System Program Offices (SPOs).  This would include technology transition/maturation of 3rd party capabilities and innovations that are identified as viable solutions for meeting identified AOC requirements. (2)	Development and associated sustainment of future NECC capability. This would include replacement and/or enhancement of capabilities inherent in the Joint Standard Air Operations Software (JSAOS) baseline, which today is provided as part of the TBMCS Force Level (FL) program.  As the current TBMCS contract with Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems and Solutions (LMIS&S) (contract F19628-95-C-0143) approaches the end of its period of performance, at the end of FY07, the C2 Applications contract will provide continuity in meeting Air Force obligations with respect to Joint Service needs (for instance, with regard to JSAOS) and facilitate development of capabilities required during the transition into the NECC era. (3)	Development, integration, and associated sustainment of future UC2 capabilities.  Again, with the current TBMCS contract with LMIS&S finishing by the end of FY07, the C2 Applications contract will provide continuity in addressing new requirements and capabilities formerly provided by the TBMCS UL efforts. The 350th ELSG/PK is seeking a source or sources for the contemplated C2 Apps contract.  Sources who believe they have the required concepts, tools and core capabilities for C2 Apps are encouraged to provide a white paper detailing core capabilities and/or existing tools that address and /or meet C2 Apps requirements.  The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to support a possible RFP release.  The information received will not obligate the Government in any manner nor will the Government reimburse contractors for any costs associated with submittal of the requested information.  This request does not constitute an Invitation For Bid or a Request For Proposal.  Responses to this notice are due by COB 1 Jun 06.  Respondents should identify their company's name, address, telephone number, point of contact, and whether they are a large or small business. Proprietary information should be clearly marked.  The electronic format may be in Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (PDF) or compatible with Microsoft Office 2003 suite of software.  The white paper response shall not exceed 5 pages, including company information (single sided, sing le line spaced and utilizing Times New Roman font with 12-dot pitch).  All submissions shall be sent only via e-mail to John.Travieso@hanscom.af.mil.  For additional information contact 1Lt Travieso at (781)- 266 -9484 or visit http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil ESC Busin

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUIRED:  Contractor shall furnish all labor, material, equipment, supervision, transportation and management necessary to perform Maintenance Resource Management Training in accordance with the performance work statement.  Services under this contract are required to be performed at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.

Evaluation for award will be Performance-Price Trade-off (PPTO).  Issuance of the solicitation will be on or about 15 February 2006 and will close on or about 16 March 2006.  The solicitation will be available over the Internet only; NO HARD COPIES will be sent.  Follow the links on the EPS website to access the solicitation:  USAF Offices, Air Mobility Command Locations, and 436 CONS, Dover AFB, DE.     Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.  IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS:  Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires that any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contracts shall be submitted in electronic form.  Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system for implementing this statutory requirement.  Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided via the website.  Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.  As of January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and 
certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or to list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA.  Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN.  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is designed to help you gather information you need for the resultant clauses/provisions.  The information you provide in your questionnaire is automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  The questionnaire is not your official ORCA submission; the information reflected in your provisions is the version Contracting will review.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; you then acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.  The POC for this acquisition is Lani L. Lowe (302) 677-5028, Fax (302) 677-2309, email: lani.lowe@dover.af.mil.

<DESC>DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK FOR INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT CONTRACT FOR
THE USAID OFFICE OF FOOD FOR PEACE


A.	BACKGROUND

The Office of Food for Peace (FFP) of the U.S. Agency for International Developments Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA), provides administrative, technical and financial oversight for the Public Law 480 (P.L. 480) Title II program. Title II represents the largest amount of United States Government (USG) resources committed to global food insecurity, providing over $7 billion of assistance since 2001. FFP makes available Title II resources to private voluntary organizations (PVOs), international organizations (IO), primarily the World Food Program (WFP), and foreign governments to address food insecurity resulting from short term emergencies and longer term development problems in food deficit countries. 

Title II programs operate in an environment characterized by increased frequency and severity of natural and manmade disasters; the heightened diplomatic, military and humanitarian demands on the U.S., including the war on terrorism; and the destabilizing potential of HIV/AIDS, conflict, and increased numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons. 

Under the new FFP Strategy Plan for 2006-2010 (www.usaid.gov/hum_response/ffp), FFP has expanded its basic food security conceptual framework to make explicit the risks (economic, social, health and political risks as well as natural shocks) that impede progress toward improvements in food availability, access and utilization.  

Efforts to improve the measurement of Title II impact will continue under the new strategy.  This will include activities to assess the impact of the program on the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) goal to reduce the prevalence of underweight children under five and improve the measures of food access and community coping capacity.  FFP will also put more emphasis on knowledge management under the new strategy, expanding its knowledge of what works and why and using this knowledge to influence policy and improve program impact in the field.  Under the new strategy, Title II programs will fall into one of two categories:  Single-Year Assistance Programs (SYAPs) or Multi-Year Assistance Programs (MYAPs) (www.usaid.gov/hum_response/ffp).  

B.	OVERALL OBJECTIVES

The contractor shall assist FFP to achieve its strategic objective through the realization of the following objectives: 

Objective 1: 	Provide administrative, technical, and program support in the planning, implementation, management, monitoring and evaluation of Public Law (P.L.) 480 Title II SYAPs and MYAPs. 

Objective 2:  	Provide technical support to the Program Operations Division for calls forward, procurement tracking, booking, shipping, budget analysis and presentations.

Objective 3:	Support the review, administrative, monitoring and evaluation process for FFPs Institutional Support Assistance programs to Cooperating Sponsors (CS).

Objective 4:	Support the planning, organization, and follow-up actions to the Food Aid Consultative Working Group.

Objective 5: 	Assist FFP to develop a standard training package and help modify or develop technical training modules and facilitate training sessions related to P.L. 480 Title II food aid program implementation, monitoring and evaluation. 			 

Objective 6: 	Provide administrative and information support in the areas of report writing and material updates, as well as modify (or develop) and implement a public relations, communication and outreach strategy for FFP.  

Objective 7: 	Provide operational support. 



C.       CONTRACT TYPE

Five year firm fixed-price contract with option years, performance based-contracting

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Dr. Hans Graber, pr ofessor of Applied Marine Physics at University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, leads a team from academia, federal agencies, and the private sector, to provide real-time forecasting of winds, waves, and surge in tropical st orms.  As part of the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP), Dr. Graber's team developed a highly sophisticated hurricane forecasting system that is fully operational and currently used by the National Hurricane Center, Kennedy Space Center, an d the US Navy.  Supercomputers are used by Dr. Graber's team to integrate wind, wave, and surge models to produce a comprehensive hurricane forecast that is considered the most sophisticated and reliable system available.  Critical components of the NOPP f orecasting system are proprietary to NOPP.  Their forecasts of winds, waves, and water level elevations in Lake Pontchartrain resulting from tropical storms will be used by the New Orleans District for the hurricane season commencing June 1, 2006.  These w ind and water level predictions are essential to the operation plan for the interim closure structures at 17th Street, Orleans Avenue, and London Avenue Canals.   This is an Urgent and Compelling requirement under the authority of FAR 5.202-(a)(2).  This notice of intent is not a request for quotations and a determination has been made by the Government not to compete this procurement due to its proprietary nature a nd urgency.

<DESC>After an in-depth review of the RFI responses and the current methodology behind Solicitation BPD-05-R-0063, it has been deemed necessary to consider each category of security services as stand alone categories. THEREFORE, THERE WILL BE NO SOLICITATION ISSUED UNDER BPD-05-R-0063. The creation of separate solicitations for each category will allow for a more focused approach in getting the desired end products for FedSource. By separating the categories, FedSource will be able to create more detailed requirements and will benefit from Contractors that specialize in particular categories of Security Services. The breakdown of security services anticipated for the proposed solicitations are as follows: Category I-Task Order Development; Category II-Security/Safety Consulting and Training Services; Category III-Security Operations Support Services; Category IV-Armed and Unarmed Guard Services; Category V-Personnel Security. IT IS ENVISIONED THE FIRST SOLICITATION UNDER THIS NEW PROCESS WILL NOT BE ISSUED UNTIL AT LEAST THE FIRST QUARTER OF FY 2007. Therefore, we recommend that you monitor FedBizOpps for all information relevant to these future acquisitions. NO TELEPHONIC OR WRITTEN REQUESTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION WILL BE ACCEPTED OR RESPONDED TO IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Nuclear Energy is providing additional information relating to its March 17, 2006, Request for Expressions of Interest to perform Site Evaluation Studies in support of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) Technology Demonstration Program.  DOE is providing clarifying information regarding the scope of the GNEP Technology Demonstration Program and notification of the revised approach for awarding funding necessary to complete the site studies. DOE will make final decisions on the siting of GNEP Technology Demonstration Program projects after completion of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the GNEP Technology Demonstration Program. (Advance Notice of Intent, 71 FR 14505, March 22, 2006).  The EIS will evaluate the reasonable siting alternatives, including the location(s) of technology demonstration projects at DOE and potentially non-DOE sites. DOE desires to have a broad range of sites be considered for the technology demonstration projects, including non-DOE sites.  The eligibility for award to conduct Site Evaluation Studies will be limited to domestic non-DOE sites. The restriction to non-DOE sites applies regardless of the entity that would intend to propose to conduct a project on a DOE site. The decision to limit awards to non-DOE sites does not affect the ultimate eligibility of DOE sites for the siting of projects under GNEP Technology Demonstration Program.  DOE decided to restrict eligibility to non-DOE sites because DOE sites are generally well-characterized, and additional information required to support the development of the EIS can be obtained by tasking DOE contractors directly through their existing contracts. The anticipated requirements and deliverables for the site evaluation studies remain unchanged from the Request for Expressions of Interest. It is important for entities who are interested in being considered for hosting a technology demonstration project to be aware that the technology demonstration project(s) will require the storage of nuclear materials to support the demonstration facility activities. In particular, the demonstration of a spent nuclear fuel recycling facility will require the hosting site to accept and store spent nuclear fuel as feed into the separations process.

<CONTACT>Alice Oberhausen, Contracting Officer, Phone 850-452-4616 x31106, Fax 850-452-9398, Email alice.oberhausen@navy.mil
<DESC>This procurement is for one solicitation, structured as a Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) for General Construction resulting in the award of three Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts for a base year and three Option years.  Each contract shall be awarded with a minimum guarantee of $50,000 applicable to the base year of the contract only .  The total not-to-exceed value for all four years (Base, plus three Options) of each of the three contracts is $11,250,000.00.  The total 4 year (base year and three option years) estimated construction costs for all three IDIQ contracts is not-to-exceed $45,000,000.

After award of the initial contracts, the three successful offerors will compete for task orders based on using one of these three processes:  Best Value to the Government using trade off processes, or Low Price, or  Low Price Technically Acceptable. The Government will provide full plans and specifications for each task order or detailed shop drawings and a statement of work. The estimated dollar range of task orders to be issued is $25,000 - $3,000,000. The work will consist of General Construction  projects falling under NAICS Code 236220.  The small business size standards is $31,000,000.
One of the three contracts will be awarded to an 8(a) firm, using competitive procedures among the 8(a) offerors, provided an acceptable proposal is submitted, price and technical factors considered. The remaining two contracts will be made to the firms considered to be the Best Value and will be competed UNRESTRICTED.  If sufficient qualified 8(a) firms apply and are considered Best Value, it is possible that more than one contract will be awarded to 8(a) firms.  We will utilize two-step, Source Selection Procedures for this procurement. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and the use of a trade-off process when it may be in the best interest of the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror(s) or other than the highest technically rated offeror(s).  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to select approximately five  seven offerors based on factors that include:  Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Scheduling, and Small Business Subcontracting Effort.  Phase I factors relate to the base year and each of the three option year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including administrative, training, family housing, dormitory, and community support type facilities, not just the seed project identified in Section 00202 of the RFP.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit additional information on Factor B (Technical) pertinent to the seed project and price proposals for that project.  THE FULL SOLICITATION WILL BE POSTED ON 16 MAY 2006 AND WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD AT THE NAVFAC WEBSITE, URL ADDRESS:  WWW.ESOL.NAVFAC.NAVY.MIL

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES REQUIRED:  Contractor shall furnish all labor, material, equipment, supervision, transportation and management necessary to perform Maintenance Resource Management Training in accordance with the performance work statement.  Services under this contract are required to be performed at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.

Evaluation for award will be Performance-Price Trade-off (PPTO).  Issuance of the solicitation will be on or about 15 February 2006 and will close on or about 16 March 2006.  The solicitation will be available over the Internet only; NO HARD COPIES will be sent.  Follow the links on the EPS website to access the solicitation:  USAF Offices, Air Mobility Command Locations, and 436 CONS, Dover AFB, DE.     Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.  IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS:  Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires that any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contracts shall be submitted in electronic form.  Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system for implementing this statutory requirement.  Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided via the website.  Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.  As of January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and 
certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or to list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA.  Visit www.ccr.gov for more informprotect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is designed to help you gather information you need for the resultant clauses/provisions.  The information you provide in your questionnaire is automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  The questionnaire is not your official ORCA submission; the information reflected in your provisions is the version Contracting will review.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; you then acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.

<DESC>The Dayton VA Medical Center intends to negotiate a sole-source contract under the authority of FAR Part 19.14 for a base year with two one-year optional renewal periods. VISN 10, which encompasses the VA Medical Centers in Brecksville, Ohio; Chillicothe, Ohio; Cincinnati, Ohio; Cleveland, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Dayton, Ohio; and Fort Thomas, Kentucky; and VISN 11, which encompasses the VA Medical Centers in Ann Arbor, Michigan; Battle Creek, Michigan; Danville, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Indianapolis, Indiana; Marion, Indiana; and Saginaw, Michigan has a requirement for Repricing of Health Care Provider Invoices Services. The purpose of the contract is to assist the VA in meeting its economic objective to obtain high quality, accessible health care services at reasonable prices to serve the nation's veterans.  When eligible veterans receive their healthcare from providers in the private sector, the contract allows participating VAMCs to share in the savings available through discount agreements.  The contractor identifies savings for a variety of health care services including hospitalization, outpatient care, ambulatory surgery, behavioral health, ancillary and other services. The contractor's fee is a percentage of savings on a per-claim basis with no additional fee beyond the percentage of savings. The government has determined that Heritage Health Solutions is the only SDVOSB small business concern capable of satisfying this requirement. If other SDVOSB feel they can meet the needs of the government they should submit their qualifications, capabilities, etc., to the Contracting Officer no later than May 30, 2006. Information submitted will be evaluated with final determination resting with the Contracting Officer. All questions and comments shall be addressed in writing to the Administrative Contracting Officer either by FAX at (937) 268-6511, Extension 3094 or by email at Robert.Ivey@med.va.gov.

Work scope:     Approximately three (3) boreholes are to be drilled to target depths of approximately 1300 feet.     A borehole diameter of 7-7/8 inches at total depth is currently planned to accommodate borehole-testing activities.     These boreholes are to be utilized for conducting geophysical logging and seismic testing activities.     Following the testing activities, the boreholes will be decommissioned.     Rotary coring may be conducted through the basalt interbeds for one or all boreholes.

Mud rotary drilling method will be utilized for the test boreholes and coring.     Drilling contractor(s) must be able to provide portable mud tanks and solids control system and be able to run a closed mud system.     

Drilling activities for the test boreholes will be conducted on a 24 hour, 7 days per week work schedule.     Up to two drilling rigs may be deployed to expedite schedule for completing the test boreholes and associated testing activities.     It is anticipated that approximately 60 working days will be required to complete each borehole. 

The current proposed schedule is to initiate the test borehole drilling by August 10, 2006.

Sources Sought Notice

The USDA Forest Service (Forest Service) is seeking expressions of interest from qualified firms to provide social and environmental data collection and analysis services as part of an assessment of visitor use capacity on the upper reaches of the Chattooga River.  The upper Chattooga River is classified as Wild and Scenic and is bordered by the Ellicott Rock Wilderness as well as three National Foreststhe Francis Marion and Sumter in South Carolina, the Chattahoochee-Oconee in Georgia, and the Nantahala in North Carolina.

The Forest Service is conducting a visitor use capacity analysis of the upper Chattooga River using a combination of social and biophysical data collection approaches in order to reach a management decision regarding the potential addition of boating to recreation uses on this segment of the river.  Qualified parties are being identified to conduct all or part of these data collection and analysis services which may include:  literature review, expert panel reconnaissance evaluations of the river at different flow levels, existing use and condition observations, hydrology evaluations, focus groups, user surveys, trial public boating, and public involvement.  Parties that can exhibit a strong focus on safety in similar remote and rugged locations and skills in stakeholder collaboration and facilitation are desirable.  The proposed period of performance will depend on the type of services awarded, but the data collection period is generally expected to occur over 1 year (from summer 2006 to summer 2007).  

The Forest Service is seeking to identify interested and qualified parties with the specialized expertise and experience on similar projects to conduct any or all of the services identified above.  Prospective firms with offices in the regional vicinity of the Chattooga (Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, or Alabama) are preferred.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Interested parties are requested to review the above requirements and submit a statement of interest and qualifications which includes:  documentation of experience on similar projects, resumes of key staff, and office locations.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for initiating a long-term activity to develop a soil moisture remote sensing strategy specifically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and microsatellites.  A series of activities are planned to develop technical capacity and resources for soil moisture remote sensing from fixed wing UAVs and microsatellites with advanced L-band antenna technology.	As part of this process, NASAs EI51 Science Experiment Definition and Development Branch in conjunction with VP61 Earth Science Office is seeking through this Request For Information (RFI) ideas on technology leading to antenna designs that could be pursued to reduce the size and weight of L-band antennas for adaptation to our UAV/microsat remote sensing strategy.  The goal is to collect a variety of ideas and perspectives for the L-band antenna component of the remote sensing strategy.  Eventually a robust design will be developed using information from many sources including inputs provided through this solicitation. Guidelines  1. Ideas should be expressed in English concerning L-band antenna designs that address the majority of the following key elements of the remote sensing strategy:  	Antenna design must be scaled to the proper weight and size to be deployable from current UAVs with future follow-on work to embed the antenna into a microsatellite.  	Table 1 defines known design and operational requirements. 	More weighting is given to designs that achieve the Optimal requirements than the Minimum requirements. 	Generally accepted look angle for soil moisture retrieval from passive radiometry is from nadir to 45° and from active radar is from 40-45°.   	Resolution considerations assume a microsat altitude of 700KM and scale accordingly for the UAV that may operate at altitudes between 500-30,000 feet. 	To achieve the required Resolution a combination of hardware (i.e. beamwidth reduction) and software can be used. 	Solutions should be ranked by cost vs. benefit as to where future investments yield greater progress towards desired functionality, i.e. deployment to a microsatellite. 	Differentiate between physical and technological limitations and propose solutions to transcend technical barriers. Table 1.  UAV and Microsatellite Parameters. Parameter | Minimum Requirements | Moderate Requirements | Optimal Requirements Active or Passive | Passive | Active & Passive | Active & Passive Frequency/bandwidth | 1.413 GHz/±13 MHz | 1.413 GHz/±13 MHz | 1.413 GHz/±13 MHz Polarity | H | V, H | VV, VH, HV, HH Resolution | 100 KM | 40 KM | 5 KM 2. Each idea should be documented by providing the information requested in this document. The type of information requested includes summary information defining the objective, any dependencies it has on other objectives, architecture and operations assumptions associated with meeting the objective, and associated key decision points.  In cases where the submission identifies multiple ideas, advantages and disadvantages among the ideas should be expressed as well as distinctions in time frame to achieve results. Additionally, submissions may provide some indication of issues/constraints/enablers regarding technology, policy, legal, or programmatics.  3. Viable responses should be consistent with generally accepted laws of physics.  Innovative ideas including novel systems concepts are welcome, but should be consistent with advances that are reasonably achievable within a two year horizon.  4. All responses should be delivered electronically.  Each submission will receive an electronic notification of a successful upload. All submissions must be received by May 26, 2006.  5. Do not include in responses any information that is limited or restricted for use by the U.S. Government. By submitting information in response to this RFI, submitters of such information thereby consent to the release and dissemination of submitted information to any U.S. Government or non-U.S. Government entity to which NASA releases and disseminates the information for review. Review teams may be comprised of U.S. Government personnel from NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), other NASA Directorates, NASA Centers, and/or other U.S. Government agencies.  Moreover, review teams may include third parties, such as contractor personnel who support NASA.  As such, to the extent that any information submitted in response to this RFI is marked as or construed to be proprietary or business-sensitive, submitters are hereby notified (a) that such information may be disclosed to third parties and (b) that submission of information in response to this RFI constitutes consent to such handling and disclosure of submitted information.  This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only and the U.S. Government does not presently intend to award a contract at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is subject to FAR 52.215-3.  Any information obtained as a result of this RFI is intended to be used by the U.S. Government on a non-attribution basis for development of a strategy for remote sensing exploration.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.   The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted to Issac Jones no later than May 26, 2006.  Please reference RFI-VP61 in any response.  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information; it is NOT a Request for Proposal.  The intent of this RFI is to assist the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in conducting market research to identify potential sources of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) solid state data loader/recorders to replace the existing magnetic hard disks in the E-2C.  The replacement is intended to increase reliability of the loader/recorder, reduce aircraft operating costs, and provide growth capability for future performance enhancements.  NAVAIR is also interested in information regarding industry integration capabilities should they pursue integration of this COTS solid state device into existing E-2 aircraft.  A U.S. Navy integration team will lead the effort to install the replacement devices into the E-2 aircraft.

Pending future funding allocations, specific unit functional requirements will be defined.  For purposes of this initial market request for information, prospective vendors should consider the following general performance requirements:  The replacement shall be a solid state disk (SSD), electrically, mechanically and software compatible with a conventional (magnetic) hard disk.  The storage medium is not magnetic (like a hard disk) or optical (like a CD) but solid state semiconductor such as battery backed RAM, EPROM or other electrically erasable RAM like chip.  The SSD shall provide faster access time than a disk, because the data can be randomly accessed and does not rely on a read/write interface head synchronizing with a rotating disk. The SSD shall also provide greater physical resilience to physical vibration, shock and extreme temperature fluctuations.  The replacement shall have the capability to operate in a carrier-based aircraft environment with an expected 60-80% improvement in MTBF of the existing 800,000 hours.  The replacement shall have a formatted capacity of approximately 18GB.

The replacement shall ensure a positive return on investment when compared to total ownership cost of the current units.  Pending program funding, the U.S. Navy anticipates procurement of 100-150 SSDs for the E-2 aircraft over the next 2 years.

Responses to this RFI should include: 1.) A summary outline of the performance specifications of the proposed replacement SSD (including vendor part number); 2.) A rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate of unit costs; 3.)A ROM estimate of potential integration costs and, 4.)Any other information at vendor discretion, but limited to 5 pages.  

E-mail responses are requested to this announcement by 23 May 2006 and can be submitted to:

<DESC>SUBJECT: 
Request for Information (RFI) for a Privacy Program and Systems Review

DESCRIPTION: 
GSA is looking for companies with a proven track record of performing the following tasks:

(A) a review of the agency's technology, practices and procedures with regard to the collection, use, sharing, disclosure, transfer and storage of information in identifiable form;**
(B) a review of the agency's stated privacy and data protection procedures with regard to the collection, use, sharing, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal information in identifiable form relating to agency employees and the public;
(C) a detailed analysis of agency intranet, network and Websites for privacy vulnerabilities, including--
 (i) non-compliance with stated practices, procedures and policies; and
 (ii) risks for inadvertent release of information in an identifiable form from the website of the agency; and
(D) a review of agency compliance with the Act (Public Law 108-447, section 522).

**identifiable form is consistent with Public Law 107-347, the E-Government Act of 2002, and means any representation of information that permits the identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be reasonably inferred by either direct or indirect means.
Section 522, (d), of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, states that at least every 2 years, each agency will perform an independent review of the agencys privacy program, procedures, and systems to 

A)ensure the agency's description of the use of information in an identifiable form is accurate and accounts for the agency's current technology and its processing of information in an identifiable form; 

B)measure actual privacy and data protection practices against the agency's recorded privacy and data protection procedures; 

C)ensure compliance and consistency with both online and offline stated privacy and data protection policies; and 

D)provide agencies with ongoing awareness and recommendations regarding privacy and data protection procedures.

The Act tasks the Inspector General to utilize contractor support through a recognized leader in privacy consulting, privacy technology, data collection and data use management, and global privacy issues to perform this review.

If your business has performed privacy reviews that are similar the description listed above, please provide the following in your response:

<DESC>SUBJECT
Request for Information (RFI) for a Privacy Program and Systems Review

DESCRIPTION
GSA is looking for companies with a proven track record of performing the following tasks:

(A) a review of the agency's technology, practices and procedures with regard to the collection, use, sharing, disclosure, transfer and storage of information in identifiable form;**
(B) a review of the agency's stated privacy and data protection procedures with regard to the collection, use, sharing, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal information in identifiable form relating to agency employees and the public;
(C) a detailed analysis of agency intranet, network and Websites for privacy vulnerabilities, including--
 (i) non-compliance with stated practices, procedures and policies; and
 (ii) risks for inadvertent release of information in an identifiable form from the website of the agency; and
(D) a review of agency compliance with the Act (Public Law 108-447, section 522).

**identifiable form is consistent with Public Law 107-347, the E-Government Act of 2002, and means any representation of information that permits the identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be reasonably inferred by either direct or indirect means.

Section 522, (d), of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, states that at least every 2 years, each agency will perform an independent review of the agencys privacy program, procedures, and systems to 

A)	ensure the agency's description of the use of information in an identifiable form is accurate and accounts for the agency's current technology and its processing of information in an identifiable form; 
B)	measure actual privacy and data protection practices against the agency's recorded privacy and data protection procedures; 
C)	ensure compliance and consistency with both online and offline stated privacy and data protection policies; and 
D)	provide agencies with ongoing awareness and recommendations regarding privacy and data protection procedures.

The Act tasks the Inspector General to utilize contractor support through a recognized leader in privacy consulting, privacy technology, data collection and data use management, and global privacy issues to perform this review.

If your business has performed privacy reviews that are similar the description listed above, please provide the following in your response:
1.	Estimated price range for this work, 
2.	Ballpark estimate of the time it would take to perform this type of review, and 
3.	What type of information, other than a copy of the agency policy and procedures and system Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), you would need to perform this work.

The work will take place in the Washington, DC metro area and we estimate the following types and numbers of systems will need to be reviewed:

Personnel  2
Procurement  2
Product/Service Sales - 3
LAN - 1

Interested parties should comment within 15 calendar days from posted date.  The Government plans to issue the RFP and award a firm fixed priced contract by August of FY2006.  Only electronic responses will be accepted.

This solicitation is to be used for planning purposes.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PRICED PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.  The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, processes and sources with the capabilities and qualifications within pertinent industries involved in waste minimization.  STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES: The objective of this requirement is to identify qualified sources to divert used polypropylen e absorbents, socks, gloves, towels, etc. contaminated with petroleum-based organics and toxic metals to reuse from Fort Ruckers total solid waste stream by utilizing a process that assists Fort Rucker in reusing both the used materials and the organic an d metal contaminates.  Known processes are (1) solvent-based dry cleaning laundry using a closed-loop distillation dry cleaning process that removes organic contaminants from the used polypropylene absorbent and processes them for commercial resale, or reu se and (2) a gaseous ozone, closed-loop system utilizing cold water.  This solicitation seeks sources of these and other processes which result in zero hazardous waste from the system processes by reusing, selling or otherwise cessation of the waste chain and all processing byproducts.  The process must keep Fort Ruckers contaminated items in a closed loop handling process which is segregated, handled, and processed separately from wastes received from other facilities.  No part of the process may discharg e hazardous waste to a sanitary sewer or wastewater treatment system, or other disposal method.  Any process and/or contractor must meet the following legal requirements: (a) must be a legal entity registered, approved and licensed in the field of operatio n, (b) be licensed, approved or otherwise permitted to do business as required by the State of Alabama, Coffee County, Dale County, and the United States Government, (c) be capable of attaining formal recognition by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM),, Land Division, Hazardous Waste Section, and similar recognition from the State where the cleaning process takes place, (d) that the process meets the definition of reuse and (e) the contractor must have a history of satisfactory perfo rmance and have no unresolved infractions of any environmental rules, regulations or laws at the State, Local or Federal government level. Interested parties should submit an Expression Of Interested to the Contracting Agency Point of Contact, detailing the process(es) used, how the process(es) achieves the stated objective(s), and other information that may contribute to the Contracting Agen cys understanding of the scope and nature of the work and how the proposed process meets the end objective. The Contracting Agency may later issue a Performance Based Service Request For Proposals for work envisioned above.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Applied Biosystems, 850 Lincoln Center Drive, Foster City, CA 94404-1128 for purchase of a system for the purpose of multiplex detection of botulinum toxin genes A through G. The requirements for a system to accomplish this task are as follows: the instrument must be an integrated system designed to perform both real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and post-PCR (end-point) analysis. The instrument must be capable of analyzing 96 samples simultaneously in a 96-well plate format. The instrument must provide specialized application specific software that collects and analyzes the fluorescence data for the applications of absolute quantitation, relative quantitation, allelic discrimination/SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) detection and plus/minus assays that utilize internal positive controls. The relative quantitation software should incorporate the ability to simultaneously visualize and analyze up to ten 96-well plates of gene expression data. The instrument must support two homogeneous reaction chemistries, the fluorogenic 5' nuclease assay using TaqMan® probes and the SYBR® Green I double stranded DNA binding dye chemistry.  The instrument must utilize a tungsten-halogen lamp, a cooled charge coupled device (CCD) camera, and an optical system which utilizes multiple filters sets to enable multiple wavelength detection. Instrument software should utilize a multicomponenting algorithm to provide precise deconvolution of multiple dye signals, to enable the simultaneous detection of multiple fluorophores with reduced crosstalk. The five position filter wheel must have individual filters designed for use with a dedicated set of fluorescent dyes, which are available from the vendor as reporter dyes on fluorogenic probes. The instrument must be able to perform quantitative real-time PCR applications in less than 40 minutes in a 96-well format consumable with out the use of glass capillary tubes. The instrument must be capable of supporting three thermal cycling modes; Fast, standard and 9600 emulation. A heated lid assembly must heat the top half of the sample plates and their sealing devices so that no refluxing occurs in the sample plates. The heated lid assembly must apply sufficient sealing force to the reaction plate to ensure effective sealing and minimize reaction mixture evaporation. The instrument must have real-time quantitative PCR installation specifications which demonstrate the ability to distinguish between 5,000 and 10,000 template copies with a 99.7% confidence level. The instrument must be supplied with automated oligonucleotide design software. The instrument must have a footprint of less than 237 in2 (1,530 cms2) and must be supplied with an optional notebook computer to further reduce complete system footprint.

If the plan is viable, the parties intend to enter into agreements to implement and operate a pilot-production facility until such time that Phase III clinical trials with bismuth 213 are completed. INL scientists have identified two distinct proprietary methods for recovery of daughter isotopes from about 14 metric tons of source material at INL.     Both methods result in the recovery of actinium 225 from the source material, which includes mixed thorium isotopes containing about 40 grams of thorium 229.  NNM is capable of funding pilot-plant development of one or both methods, and providing actinium 225 to the medical community for use in clinical trials, therapeutic treatments or both.

<SUBJECT>U -- Epi-Ready Traininig
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a contract to the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA), 720 S Colorado Blvd., Ste. 970, South Tower, Denver, Colorado  80246-1925.  A contract shall be issued with a base year and four option years for acquisition of four Epi-Ready training classes, including annually updated materials, facilities, equipment, instructions and coordinate arrangements for students to attend the workshop in basic foodborne epidemiology for environmental health specialtist, sanitarians and other public health officials in the United States.  This training is specifically designed for our target audience and has received very high praise from the trainees; both state and federal experts who have audited the course.  NEHA is the only national association exclusively representing environmental health professionals in both the private and public sectors; as such, NEHA has a unique constituency of professional members actively engaged in performing the work and delivering the environmental health services at national and local levels; which consequently, provides unequalled access to the professionals CDC has targeted for this high-priority effort.  The contractor shall, as an independent organization, conduct three Epi-Ready Team Training courses and one Epi-Ready Train-the-Trainer Course (50 students per class).  Justification for other than full and open competition is considered due to the national concern about preparedness for intentional attacks on the food supply as well as reducing the level of morbidity and mortality from an unintentional outbreak of foodborne illness. NEHA is the only organization able to provide this service without program redundancy and an unneccessary reinvention of NEHA services. Failure to procure this training via NEHA will invariably cause a duplicative expenditure of considerable funds, and likely an inferior training being obtained by the CDC.   The solicitation with statement of work will be available within 10 days of this notice. Note 22 applies herein.  The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1):  FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for informational purposes.  This procurement is not set-aside for small business.

<SUBJECT>D -- Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration 2007 (CWID2007)
<DESC>1. This announcement is for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration 2007 (CWID 2007) scheduled for 29 May through 22 Jun 07. Combatant Command/Commander (COCOMs), Services and Department of Defense (DoD) Agencies (C/S/As), government agencies outside the DoD, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and national participants outside the United States (U.S.) must submit Interoperability Trial proposals for CWID by 30 Sep 06. Industry partners must work through a C/S/A or government agency sponsor from outside the DoD to submit Interoperability Trials. Complete details on CWID, to include, reference documents, the format and submission instructions for Interoperability Trials, are found at http://www.cwid.js.mil.
2. CWID is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's annual event enabling the COCOMs and international community to investigate command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) solutions that focus on relevant and timely objectives for enhancing coalition interoperability. U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM), on behalf of the Chairman, is responsible for the oversight of CWID. The intent of CWID is to investigate C4ISR technologies capable of being placed into an operational environment within 12-18 months following the execution period. Interoperability Trials include evaluations of hardware and/or software solutions. C/S/As are highly encouraged to conduct further investigation into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) using CWID as a vehicle. While the focus of CWID is on new and emerging technologies, CWID is also an appropriate venue for spiral development or validation of fielded/near-fielded commercial and/or DoD systems when appropriate to reduce fielding costs or transition timelines. The USJFCOM Capability Development Process will be the primary method used to identify candidate technologies that meet warfighter requirements.
3. United States European Command (USEUCOM) is the host COCOM for CWID 2006-2007. Consequently, the scenario for CWID will focus on exercising Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) responsibilities in conjunction with U.S. Northern Commands (USNORTHCOM) Home Land Security/Home Land Defense (HLS/HLD) initiatives, and increasing/enhancing involvement, integration, and interoperability with allies in USEUCOMs area of responsibility. Coalition participation remains the cornerstone of CWID and the anticipated international participants include: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and NATO constituent nations. In addition, COCOMs may invite nations, with prior Joint Staff approval, from within their respective area of responsibility to participate as multinational task force (MTF) members. USNORTHCOM intends to continue its CWID transformational efforts by investigating systems integration and interoperability solutions in the arena. This will include USNORTHCOMs Inter-Agency partners to include but not limited to Department of Homeland Security/Federal Emergency Management Agency (DHS/FEMA) and Public Safety Emergency Preparedness Canada.
4. CWID is conducted in a simulated operational environment to provide context for the validation of C4ISR solutions. Depending on the demonstrated capabilities during the execution phase and based on the criteria set forth in the CWID Additional Information document, each Interoperability Trial may receive one or more of the following assessments: Warfighter/Operator, Technical/Interoperability, and/or Security Capabilities assessment. The Systems Engineering and Integration Working Group (SEIWG), with input from other working groups, reports on Interoperability Trials not formally assessed by the Assessment Working Group (AWG). Results from Interoperability Trial assessments are documented in the CWID Final Report. Interoperability Trials with coalition partners are hosted over a worldwide secure network, enabling classified, releasable data to be exchanged between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, NATO, and Partnership for Peace nations. The CWID Joint Management Office (JMO) coordinates, engineers, and supervises the network backbone(s), information domains and the worldwide venue, and additionally provides the Interoperability Trial assessments.
5. To be considered for participation in CWID, each proposed Interoperability Trial must address one or more of the CWID objectives and sub-objectives listed in paragraph 7, and commit to provide all funding, personnel, training, hardware, software, documentation, etc, necessary to participate at one or more worldwide execution locations. In addition, Interoperability Trial proposals must be submitted in concert with a DoD or government sponsor, in the format outlined on the CWID web site.
6.  The CWID Senior Management Group (SMG), together with the coalition partners, will select Interoperability Trial proposals to satisfy CWIDs need to share and exchange critical, time-sensitive information between military organizations, international coalitions and civilian agencies. The selection criteria include how well the Interoperability Trials proposal satisfies one or more of the stated objectives and sub-objectives, and other considerations specified on the CWID web site in the additional information document.
The CWID hardware and software demonstrations support the overall Network Centric Warfare (NCW) construct and leverage the advantages of emerging technology. During the CWID execution phase, Interoperability Trial activities will be conducted over, or connected to, a world wide area network (WAN) that supports military and coalition operations while providing the infrastructure to facilitate the militarys role in providing Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA). CWID Interoperability Trials are executed within the context of an overarching scenario to demonstrate how coalition warfighting and civil interagency operations can benefit from emerging technologies.
The CWID 2007 Objectives described below contain several key differences from those associated with past Joint/Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstrations. First, the objective numbering reflects approximate linkage to traditional U.S. military staff codes and does not imply priority over/under another objective. For example, Objective 2 is aligned to encompass those functional areas normally associated with intelligence, which would reside in the staff equivalent of J2, N2, S2, G2, etc. Second, each objective is supported by sub-objectives that reference clearly defined U.S. COCOM and Coalition capability gaps and Service inputs. Thirdly, the objectives are linked, where possible, to the Joint Battle Management Command and Control Roadmap and Joint Mission Threads. Finally, the objectives are focused to reflect the following recurring themes:
a.	Investigating emerging and relevant technologies.
b.	Focus CWID on demonstrating solutions for COCOM theater capability gaps and challenges.
c.	Enhance multi-service, multi-national, and inter-agency cooperation and communication.
These process improvements facilitate post-CWID execution efforts to develop strategies aimed at responsibly bringing solutions to the warfighters.
Scope: All multi-national (to include DoD and non-DoD entities) information sharing solutions should be built on a foundation that is net-centric, secure, scalable, and bandwidth sensitive.
Objective 1
Cross-Domain Data Sharing. Provide the capability to share information across multiple networks of potentially different security classifications and caveats. Emphasis should be on passing information to U.S. controlled, coalition networks such as Combined Enterprise Regional Information Exchange Systems (CENTRIXS) network and coalition/alliance controlled networks such as Northern Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Initial Data Transfer System (NIDTS), NATO Mission Wide Area Network, or Releasable to Republic of Korea (RELROK). Data sharing encompasses the need for cross-domain solutions (CDS) and the assurance that information passed through CDS can be utilized by systems within all security enclaves. The criteria used to determine whether data can be shared should also focus on existing doctrine and/or policy-based information management and implement robust information assurance capabilities to protect data. GWOT requires CDS devices to permit collaboration with first responders, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), state and local governments as well as coalition information sharing.
a. Improve information sharing capability through the use of secure operating systems and applications to facilitate battle planning and information dissemination.
1.	Provide secure means for system-to-system communications across domains.
2.	Provide secure means to conduct a complete suite of collaboration activities across domains.
3.	Provide secure means for one-way and two-way file sharing across domains to include protection from malicious code and data leakage.
4.	Provide a secure intrusion detection solution for monitoring cross domain activities.
b. Improve CDS implementation at the tactical versus operational level, recognizing that the applications are different through echelons of command.
Explanation: Coalition operations require an information environment that spans multiple Communities of Interest (COI) where C/S/As are likely affected by limited bandwidth. Within any COI, mission success relates to the commanders command and control (C2) ability to communicate directly with individual users or first responders who may be detached from fixed information domains. Solutions to achieve improved C2 between diverse COIs should consider the use of existing approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations, or propose new approaches that are well on their way to gaining security certification for operational use. A major challenge to achieving a single integrated cross-domain solution is the development of a method, strategy, and universal standard for electronically marking or labeling classification and release caveats of documents and information streams. Since recent directives require DoD systems to use XML for data exchange, there is a need for XML-based technology that can provide a robust and secure method for marking classification and release caveats of documents and information streams.
Objective 2
Integrated Intelligence. Provide solutions that improve the commander's ability to share intelligence information products (documents, images, databases, etc.) with coalition partners, including joint and coalition forces, government agencies, NGOs and first responders.
a. Improve rapid situational awareness of the area of operations utilizing advanced visualization technologies.
1.	Demonstrate the ability to ingest geospatial data and display sophisticated 3D imagery that identifies all the elements of national resources, including political hotspots, military presence, economic icons, social, public works infrastructure, and other pertinent information.
2.	Demonstrate a robust visualization architecture that supports common open application program interfaces using approved international standards and DoD approved data formats and ports/protocols.
b. Enhance the maritime common operational picture (COP) through the intelligent retrieval and fusion of data from disparate sources, population of empty track fields, analysis and detection of anomalous track behaviors and uncovering operator errors.
c. Develop customized, adaptable, dynamic, scalable intelligence estimates.
d. Develop sensor capability that automatically stores and retrieves significant events to assist the conventional forces and first responders.
e. Demonstrate fusion analysis in which computer systems and software are used to extract and compare multiple sources of information and databases.
Explanation: Coalition information sharing must be secure, scaleable in scope and functional within the theater bandwidth available at all levels of warfare. Trial proposals should be capable of using existing interface standards and protocols that define the format, content, and exchange mechanisms for shared data. Solutions must support each nations disclosure and release policies as well as provide a secure means of consistently communicating accurate information in a multi-lingual military and/or local authority context. A key subset to creating and sustaining a coalition information-sharing environment is that users must be able to consistently and securely access, extract and utilize common information derived from dissimilar databases across multiple domains. Tools to translate documents, displays, and written/audio-exchanges between planners and end-users, is a necessity for successful operations at the military, agency, and other government organization levels.
Objective 3
Integrated Operations. Enhance the commanders capability to command, control and coordinate across joint and coalition forces, government agencies, NGOs, and first responders. Emphasis on:
a.	Demonstrate new technology or enhancement to existing technology that streamlines the operational decision-making process throughout the spectrum of military and civil operations, including GWOT contingencies and crisis response.
b.	Improved blue force tracking identification capability across multiple enclaves.
c.	Situational awareness using advanced visualization technologies (see Objective 2).
d.	Cross and secure spectrum interface capabilities for tactical/commercial radios.
e.	Common collaboration tool suite that is accepted by joint/conventional forces and HLS/HLD entities.
f.	Improved red force tracking capability across mission areas and user communities.
g.	Improved non-material solutions, specifically tactics, techniques, and procedures to task, discover, fuse and use Global Information Grid (GIG)-enabled products and services.
h.	Shifting the focus at the operational level to long-term integration of tactical operations with specific nation-building forces and capabilities.
i.	Increasing tactical autonomy and decentralization.
j.	Providing and sharing cultural and social awareness to a level approaching situational awareness.
k.	Improving mobility, survivability and adaptive dominance.
l.	Achieving a joint/coalition integrated fire control system of systems.
m.	Defending effectively against the use of Electro Magnetic Pulse (EMP) or Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).
Explanation: Integrated Operations imply that coalition, military and civilian authorities can harness the power of their respective information environments to collaboratively execute operations even in a bandwidth-constrained environment. The information exchange between these COIs must be accomplished in such a way that it inspires confidence at each activity that the information is being disseminated securely, and will only be available to the agreed upon and authorized participants. Solutions to achieve this data dissemination, across and within COIs, should consider the use of existing, approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations, or propose new approaches that are well on their way to gaining security certification for operational use.
Objective 4
Integrated Logistics. Demonstrate the ability to access and consolidate logistical information across organizational boundaries to provide the ability to assess and display, in near real time, information on the movement, location and status of joint forces, military services, interagency, coalition, NGO and first responder equipment, supplies and personnel en route, and/or deployed.
a.	Improve logistics data access, fusion and integration among COIs.
b.	Improve distributed operations, operational agility, distributed support and sustainment and exploitation of the vertical dimension of sustainment thereby reducing logistical infrastructure in-theater.
Explanation: Within the information environment, the commander must have responsive and effective logistics. Logistic data is contained within diverse logistics information systems maintained by the military and civilian agencies across the coalition. Access to that data implies combining total asset visibility and information during the transit of friendly forces into a single information presentation available across multiple information COIs. Solutions should address the locating and fusion of logistics information feeds as part of the commanders general situation awareness. Solutions to achieve CWID objectives should consider using existing approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations or propose new approaches that are relatively mature in gaining security certification for operational use.
Objective 5
Integrated Planning. Provide solutions that improve the COCOMs ability to conduct collaborative planning with coalition partners, including joint and coalition forces, government agencies, NGOs and first responders. Focus on enhanced collaboration and engendering a need to share vice a need to know culture.
a.	Improve sharing capabilities that support Essential Elements of Information (EEIs) for forces supporting CTF and HLS/HLD scenarios.
b.	Evaluate technologies and processes that support collection and dissemination of Command and Control (C2) information using Net Centric Enterprise Services (NCES).
Explanation: Integrated Planning implies that coalition, military, and civilian authorities can harness the power of their respective information environments to collaboratively plan operations even in a bandwidth-constrained environment. Collaborative planning and dissemination of products in a bandwidth constrained environment horizontally across and vertically within COIs is an emerging issue for the warfighter, particularly as software and procedure tools become sufficiently robust to be extended from the operational to the tactical level of warfare. The lack of robust planning and collaboration tools makes it difficult to provide the commander timely and complete information on which to develop decisions. Additionally, as Hurricane Katrina aptly demonstrated, planning between military, agency, and civilian authorities must be included in this technology development. 
Objective 6
Integrated Communications. Allied and coalition partners and other bandwidth disadvantaged users often find themselves on the frontlines, increasing risks without a robust, joint and combined, interoperable and multi-lingual information sharing capability. Coalition information sharing capabilities are necessary to improve information and knowledge sharing.
a.	Translation Services. Provide solutions that improve the COCOMs ability to share information with and receive information from multi-lingual coalition partners, potentially including improvements to language translation tools providing grammatically correct, military-context sensitive, multi-language translations which support verbal and textual collaboration within and between disparate information domains.
b.	Identify and evaluate an allied/coalition directory services architecture that facilitates the sharing of information among coalition nations.
c.	Create an interoperable interface between Service tactical radios and Coalition tactical radios.
1.	Improve interoperability between United States Marine Crop (USMC) tactical Ultra High Frequency/ Very High Frequency (UHF/VHF) radios in the frequency hopping mode and the USMC High Frequency (HF) radio with a Coalition suite of radios in the secure mode.
2.	The suite of radios need to be the communication medium between the US Army Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS), the USMC AFATDS, the U.S. Navys Naval Fire Control System, and Coalitions like system. Data must be passed in a secure mode using a NATO releasable key list and using the tactical radios small bandwidth.
3.	Identify and assess Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) solutions suitable for use over maritime tactical networks.
4.	Identify National Security Agencys high assurance internet protocol encryption devices to support CDS and coalition information sharing.
5.	Demonstrate domain controlled data protection at rest in a multi-domain coalition environment.
6.	Demonstrate Network Defense Situational Awareness and advanced anomaly detection technologies in a multi-domain coalition environment.
Explanation: Communications in a CWID context is interpreted as coalition information sharing, and is more than providing a radio communication or common operational picture at or between the strategic, operational, or tactical level of command. It must be secure, scaleable in scope and functional within the theater bandwidth available at all levels of warfare. Trial proposals should be capable of using existing interface standards and protocols that define the format, content, and exchange mechanisms for shared data. Solutions must support each nations disclosure and release policies as well as provide a secure means of consistently communicating accurate information in a multi-lingual military and/or local authority context. A key subset to creating and sustaining a coalition information-sharing environment is that users must be able to consistently and securely access, extract and utilize common information derived from dissimilar databases across multiple domains. Further, coalition operations are routinely conducted with multiple nations and organizations that are challenged with using a common language. A tool to translate documents, displays, and written/audio-exchanges between planners and end-users, is a requirement of operations at the military, agency, and other government organization levels. 
7. Subject to changes, the following milestones are to be used for planning purposes:
a. Interoperability Trial proposals due: 30 Sep 06.
b. Initial Planning Conference: 13 - 17 Nov 06, Tidewater area, VA.
c. Interoperability Trial selection due: 12-15 Dec 06.
d. Mid Planning Conference: 29 Jan - 2 Feb 07, Tidewater Area, VA.
e. Final Planning Conference: 26 Mar - 30 Mar 07, Tidewater Area, VA. 
f. CWID 2007 Execution: 29 May -22 Jun 07. 
1.	Preliminary set-up: 29 May - 1 Jun 07.
2.	Training and Rehearsal: 4 - 8 Jun 07.
3.	Interoperability Trials assessment and visitors: 11 - 21 Jun 07.
4.	Hot Wash: 22 Jun 07.
8. Administrative requirements: 
a. Information submitted by Interoperability Trials is considered and handled as non-proprietary.
b. Unclassified and classified networks will be used. Trial participants require a minimum of DoD SECRET clearance to participate in CWID 2007. However, participants desiring to focus only on the HLS/HLD mission set will not require a clearance.
c. Military or government civilian personnel will operate the Interoperability Trials during the execution phase. Interoperability Trials must provide required training and documentation at each CWID 2007 site where they intend to demonstrate their technology. CWID funds will not be provided for training. 
d. Interoperability Trials will be required to provide on-site technical and operational 
representation throughout all CWID 2007 planning conferences and 
execution phases. CWID funds will not be used to support this effort.
9. The CWID JMO point of contacts are MAJ Louis L. King (DSN 761) 703-681-2366 or e-mail: louis.king@disa.mil or Ms. Carla M. Jolly (DSN 761) 703-681-2342 or e-mail: carla.jolly.ctr@disa.mil. Refer to the CWID web site (http://www.cwid.js.mil.) for specific information about proposal submissions.
10. This announcement is not a request for proposal; no contract award shall be made as a result of this request for information. Industry participation in CWID 2007 is at no cost to the government.

<SUBJECT>A -- Follow-up of Patients Enrolled in the Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions (COMBINE) Study
<DESC>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) to conduct a second follow-up study of subjects who were previously enrolled in a multi-site randomized clinical trial (RCT) of combined medication and behavioral therapy for alcoholism.  

RTI is the one responsible source that can satisfy the Agencys requirement because (1) RTI is the sole owner of critical previously collected data on human subjects, (2)
has extensive experience necessary to conduct the study proposed  for the current contract; and  (3) no other source can supply the services and data that will satisfy agency requirements for the follow-on work for this study.

Development of the original study, called Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions (COMBINE), was initiated in 1998 and supported by NIAAA under a co-operative agreement.  Data collection was begun in 2001.  In COMBINE, 1383 subjects were randomized to medications: one, both or neither (placebo) naltrexone or acamprosate combined.  In addition to the medication subjects were assigned to either (a) a 16-week behavioral therapy or (b) no behavioral therapy.  Eleven recruitment/ treatment sites and one co-coordinating center participated in COMBINE.  Extensive information was collected on subjects, including data from numerous questionnaires over several time points, tissue samples and genetic analyses.  Staff from the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) participated in development of data collection instruments.
 
A 5-year grant for a follow-up study (Cost Effectiveness of Alcohol Treatment) was awarded to RTI in 2002.  Eight hundred thirty-five subjects and 9 of the 11 original study sites participated in this, the first COMBINE follow-up study.  Follow-up data but no treatments were administered under this study.  A series of in-person interviews were conducted at the 9 participating sites.  Data collection for this study will conclude in the fall of 2006.  Most participants at the 9 sites provided informed consent to (a) be interviewed and (b) have their data from the COMBINE study, with identifiers, linked to data collected under the first-follow-up study.  Under the grant mechanism, these data belong to the grantee, RTI.  In addition to these data, the study maintained records of subject location information and one or two personal contacts useful for tracing subjects who moved and/or changed phone numbers.  

For cost and efficiency purposes, NIAAA plans to conduct the second COMBINE follow-up study using a single contractor (RTI) and telephone interviews.  The contractor will help design and gain Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of the study.  Confidential contact information, already maintained through the RTI grant, will be used to track currently-enrolled subjects.  Subjects will be provided with details of the new follow-up study and asked to provide informed consent for the new study.  Four half-hour telephone interviews, planned at yearly intervals, will be administered to consenting subjects.  Development of the interviews will be done by personnel familiar with the COMBINE and first follow-up instruments.  As in the first follow-up study, subjects will be asked for their consent to link the data from COMBINE and the first follow-up studies with the second follow-up study.  These procedures require that the contractor have access to confidential identifiers and other data.  

Substantial data (including participants confidentially provided data and list of contacts) which is required to conduct the current study is owned by RTI.  Furthermore, participants confidential information may not be passed on to another research organization without prior consent of each participant.  As RTI has the unique resources to provide the particular research services proposed, a sole source contract to RTI is the only means to conduct the second follow-up phase as described.  

Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, the Research Triangle Institute is the only source capable of performing this requirement due their ownership of the data and prerequisite knowledge and experience because of their work under the Cooperative Agreement and performing as the grantee for the COMBINE study under the NIAAA Grant.   

To begin anew with a different source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition as well as unacceptable delays in obtaining the required data.   

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements as described above.  A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposal, nor is an RFP available.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>Description		W911KB-06-T-0032 Long-Term Wind, Wave and Storm Surge                   Climatology Project, Various Locations, Alaska CONTRACT INFORMATION:  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 the US Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District, will be intends to award a Purchase Order to Oceanweather, Inc. for assistance to perform the services described below.  The Purchase Order will be a  sole source under NAICS 541710.  Award of the Purchase Order is anticipated for June 16, 2006.     PROJECT INFORMATION:  Typical types of services to be provided may include:    Contractor must possess the skill, based on an expertise in the meso-scale meteorological modeling, skilled meteorologists, hardware, and software to digitize the pressure field s, incorporate other sources of measured surface data, and accurately interpolate over time and space necessary for a model implementation in the required time frame.  The accuracy and timely completion of the current project hinges on the timely arrival of these wind fields, and their quality.  The time constraint is severe. Oceanweather, Inc. has been found to be extremely rewarding in providing accurate wind fields in  a timely fashion.  The company is geared to face these impediments, and based on past work, has been the key ingredient in the success of these projects.  In addition, wind fields for the past two (DMT and Barrow) projects in the Alaska domain will be use d as the basis of this project, slightly extending the domains in space and generating wind/pressure fields for the months (November through June) not included in the original work.  Consistency in the methodology and technology is required for the generat ion of a long-term climatology.  Any change in the wind, pressure, ice-field, wave and storm surge generation will be extremely detrimental to the development of the climatology.  It is important that Oceanweather, Inc. be used for this work to assure the consistency of the data from the prior work (DMT and Barrow) with this new work, so the whole product is usable and accurate for the development of wind/wave climate across the entire west coast of Alaska.  A determination by the Government not to compete the requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14


NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/Screening Information Request (SIR) for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Office of Safety, Health and Environment (OSHE).  TSA hereby makes aware all interested parties that it is soliciting technical proposals under a SIR to fulfill its Voluntarily Abandoned Property (VAP) requirement.  This is a full and open SIR and all interested companies are invited to participate regardless of business size.  Any and all updates to this synopsis/SIR will be posted to the Government Point of Entry at www.fbo.gov.  Interested parties are encouraged to check www.fbo.gov frequently for possible updates.  While any and all questions must be directed to one of the Government points of contact identified in this synopsis/SIR, answers to those questions, as well as any and all clarifications, extensions or changes will be posted to www.fbo.gov and will only be available at www.fbo.gov prior to the closing date and time of the SIR.

This procurement will be conducted using the Transportation Security Administration Acquisition Management System (TSAAMS).  Interested parties may learn more about the Acquisition Management System at http://fast.faa.gov.  TSA is exempted from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA  Public Law 107-71) and empowered to use TSAAMS by the same authority.  TSA will conduct this solicitation using the following steps:  

Interested firms may contact TSA for a copy of its Screening Information Request (SIR), including evaluation factors, instructions, list of TSA Federalized Locations, Non-Disclosure Agreement and Statement of Work.  Firms may then submit a technical proposal in response to this SIR.  TSA will evaluate these technical proposals strictly in accordance with those evaluation factors as published in the SIR instructions.  Based on this evaluation, TSA will establish a competitive range consisting of those firms who, based on their technical proposal, are most likely to receive award.  Those firms who are not included in the competitive range will be notified and will have 3 business days to request a debriefing with the Contracting Officer (CO).  Those firms who are included in the competitive range will receive a request for offer that includes an invitation to submit a price proposal for their technical approach as well as be invited to participate in oral presentations.  The subject of these presentations is clearly stated in the SIR.  TSA will then conduct a best value analysis by comparing the proposed price to the proposed technical approach for each firm included within the competitive range.  TSA envisions a single award as the end result of this screening process to a company whose proposed technical solution and price (inclusive of the base and all 4 option years) represents the best value to the agency.  However, TSA makes no guarantee of award of contract as a result of this or any future SIR.        

Background

Prior to passage of ATSA, the air carriers were responsible for the screening of commercial air carrier passengers.  They also were responsible for the collection and disposition of all prohibited items, including hazardous materials.  With the passage of ATSA, TSA became responsible for the screening of these passengers.  49 U.S.C. §44901(a).  

As a result, TSA determined that it had the legal responsibility to accept prohibited and hazardous items voluntarily abandoned by passengers at security checkpoints.  Having accepted the property, TSA is legally liable for the disposition of abandoned or forfeited personal property.  Hazardous materials, if not otherwise donated per 41 CFR 101-42.304, must be disposed of in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations.  42 U.S.C. §6901 et seq.

In 2003, TSA issued the National Voluntarily Abandoned Property and Hazardous Material Disposal Contract to assist with the management, disposition and disposal of the prohibited and hazardous items voluntarily abandoned by passengers at security checkpoints.  In April 2005, TSA added lighters to the prohibited item list as directed by Congress in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004.  Since adding lighters to the prohibited items list, the amount of hazardous material abandoned at TSA screening checkpoint has nearly quadrupled.  

TSA did not anticipate the volume of lighters being abandoned at the checkpoint to remain at such a high level.  

TSA hereby makes all interested parties aware that the incumbent Contractor for this effort is Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).  While a contract for VAP was awarded previously, the requirement has changed substantially from its original inception and this procurement far exceeds the scope of the original requirement.  

Industry Day

TSA will conduct an Industry Day at TSA Headquarters in Arlington, VA on May 23, 2006 at 2:00pm.  TSA Headquarters is located at 601 South 12th St in Arlington VA, directly across from the Fashion Center at Pentagon City.  All interested parties are invited to attend.  Please note that attendance at Industry Day is not mandatory for responding to the SIR but it is highly encouraged.  If you plan to attend, you must alert the TSA point of contact listed herein as soon as possible.  Interested parties must attend Industry Day in person and each firm is limited to two (2) attendees.  No phone number will be provided for call-in participation.  Interested parties are advised of the following security procedures at TSA:

Please arrive at least 20 minutes prior to the start of the event to 601 South 12th St.  Street parking is extremely limited and garage parking runs anywhere from $2-$4 per hour so Metro is highly encouraged.  Proceed to the Visitors Center at 601 South 12 St to check in.  TSA Security will log in all visitors and issue temporary badges.  This process can cause delays so interested parties are encouraged to arrive early.  Visitors will be escorted to the meeting room by a member of TSAs staff.  Visitors are cautioned that they must be escorted at all times by a member of TSAs staff while in TSA spaces.  Failure to abide by TSAs visitor procedures may result in expulsion from TSA spaces.  

Tentative Milestones:

TSAs tentative milestones (which the Agency reserves the right to change) for this procurement are as follows:

May 19, 2006  SIR Available to interested parties
May 23, 2006  Industry Day held at TSA HQ

The SIR contains the SOW, which delineates those requirements that must be met in support of TSAs VAP program.

However, TSA is willing to consider the merit of any proposed subcontracting or teaming agreements as stated in the Evaluation Factors contained in the SIR.  TSAs primary point of contact is Mark Urciuolo, who can be reached via phone at 571-227-4213 or via e-mail at mark.urciuolo@associates.dhs.gov.  If Mark Urciuolo is not available, please contact the Contracting Officer (CO), Mr. Marvin Grubbs, at 571-227-1581 or at marvin.grubbs@dhs.gov.

This is a commercial item procurement of SATCOM Radio Freque ncy (RF) Power Amplifiers used for ongoing contingency operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The objective of the program is to equip designated aircraft with more robust airborne communications systems due to the dispersed nature of operation s.  Market research has identified Tallahassee Communication, Inc., as the only responsible source for this SATCOM hardware which was previously tested with Government CONOPS and is compatible with the required airborne platforms, using existing mounting h ardware requiring no further modification.

Amendment Number 1 to United States Agency for International Development solicitation (RFP) TRN-06-043 for Food Aid Warehouse and Cargo Handling Services in / near the Persian Gulf Region and/or the Greater Horn of Africa Region and/or the Southern Africa Region.

PURPOSE
The purpose of this solicitation amendment is to 1) Expand the area of consideration to include the greater Horn of Africa region and the Southern Africa region; 2) Clarify the governments interest in learning about an offerors bulk grain commodity storage capability, if available; 3) Provide answers to questions posed by parties interested in this proposal; and 4) Extend the date for receipt of proposals to June 15, 2006.

AMENDMENTS to USAID solicitation TRN-06-043:

1.	Delete any and all solicitation references to the area of consideration stated as (or similar to) the Persian Gulf Area and the Horn of Africa and in lieu thereof substituted the Persian Gulf and/or the Greater Horn of Africa and/or the Southern Africa Regions.
 
2.	A solicitation paragraph reads, If the cargo is discharged at port in bulk: 1) the contractor will receive cargo....will be for the account of the contractor; or 2) (if available) receive and store bulk commodities, to be bagged or re-delivered as directed at a later time.  Add the following language  While bulk grain storage is not a solicitation requirement, the ability to receive and store bulk commodities should be noted in your technical proposal.  The government will not evaluate proposals on the basis of whether or not bulk grain commodity storage is available.

3.	Delete the date for receipt of proposals stated as, Monday June 5, 2006 and in lieu thereof substitute the date Thursday June 15, 2006.

4.	The following questions and answers are hereby provided:
The below answers are provided by the government in response to specific questions posed by various potential offerors.

QUESTION 1) What warehouse and cargo handling capacities are required in the Persian Gulf and Horn of Africa.

ANSWER: The government is seeking warehouse space and cargo handling capability, for food aid commodities, covering between a minimum of 10,000 metric tons and a maximum of 30,000 metric tons on the warehouse floor at any point in time. Generally, packaged food aid commodities (25 kg bags, 50 kg bags, boxed cartons of vegetable oil in cans) are delivered to the local port or the warehouse door via ocean containers.  Containerized shipments arrive in lots of about 500 to 1000 metric tons per week  about 25 to 50 containers per week.  Container vessels drop the containers at the local port container yard, and the warehouse calls forward containers for unstuffing and placing commodities on the warehouse floor.  Re-delivery of commodities will require similar cargo handling capability as required during initial delivery.  One of the significant RFP proposal evaluation criteria is the potential contractors ability to handle receipt and re-delivery orders or operations at the same time.  Offerors are asked to provide an indication of the labor and equipment reserve capacity available at the warehouse to handle in-coming and out-going shipments at the same time.

QUESTION 2) Is the base proposal for 10,000 mt or 30,000 mt? Resources and warehousing will be completely different for each.

ANSWER: The solicitation states a requirement range, and your proposal should offer warehouse and cargo handling services, covering a minimum of 10,000 metric tons and up to a maximum of 30,000 metric tons.  Humanitarian food aid requirements fluctuate over time. The government cannot accurately predict the exact tonnage of food aid commodities that may be required during the term of this warehouse contract.  History supports the requirement that we pre-positioned stocks between 10,000 and 30,000 metric tons.  The government seeks a contractor that is able to offer a range of space and handling capability.

QUESTION 3) How many SKU's will be stored. Do we have the cube for each?

ANSWER: The solicitation states that packaged whole grains and/or processed corn, wheat and/or soybean products and refined vegetable oils may be stored at the warehouse.  Agricultural products may be bagged in 25 kg. or 50 kg. multiwall polypropylene or paper bags.  Vegetable oils will be in 5-gallon pails or similar containers.  In estimating how much usable space is needed per commodity, the following rules of thumb may help. (These are estimated figures) 
One MT of a bagged commodity (in 25 kg bags) requires approximately 2 cubic meters of usable storage space. One MT of edible vegetable oil in tins requires approximately 1.4 cubic meters of usable storage space. In using the stacking suggestions noted in the RFP referenced documents, do not stack fiberboard cases of oil tins higher than 8 layers. Do not stack flour and meals higher than 20 layers. Do not stack grits or whole grains higher than 30-40 layers.
In addition to packaged commodities, bulk food aid commodity storage and handling may also be proposed as part of your submission, and would be of interest during the technical evaluation if your proposal, although it is not a requirement.

QUESTION 4) Will the flow of inbound/outbound be staggered during initial receipt and monthly replenishment -- e.g. will the 10,000 mt come at once and will each 3,000 mt come in/out at once each month. Again, this has major impact on resource requirements.

ANSWER: Commodities are generally delivered (received by the warehouse) and re-delivered in a staggered fashion, with between 500 to 1,000 metric tons arriving or departing during a week.  This does not apply to bulk commodity shipments.  Higher quantities may require additional cargo handling resources.  The government is not bound by the above estimate, and may require delivery and re-delivery handling at higher levels.  Actual contract performance may require receipt and re-delivery of commodities at the same time.  The solicitation asks offerors to indicate their ability to handle receipt and re-delivery of cargo and their throughput and handling capability to un-stuff and stuff containers.  The government is interested in an offerors capability of handling receipt and re-delivery at the same time.  Your proposal should address this issue by indicating your ability to obtain and apply additional resources to cover the possible simultaneous receipt and re-delivery of commodities. 
 
QUESTION 5) Will the flow of inbound/outbound be staggered during initial receipt and monthly replenishment -- e.g. will the 10,000 mt come at once, and will each 3,000 mt come in/out at one time each month.

ANSWER: See the response to question 4 above.  Note: The solicitation includes an evaluation scenario and a request that your proposal provide the government with an estimated cost for the proposed scenario.  In responding to the evaluation scenario you may estimate your cost of performance on the basis of all cargoes arriving or departing at one time at the beginning or end of the month.  The proposal cost evaluation scenario is not indicative of the planned actual receipt or re-delivery contract performance which may be required by the government.

QUESTION 6) What are the delivery region(s) for the food aid?  Will all deliveries be to countries within the Horn of Africa?  If not, provide the name of the other countries, and the split in cargo volumes between the regions. 

ANSWER:  The potential delivery regions for the food aid will be any area or region of the world.  The most likely areas to be covered by this solicitation, and any resulting warehouse and cargo handling service contract, will be the regions of East and South Africa  and the Southern Asia Region.  We do not know the split in cargo volumes to be delivered between these potential regions.

QUESTION 7) Will the contractor be required to deliver to the port of discharge and/or consignee, or only to the port of embarkation?
 
ANSWER: For re-delivery of commodities, the warehouse contractor will generally stuff ocean containers or load trucks at their warehouse door.  In addition, the warehouse contractor may be required to deliver break bulk commodities to a f.a.s. vessel position at the discharge port.

QUESTION 8) Will refrigerated cargo be shipped?  If so, provide the estimated number of containers and metric tons and provide the percentage split between freeze and chill cargo.

ANSWER: The government does not anticipate a requirement for refrigerated cargo.

QUESTION 9) Will the government reimburse the contractor for the cost of fumigation, or must it be built into the rates? 

ANSWER: The government will reimburse the contractor for fumigation at cost.

QUESTION 10) Will past performance / audit or any performance data on past contracts similar to this be made available to the public?

ANSWER: The government does not plan to release information about past performance, audit or performance data for similar contracts.  The government considers the services solicited by this RFP to be commercial services.

Except as hereby amended, all other terms and conditions of solicitation TRN-06-043 remain unchanged.

<DESC>This amendment answers questions submitted to NIST.  Two (2) questions were submitted.  The questions are posted with associated answers after each question.

Question 1) What is the working distance (autocollimator-to-target)? Is this distance fixed or variable (if variable, how much); 
Answer:  Because the autocollimator will be used in at least two different experiment settings, NIST expects the working will be different from 2cm(~1 inch) to 30cm(~12 inches).  The autocollimator shall have the angular resolution 0.05 arc second or better at working distance of 15cm(~6 inches)

Question 2) What is the size and finish of the target mirror? If none is specified, can a target mirror of 50mm diameter (minimum) and 1/10th wave flatness be used?
Answer:  NIST would like to use a mirror of size in 2.5cm (or less) diameter.  Sometimes the metal square gauge block may be used as the target (roughness [Rq] 2 to 4nm) to reflect the light.
