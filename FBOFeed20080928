<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING REVISED POSTING AND REVISED PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS).  ALL OFFERORS MUST ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF THIS AMENDMENT.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Solicitation No. FA3002-08-IT-0002
The solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP) 

This acquisition is full and open
NAICS: 541511
Small Business size standard: $23.0M
Period: Basic year (10 Oct 08 - 09 Oct 09) and 4 one year options

The objective of this initiative is to provide AETC/A8 with information technology services supporting the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) Planning and Programming System (APPS).  The scope of this effort is to implement government directed functionality and provide maintenance of the system.  The purpose of this requirement of work is to obtain contractor provided professional IT services supporting the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) Planning and Programming System (APPS) Data management.  Data management is a significant issue facing AETC in its management of a well-integrated planning, programming, and execution system.  The purpose of this system is to provide AETC’s planners and programmers with a decision support tool.  This tool is capable of analyzing current, required, and historical funding levels to assess programmatic disconnects and deficiencies prior to AETC’s annual Program Objective Memorandum (POM) submission, Command Financial Plan (Fin Plan) and Financial Initial Distribution.  The support for this command-wide planning, programming, and financial execution decision aid is of critical importance to the development of future POM submissions, annual development of the AETC Master Planning Document and development of the annual Command Financial Plan and Financial Initial Distribution.  The significant amount of data involved in these efforts, particularly in the maintenance and upkeep of the Master Planning Document, prohibits manual execution of these activities.  Consequently, this tool captures planning priorities, programmatic needs and financial plans across all mission areas.  In addition, it is the primary data source and repository for all command planners, programmers, and financial managers.  Properly supported, this decision support tool significantly enhances financial control of all AETC programs.  Additionally, this system provides the command’s program managers, program element monitors, financial analysts, logisticians, commanders, directors, and senior leaders with an unprecedented level of insight into AETC’s planning, programmatic and financial execution needs.

<SUBJECT>15 -- Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Requirements
<SOLNBR>HSBP1008R1590
<RESPDATE>030608
<ARCHDATE>03062008
<CONTACT>Stephanie F Alexander, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-344-2327, Fax 202-344-3322, Email stephanie.alexander@dhs.gov - Susan A Baptist, Contracting Officer, Phone 202/344-1223, Fax 202/344-1254, Email susan.baptist@dhs.gov
<DESC>This acquisition will be in support of Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Office of CBP Air and Marine.  CBP intends to procure Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Predator B aircraft, aircraft equipment, engineering and logistics, and operational and maintenance support services on a sole source basis to General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI), 16761 Via Del Campo Court, San Diego, CA  92127.  This requirement further consist of procuring air vehicle operators and mission payload operators, systems airframe and equipment repairs/modification, system upgrades or engineering changes, software support services, air vehicle and mission equipment systems integration, training, material and equipment support issues resolution and technical support services, maintaining support of ground station facilities, material and equipment procurement services, and data development and documentation.
General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI) provides unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) aircraft, equipment and services to CBP under HSBP1005D00994.  GA-ASI is the only manufacturer of the MQ-9 Predator B, the UAS currently deployed by CBP.  Because the MQ-9 Predator B is proprietary to GA-ASI, no other company can produce this particular aircraft nor can any other company support, operate, and maintain the CBP program at the anticipated levels that are forecasted for the future.  The Predator B cannot be procured from any other source, and the attempt to transition the support services for the Predator B to a company other than GA-ASI would be impractical.  No other company has the capacity like GA-ASI nor the knowledge to support the UAS program that CBP has developed.  GA-ASI knowledge of the operation and maintenance of the Predator B is unique as well as their knowledge of CBP UAS program.  The acquisition of any other system and services irreparably impact the CBP UAS program, cause a decrease in security at the Nations borders and cause costly delays in the CBP UAS deployment schedule.  Based on these reasons, and combined with unchanged CBP UAS operational requirements as well as CBP A&Ms own ongoing research of the UAS market, GA-ASI is the one responsible source for the UAS aircraft equipment and support services required by CBP and no other supplies or services will satisfy these requirements.

In August 2005, CBP awarded GA-ASI a contract for four (4) Predator B UASs.  The award was based on a competitive procurement process during which the GA-ASI Predator B, with its long duration, high altitude, and persistent surveillance capability, as well as expanded payload capabilities and an agile transportability feature, emerged as the one system that met all of CBPs operational requirements.  Due to the lack of a government infrastructure to support a UAS system, GA-ASI installed, integrated, operated, and continues to operate and maintain the Predator B for CBP.

The Predator B provides the following Level I requirements:
- Remotely piloted vehicle that meets FAA control restrictions
- Capable of long range surveillance and intelligence gathering, endurance
       o Flexible C3ISR
       o 2200 lb payload capacity
       o 30 hour flight time
       o Pilot in the loop
- Capable of providing direct support for ground interdiction
- Meets stringent FAA requirements for a COA; acceptable level of safety
       o FAA review of requirements for a COA; acceptable level of safety
       o Only UAS to receive FAA approval of Air Worthiness Statement (November 2006)
       o Extensive Ground and Flight Testing
- Only UAS proven in the NAS 
- Payload capacity makes it capable of supporting growth in sensor technology
- U.S. military applications of the Predator B enable CBP to leverage inter-agency technology, training, logistics and maintenance support
- GA-ASI integrated, and currently operates and maintains the Predator B for CBP

GA-ASI UAS aircraft and equipment have had to meet CBP UAS performance measures (e.g., system availability rates) and its support services have had to meet service contract requirements. GA-ASI continues to meet or exceed CBP requirements in performance and reliability.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grants CBP A&M a Certificate of Authorization (COA) for Predator B operations to fly in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS), in part because of its safety record operating within the NAS.  In fact, the Predator B has more hours within the NAS than any other airframe.

GA-ASI successfully and satisfactorily supports CBP UAS operations.  A service provider other than GA-ASI would lack commonality with the currently deployed CBP UAS and cause a lengthy operation downtime during testing, selection, and transition phases, as well as a reinvestment for integration and training.  The unavoidable grounding of Predator B operations during transition would mean a significant interruption in support to CBP agents in the southwest border region, a decrease in CBPs ability to support its in homeland security, and a costly in CBPs northern border expansion efforts,

Since taking delivery of CBP 104 in September 2006, the GA-ASI Predator B has been a force multiplier for CBP.  During 2006 and 2007, Predator Bs flew approximately 2,000 hours in support of CBP southwest border security missions.  This flexible and responsive system will also allow CBP to coordinate with organizations that share similar missions, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of Defense (DoD).  CBP A&M works with the DoD to gain efficiencies in acquisition, testing, training and deployment of the Predator B.

GA-ASI Predator Bs provide unique and specialized intelligence gathering, surveillance and tactical support to CBP agents on the ground in the southwest border region and will add much needed support to northern border operations.  CBP UAS operations must continue uninterrupted; this is only possible with the UAS aircraft equipment and ongoing support services of GA-ASI.

GA-ASI is the sole capable prime contractor for the UAS Predator B Program.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact GA-ASI directly.  See Numbered Note 22.
