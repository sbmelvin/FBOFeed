<RESPDATE>050903
<ARCHDATE>03252004
<CONTACT>Elaine Felchle Purchasing Agent 70125042423306 EFelchle@gp.usbr.gov;
<DESC>Background:  The existing intake facility consists of a concrete intake structure with a screen within Lake Oahe and approximately 1400 feet of 10-inch ductile iron pipe terminating at wetwell with vertical turbine pumps for pumping water to the water treatment plant.  In past years, the elevation of Lake Oahe has been high enough for adequate water flow to the wetwell by gravity.  With the current and forecasted low Lake Oahe water levels, a submersible pump is required on the inlet end to force adequate water through the 10-inch pipe to the wetwell.  The water depth is approximately 25 feet at the existing screen and intake structure. Principal components of the work to be performed include the following:  (A) Remove the existing screen on the lake inlet end of the 10-inch inlet pipe; (B) Furnish and install a pipeline tee, gate valves, submersible pump-motor unit, and new intake screens on the inlet end of the 10-inch inlet pipe to enable water to be drawn either through the gravity flow screened inlet or through the submersible pump with screened inlet; and (C) Furnish and install electrical wiring from the wetwell to the submersible pump and furnish and install necessary electrical control equipment for proper operation of the new submersible pump.  Existing electrical wiring and facilities may be utilized to the extent that the wiring and other electrical facilities meet requirements of the National Electrical Code. Work must be coordinated with the Fort Yates water treatment plant operator such that the operator can insure  adequate water is available to water users while modifications are being completed.  Work must commence and be completed in a manner that will not unduly hamper the operation of the treatment plant. Competition is unrestricted (designated industry group NAICS Code 23491) under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (GovWorks), intends to make a firm-fixed-price, sole source award to Milliman USA.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the United States Department of Agriculture Risk Management Agency (RMA).  In a project that was completed in February 2003, Milliman USA did extensive statistical, economic, and financial analyses that led to its development of a computerized statistical Model for the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA). This new project is a follow-on to both the analyses and the SRA model, the objectives of which are to extend risk analyses and to extend and update the computer model to provide statistically sound simulations of reinsurance experience on an individual approved insurance provider and book of business basis. Familiarity and experience with the Model and the Federal Crop Insurance Program are considered essential to satisfy the Period of Performance, which is in two phases: up to and including May 30, 2003, and from June 2, 2003 to July 28, 2003. The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only.  This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.

<CONTACT>Cynthia Spencer, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109653369, Fax 4109659560, Email cynthia.spencer@ssa.gov
<DESC>In an effort to improve its World-Class service to its customers through automation, the Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to modify it's present contract with The National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information (NAPHSIS) to continue obtaining information needed for program purposes from States.  Currently, SSA offices request information by mail, telephone, fax, or request the client to obtain the data from the respective State agency. Because of this labor intensity, the ability to confirm electronically (i.e. online) names, dates, places and various other pieces of information, if available, of birth and death information in the United States and its Territories is preferred.  The confirmation will be used to assist the Agency in its processing of applications for benefits and for Social Security cards.  The requirement is for birth information from 1935 to present and death information for the current and prior year.  All online information of this type is needed for all 50 States. 
The National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information (NAPHSIS) represents the States and territories of the U.S. on issues and actions involving public health statistics, public health information systems and vital records registration.  The Association provides standards and principles for administering this information. SSA began to pilot EVVE in August 2002. The last of the 7 remaining sites did not begin pilot participation until February 2003. SSA needs to continue the pilots to gather additional data, enhance EVVE for potential national rollout and prepare a pilot evaluation for presentation at the NAPHSIS annual meeting. NAPHSIS is the only entity that can continue to assist in the monitoring of the pilot sites and is responsible for the hosting of the EVVE software and all pilot traffic from the 26 states to the HUB and return. They are responsible for invoicing all payments to the 8 pilot states including tracking all usage. The pilots cannot continue without direct involvement from NAPHSIS. The Association is currently developing a Vital Event Transaction, which will serve as the standardized format for all state vital records. This functionality will meet the verification needs (electronically) of the documentation needed in claims processing.  NAPHSIS meets the goal of electronic nationwide access for SSA users of vital statistics data.  NAPHSIS is the only known national organization that: 1) develops vital records policy and procedures directly with its members, the state registrars; 2) has the relationships and trust needed to develop with the state agencies a new public policy in regards to online access pilots, tailored to states' concerns; 3) can provide a forum and a process for resolving states' concerns; 4) can develop an acceptable pilot; and 5) can successfully convince states to reassess their reluctance to work in an online environment.  NAPHSIS is the only known organization that can provide electronic online access to the following data elements on the State's system of vital records, as available the minimum data elements are: a) child's first, middle and last name; b) child's surname suffix; c) date of birth; d) sex; e) place of birth: town and/or county and state; f) father's first and last name; g) mother's first name and maiden name; h) birth certificate number or state file number and i) recordation and correction (if any) dates.  Also, the following Death Record Elements apply: a) decedent's first, middle and last names; b) date of death; c) place of death--town and/or county and state; d) death certificate number; e) decedent's social security number; f) date of birth; g) manner of death; h) father's surname; and i) recordation and correction (if any) dates.  No solicitation document exists; therefore, requests for such will not be honored.  Interested sources with actual experience must be able to substantiate their ability to meet all of the above characteristics.  Specific examples and reference contacts in the area of obtaining information regarding births and deaths encompassing all 50 States and U.S. Territories must be cited.  Interested sources must also summarize and provide an overview of the content of their database, including an overview of each organization claimed to represent an actual recent example of your experience, including references that specify a contact name and address.   If after April 7, 2003 at 3:00 p.m. Eastern time, no viable responses have been received in response to this announcement, SSA intends to negotiate solely with NAPHSIS pursuant to FAR subpart 6.302-1 which states, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Respondents should refer to VITAL2003.

 KENYA HORTICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

NOTIFICATION OF FUTURE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP)

USAID/Kenya announces its intention later this year to invite proposals for the implementation of a new Kenya Horticulture Development Project (KHDP).  The goal of the project is to increase the productivity of smallholder horticulture and to improve the efficiency of the value chain, leading to increased rural household incomes.  This goal will be achieved through four components: a) increased horticultural productivity; b) increased horticulture trade and access to markets; c) strengthened private sector business development service provision; and d) expanded and strengthened smallholder organizations capabilities to provide services to their member-owners.

A range of activities is anticipated under the project as follows: i) introducing appropriate technologies and adding value; ii) improving production and post-harvest handling; iii) strengthening of services for farmers, traders, other actors along the value chain, with an emphasis on private sector providers; iv) facilitating domestic, regional and international marketing; v) developing and strengthening of smallholder farmer organizations; vi) improving policy environment; and vii) developing consumer awareness and public outreach.

The KHDP will take into consideration the impact of the proposed activities on the environment and institute mitigation measures to minimize negative impacts.  The project is also expected to address gender disparities that prevail in the smallholder horticulture farming across the value chain.  The implementing agencies of the KHDP will use a business development services (BDS) approach that develops markets for the demand and supply of identified services across the value chain, and will work through service providers as a facilitator rather than as a direct player in the services market.

It is expected that there will be a lead organization that develops a project proposal with a limited consortium of agencies, including Kenyan organizations, to carry out the multiple elements of the project.  There will also be very close collaboration with other related USAID projects on dairy, maize, agricultural policy research, BDS, and in particular with relevant Government of Kenya institutions.

End of project expected results include increased productivity (kgs/acre), increased value and volume of trade in domestic, Africa region and international markets; strengthened capacity of smallholder and trade associations; improved access to goods and services by formal and informal horticultural enterprises; institutionalized value chain approach; enabling policy environment for horticulture production and markets in place. 

The Request for Proposals (RFP) is projected to be issued early May 2003. USAID will not entertain questions until after the RFP is issued.  It is the responsibility of the party downloading the RFP to ensure that it has been received in its entirety, and USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from the transmission or conversion process. When the RFP is issued, any amendments thereof will be posted on the internet, and interested parties should check the website regularly. The publication of this notice or the RFP does not obligate the U.S. Government to make an award.

(v)  The contract line item and reseach specifications are as follows:  CLIN 1. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIRED FIELDWORK:  The primary object of this research is to test respondents' familiarity with and reactions to individual musical selections, as identified by brief, easily recognizable excerpts, usually lasting between 5 and 10 seconds in length.

(b) Sample universe shall be the adult populations between the ages of 17 and 28 (inclusive) of the following cities:  Amman, Cairo, and Abu Dhabi.  Research in all three cities shall take place weekly. (c)  In the initial stage of sampling, recognized probability techniques shall be used to select households for screening to ascertain the presence of eligible household members.  In the event that a selected household does not contain any members eligible for this study, or eligible members within the household refuse to participate, successive additional households shall be identified, again based on recognized probability techniques, until a substitute respondent has been successfully recruited.  In no case shall more than one respondent be drawn from the same household.  (d) Screening criteria and quotas: All respondents shall fall in the SES categories A, B, C1, or C2, as these categories are commonly defined by market research agencies in the countries concerned.  Proportions of each week's sample in each group should roughly follow the underlying population distribution; in no case should the total proportion of A/B individuals in a weekly sample exceed 20%.  Each weekly sample should be approximately half male and half female.  In addition, approximately half of each weekly sample should be between the ages of 17-22 (inclusive) with the other half between the ages of 23 and 28 (inclusive).  All respondents should listen to music at least one hour per week and should listen to music on the radio at least 30 minutes per week.  All potential respondents shall be screened for musical preferences, and all who dislike contemporary Western music shall be eliminated from the sample.  (e) Interviews shall take place in the respondent's home, with interviewer playing musical hooks on a CD or tape player provided by the contractor.  (f) Interviewers shall employ a questionnaire requiring respondent to indicate familiarity with each song played, as well as favorability rating for each song with which respondent is familiar.  The questionnaire will contain up to five minutes of additional questions, to be determined by IBB in consultation with the awardee.  (g) Approximately 70 songs shall be tested each week, using hooks to be provided by IBB. It is expected that weekly compilation of hooks will be provided electronically to contractor as MP3 files.  RESPONSIBILITIES OF CONTRACTOR: The contractor shall be responsible for the project design, drafting, translation, formatting, adaptation, and printing of the survey instruments; developing the sampling plan and screening procedures; training interviewers; supervising fieldwork; cleaning and encoding survey responses; entering and processing the data; preparing tabulations in data books; submitting data in electronic form, and communicating all necessary information and results to IBB, Office of Research in a timely manner.

<DESC>NA United States Army Yuma Proving Ground (USAYPG) has requirement to establish several competitive Telecommunications Outside Plant Basic Order Agreements (TOSPBOA).  All terms and conditions in the TOSPBOAs will be in accordance with Federal Acquisition Reg ulations (FAR) Part 12, for commercial acquisition. BOAs will require delivery and installation primarily within USAYPG test ranges, however; other military installations within the desert southwest may use the resultant BOAs within scope. Each BOA will be  for a period of five-years and the estimated value of contracts to be awarded between the successful BOA holders during the 5-year period is $12 million. Work shall consist of providing all supervision; plant and materials to deliver installed modernized military telecommunication infrastructures throughout USAYPG test ranges and other desert southwest military installations. Working conditions in the desert southwest range from 65-115 degrees F with an average summer temperature of 102 degrees F.  Soil co nditions range from bare, steep, bedrock mountain blocks, gravel and sand plains with elevations ranging from 200-2,778 feet and cover a 1,400 square-mile area of the Sonora Desert. Contracts will be competed among the successful BOA holders; however, the government reserves the right to award contracts without competition when circumstances warrant. This request for proposal (RFP) is a 100% small business set-aside under SIC 3669 and NAICS 334290 (750 employees or less).  The first competitive contract pla ced under the TOSPBOA will be as a result of this RFP evaluation and the selection of the BOA holders. We anticipate selecting up to 5 BOA holders; however; the actual number of BOAS placed shall be based on selection of the highest-rated contractors at a logical break in the ratings. You may download a copy of the RFP from our website http://www.yuma.army.mil/contracting/rfp.html. If you have any questions, E-mail Jacque.Phillips@yuma.army.mil.

NOTES TO OFFERORS

l. "Or equals"	cannot be accepted for this acquisition; please submit your quote for only the items specified.						
2. Please quote all items as F.O.B. Destination			

3. This acquisition is being conducted under the procedures described at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 8.404 for a GSA acquisition, FAR 16.505 for a GWAC acquisition, or FAR 12 and 13 for an open market acquisition.

4. At this time we are asking offerors to submit pricing on the items described above, per the terms of your GSA contract, or other GWAC contract.  For this acquisition we are also accepting open market pricing, if your business is classified as a Small Business, or Small Disadvantaged Business.
NOTE:  If you are classified as a Large Business, we cannot accept open market pricing from you."

5. Special price discounts from your GSA or GWAC contract are certainly encouraged.

6. In accordance with FAR Subpart 39.106,  Year 2000 compliance, the items to be acquired as a result of this RFQ must be Year 2000 compliant.  It is anticipated that the items will be required to perform date/time processing involving dates subsequent to December 31, 1999.

7. Have you registered in the Contractor Central Registration (CCR) database yet?  If not, please ensure that your firm is registered.  If you are not registered, you are not eligible for further acquisitions.  Please contact the buyer if you require further information.

8. We at MacDill 6 Contracting SQ/LGCb are becoming more experienced with utilizing the numerous federal contractual vehicles which are available for the products and services we buy.  GSA schedules are recommended to us by the Department of Defense (DoD).  While we still invite GSA offers, we realize that there are many other contractual vehicles (GWAC’s) which may offer advantages over GSA, and we would like to be aware of  these alternatives as well.

9. Some GWAC’s are easier for us to use than others. Therefore, we must take into consideration the administrative burden involved with placing a delivery order against any given GWAC or GSA contract.  Generally, DoD GWAC’s are easier to use than non-DoD GWAC’s, because of application of the Economy Act. Whenever we wish to place an order against a non-DoD contract (with the exception of GSA), the Economy Act requires us to perform a somewhat lengthy and time consuming process of research, evaluation, and high level briefing and approval before the purchase can be made. This law therefore stands as an impediment to our ability to take advantage of many GWAC’s. However, if a non-DoD GWAC offers significant advantages, we will use it if it is in our best interest. Some GWAC’s, including many within DoD, do not let us place a direct delivery order, but rather require the transference of funds (MIPR) to the cognizant contracting office. This can be an administrative burden as well, and must be considered in the award decision.

10. We encourage you to offer us several different alternatives for this acquisition, if you desire.  Also, if you have any helpful suggestions as to how we may improve this internet-based RFQ method, please let us know.

Thank you very much for your participation!

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology (LMCB), plans to procure a Singer MSM System 300 Tetrad Dissection Microscope from Singer Instrument Co. Ltd., Roadwater, Watchet, Somerset TA23 0RE England, United Kingdom. The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. The Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology (LMCB) investigates basic cellular processes of homeostasis, growth, division and differentiation, with an emphasis on the genetic and molecular biology of chromosomes and the cell nucleus. Accordingly, LCMB is engaged in research on the structure of chromatin and how chromatin is packaged to regulate gene expression and maintain genomic integrity.  The research involves the identification and characterization of interactions of chromosomal proteins and genes and the effects of these interactions on gene expression. Specifically, the project analyzes proteins involved in organization of the genome into higher-order structures and their effects on genome wide gene expression and maintenance of genomic integrity. This research involves extensive use of yeast genetic techniques, and requires a reliable tetrad dissection microscope system to manipulate the individual cells/spores produced from genetic crosses.  The unique computerized control offered by Singer MSM 300 Tetrad Dissection System permits several functions that are not possible with other systems. For example, this system allows automation of repetitive aspects of the procedures described above.  The microprocessor controller which, with its built in program for yeast manipulations, operates the motor driven stage automatically.  The microprocessor always remembers the place that a cell or spore was deposited on the matrix allowing returning to same matrix points at later times for periodic observation of growing cells. Moreover, this system includes a high quality integral microscope and an easy to operate micromanipulator.  The trinocular head of the microscope allows easy fitting of the CCTV and camera provided with this system, which is invaluable for techniques involving time-lapse image capture of cells.  The X15 widefield eyepiece are coupled with a special XLWD X20 flatfield objectives; the ideal combination for yeast dissections and observation.  Other unique features of this system include a LWD condenser with an anti-convection stage window and a hinged microscope overarm for easy loading of petri dishes containing yeast cultures.  Finally, this is the only system that comes with a micro-zapper, an electronically controlled device that is necessary for efficient separation of spores during tetrad dissections.  The Singer MSM System 300 Tetrad Dissection System is the only known piece of equipment on the market that meets the flexible requirements necessary for this type of research.  Singer Instrument Company is the only source known to the NCI that can provide an instrument that can give the lab the capability and flexibility to conduct the described research.  More specifically, the Singer MSM 300 computer-controlled tetrad dissection system shall allow NCI to automate many of the repetitive aspects of the necessary procedures such as the pedigree analysis of single cells, cell and zygote isolation, cell cycle progression of mutant cells and the genetic analysis of meiotic progeny produced during genetic crosses. This instrument shall allow the laboratory the capability to perform genetic analysis of highly conserved chromosomal proteins in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and to elucidate the function of these proteins in higher-order chromatin assembly and in regulating gene activity.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above supplies, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above minimum specifications described herein.  Capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EST (local Washington D.C. time) on April 10, 2003.   If you have questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@excange.nih.gov or by fax at (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is Amendment 0002 for a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items that was originally issued on 20 February 2003 and is hereby amended as follows: A.  The time by which offers must be received is changed from 1:00 PM Eastern Standard Time to 2:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. (The closing date, 21APR03, is unchanged.) B.  In Addendum 2 to the solicitation, Page 1 of 5 is corrected to change Item 0000 to Item 0009. C.  In Addendum 4 to the solicitation, the first sentence of Paragraph A.3. is deleted and replaced by the following two sentences:  Separate proposals are required for each MD/NS subsystem being proposed.  Variants within each subsystem may be proposed within that subsystem proposal.  Each proposal shall include five (5) copies of Volume 1 and two (2) copies of Volume 2, 3 and 4. D.  In Addendum 4 to the solicitation, the second sentence of Parag raph D is deleted and replaced by the following: If the offeror is a small business, this volume shall describe the extent to which your company has identified and committed to provide for participation by small, small and disadvantaged businesses (SDB), woman owned businesses (WOB), historically black colleges and universities, or other minority institutions for the performance of this effort.  The Offeror shall provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the tasks assigned the selected small and/or SDB and WOB subcontractors are meaningful in the sense that they will be performing functions important to the overall success of the program and also broaden the subcontractor's technical capability.   The offeror shall describe their management approach for enhancing small, SDB and WOB subcontractor's technical capability.   Of special interest is the amount and type of  work to be performed by the subcontractors.  The offeror shall explain the reasons for and advantages of selecting particular subcontractors. E.  The solicitation states that “Initial inspection of the required supplies shall be performed by the cognizant DCMA and/or NSWC personnel at the contractor’s/sub-contractor’s facility.  Final inspection and acceptance shall be at NSWC Crane.”  This statement applies to all deliveries on the future contracts including prototypes and production hardware. F.  Additional details concerning the Oral Presentations/Demonstrations (as set forth in Addendum 3) are as follows: Oral Presentation/Demonstration:  Formal scheduling of the Oral Presentation/Demonstration will be conducted shortly after the solicitation closes.  The Government will notify each offeror of the date and time of the Oral Presentation/Demonstration at least two  weeks prior to the scheduled date.  The number of offeror representatives for each Oral Presentation/Demonstration shall not exceed six.  In order to facilitate the source selection process, the Government intends to schedule the Oral Presentation/Demonstration by MDNS subsystem rather than by offeror.  Offerors shall have up to 2 hours to present Powerpoint presentations, conduct any product demonstrations, and allow for a question and answer period.  It is anticipated that it will be possible for offerors to conduct limited operational demonstrations of passive devices, visible bright lights, and Class 3A lasers.  The Government is currently investigating the possibility of more detailed demonstrations at a range yet to be determined.   G.  The changes below have resulted in a revised Statement of Work (SOW) and Performance Specification, which are attached and available  for downloading.  The SOW and Performance Specification were originally published as Addendum 1, Section 2 and Addendum 1, Section 3 of the solicitation.  The information shown below is only a summary of the changes made to the attached SOW and Performance Specification.

Subsequent paragraphs renumbered. 3) Paragraph 3.3.18 Non-Warranty Repair:  Since it is not the government’s intent to fund spare parts or float stock for repair, the last sentence of paragraph 3.3.18 will be removed. PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION CHANGES: 1) Paragraph 1.2 Project Definition:  Table was changed to include o nly MDNS Development elements.  Additionally, a note was added which clarifies the scope of this procurement.  A reference to BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT N00164-01-R-0155 was made for offerors interested in submitting proposals for ancillary items that may enhance the SOPMOD capability that are not included in this solicitation. 2) Paragraph 3.2.18 Tools:  The objective requirement to eliminate the use of tools was deleted. 3) Paragraph 3.2.21 Resistance to Electromagnetic Interference:  This paragraph has been removed.  However, note that Paragraph 3.4.1, which references Electromagnetic Performance Parameters remains. 4) Paragraph 3.3.1.3 CNVD:  The requirement for CNVD mounting and compatibility was clarified in paragraphs 3.3.1.3.1.1.1, 3.3.1.3.1.1.2, and 3.3.1.3.1.2.6.  Additionally, the objective weight requirement was corrected in paragraph 3.3.1.3.1.1.3. 5) Pa ragraph 3.3.2.1 VBL III:  The VBL brightness requirement was clarified in paragraph 3.3.2.1.1.2.3.

Additionally, the 10-30 page requirement has been removed.   H.

The successful offerors will be encouraged to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. The intent of this contract is that all Contractors participate in walk-thrus and submit proposals on each task order. Failure to participate may result in the Government exercising its right NOT to award an option period.  Participation in the pre-proposal conference or site visits for future task orders would be the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government. Task orders would require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement. Projects would also require incorporation of sustainable features. Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.

Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals would not be considered for an award. The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution; Small Business Subcontracting Effort; and other factors that define the quality of construction. Cost and Price proposal may include total cost; evaluation of scope/design options with the Government’s published budget for award. The best value proposal will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts. The other IDIQ contract(s) will be awarded to the design-build offeror(s) who provide the next most competitive proposal(s). A minimum guarantee of $50,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract(s). The minimum guarantee will be payable only if the offeror(s) are awarded no task orders over the five (5) year contract term. Task orders would be competed among the three to four firms that were awarded an IDIQ, with each task order awarded based on best value or lowest price technically acceptable proposal. The seed project for this solicitation is for the Repairs to Visiting Quarters, Building 438, Naval Air Facility Key West, FL.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Jennifer Hill, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-3083
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   SYNOPSIS IS AMENDED TO CORRECT THE METHOD FOR ANALYSIS.  The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with University of Alberta, Department of Public Health Sciences, 13-301 Clinical Sciences Building, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada for analyzing 2600 urine samples for total arsenic content and arsenic species.  Total arsenic shall be determined using an Ion Coupled Plasma, Mass Spectrometric (ICPMS) technique.   The arsenic species arsenite, arsenate, monomethylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid shall be determined using a  High Performance Liquid Chromatography / Hydride Generation / Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (HPLC/HG/AFS) method developed by Dr. X. C. Le.  The contractor shall provide the EPA the results of the analyses in a written report.  The period of performance is anticipated to be within 12 months from  date of award.  EPA believes that the University of Alberta is the only source capable of providing the required services based on their development of the analysis method, the unique ability to measure arsenic species in a urine  matrix without diluting the sample, and their ability to provide  comparable results to previous analyses for the Arsenic in Drinking Water and Diet Study.   EPA has identified University of Alberta as the only source with the necessary background and expertise to perform the required services within the prescribed time frame, i.e., FAR 6.3020-1, "only one  responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should submit a written proposal within 7 days from the date of this amended announcement.  The North American Industry Classification  System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a small business size standard of $6.0 million is applicable.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exists, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently any response failing to provide the aforementioned data but  instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Submit responses via the Postal Service to USEPA, Attn: Jennifer Hill (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC  27711 or via courier service to USEPA, Attn: Jennifer  Hill (E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 4930 Page Road, Durham, NC  27703.  No telephonic or faxed request will be honored.

<DESC>PSC Military Housing Company (PCSMHC), acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), and the Air Force Space Command, is pleased to announce the release of its Request for Proposals for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at Buckley Air Force Base, Colorado.  Please note that "Step One" proposals are due no later than 5:00 p.m. local time 23 April 2003, at the offices of PSCMHC.  PSCMHC intends to employ a two-step RFP process.  In the first step, each prospective offeror (or offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources and a brief summary of its approach to the Buckley AFB project.  PSCMHC, with Air Force concurrence, will pre-qualify those offerors that satisfactorily demonstrate their financial and technical capability and understanding of the requirements of the Buckley project.  In the second step, up to five qualified offerors will be invited to submit fully specified technical and financial proposals.  PSCMHC will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Successful Offeror (SO) to the Air Force.

The Buckley Project involves the construction of 332 units on existing vacant land.  The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 332 unit housing community for a lease period of at least 50 years.  The Air Force expects to contribute leased real property without any improvements, and may subsidize the project's financing to the degree necessary to enter into an agreement with the successful private offeror.  The Successful Offeror (SO) will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the Buckley family housing inventory.  Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the SO will be entitled to a portion of the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the SO.  This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  The RFP is available at http://www.pscmhc.com.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources to provide engineering services to support the Excalibur XM982 Program and the merged Excalibur/TCM program with High G on-board recording (OBR) systems. Specifically, TACOM-ARDEC has a qualified design that needs to be produced. A formal drawing package does not exist and units are required  immediately. This recorder, the ARRT-114 which was developed at ARDEC, is capable of recording harsh in-bore cannon environments. The recorder is capable of recording 16 non-multiplexed channels sampled up to 500Khz each. Data is stored in RAM for later extraction. The recorder triggers with a G-switch and is programmed with a 30 minute delay in order to load the projectile in gun. The dimensions of the board electronics are 3.75 in. diameter by 3 in. long. The Government is seeking qualified sources to build, test and troubleshoot these previously purchased hardware (OBR). Responses should consist of company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, fax number, description of item and company brochures/literature regarding contractor capability. Interested companies are encouraged to submit their responses and ideas to the POC. This notice is not a request for proposal. Participation in this market survey will not effect a company's position during any future solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or  otherwise pay for the information provided. No basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this market survey or Government use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey. See Note 25.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management proposes to negotiate a noncompetitive award of a contract with Otto Schumacher/Western Mine Engineering, Inc. of Spokane, Washington to perform an economic analysis for the mining claim validity examination of the Nicore Project near Cave Junction, Oregon.  The Nicore Project involves a Court-ordered validity examination of 151 placer mining claims covering 4,380 acres in mountainous terrain. The claims are allegedly valuable for such minerals as nickel, copper, cobalt, chrome, and iron; these minerals are found in a laterite surface deposit caused by the weathering of the parent rock which enriched the metallic content near the surface. The economic analysis shall include developing a resource model to verify claimant's estimate of resources, verification of proposed mining and reclamation operations, capital and operating cost verification, feasibility verification of metallurgical process, market analysis of proposed product, financial analysis to verify claimant's cash-flow analysis, and final report. Otto Schumacher/Western Mine Engineering, Inc. has been selected to provide the work because of its extensive participation in the validity examination from the beginning and because it is the only contractor known to possess all of the following qualifications needed to meet the Bureau's requirements:  (1) ability to analyze and synthesize assay data to develop a resource model in terms of grade distributions and spatial variability of grade using industry standard methodology; (2) ability to verify proposed mining and reclamation operations in terms of access, facilities, utilities, mining methodology, ore processing, waste disposal, and reclamation; (3) ability to estimate costs of such items as infrastructure, equipment, processing plant, mining, processing of ore, labor, supplies, administrative costs, and reclamation; (4) ability to have credible metallurgists determine the feasibility of the metallurgical process; (5) ability to perform an independent market analysis for the proposed product; (6) ability to review and verify claimant's discounted cash flow analysis and perform an independent analysis taking into consideration items such as appropriate production, cost and price information, tax requirements, calculation of NPV, payback and IROR at multiple appropriate discount rates, and sensitivity analyses for critical economic parameters; and (7) prepare a report to the standards established in BLM Manual Section 3891 and the Mineral Examiners Handbook H 3890-1. Firms which meet the above requirements should submit their qualifications in writing specifically addressing the seven criteria described above to the Contracting Officer. All responses received within thirty days will be considered.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Design, Fabrication & Assembly Services 
for
Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) Process Units


Duke Cogema Stone & Webster, LLC (DCS) is seeking companies with experience in design and/or fabrication of gloveboxes, including the integration of mechanical, electrical and instrumentation components to form an assembly that performs a set of process functions.  The integrated assembly is referred to as a Process Unit.  The Process Units to be acquired will support the construction of a Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) to be built at the Department of Energy (DOE) Savannah River Site (SRS).  For the MFFF, a Process Unit is a single glovebox or series of connected gloveboxes along with the associated process equipment (conveyors, rotating doors, drives, elevators, sensors, other single function machines, etc.) contained within the glovebox confinement boundary and the support equipment (gearboxes, motors, MCCs, PLCs, etc.) located external to the glovebox confinement boundary.  DCS is in the stage of the project where acquisition planning activities must begin.  A major procurement initiative for the MFFF is the acquisition of the Process Units.  Approximately 30 Process Units could be acquired under a design/build contractual arrangement, and between 25 and 60 Process Units could be acquired under a build-to-print contractual arrangement.  The projected total value of all work is in the range of $150 to $300 million dollars.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center is soliciting information regarding the availability of sources capable to serve as a primary support contractor for the NASA Advanced Satellite Aviation-weather Products Initiative. The future contractor will be required to conduct research and transfer meteorological satellite data processing technology for the purpose of enhancing aviation weather products to be used to conduct a Geosynchronous Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer (GIFTS) Aviation Demonstration. The purpose of this work is to produce aviation weather hazard graphic products to be used in the GIFTS aviation product demonstration. The hazardous weather graphics currently displayed by AWIN, i.e., Icing, Convective Weather, Turbulence, etc., have already been produced by the FAA Aviation Weather Research Program (AWRP).  To conduct the GIFTS Aviation Demonstration, ASAP will improve or add to the AWRP's suite of hazardous weather graphic products.  The effort will be begin with the enhancement of current aviation-weather products with Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite (POES) data and processing techniques. This work will then evolve to encompass hyperspectral sounding data and advanced imagery that will be provided by the next generation of meteorological satellites such as GIFTS and GOES-R. The NASA Aviation Safety Program maintains a Memorandum of Agreement with the FAA to support aviation weather hazard research. ASAP is utilizing this MOA to collaborate with the FAA AWRP to enhance hazardous weather graphics produced by the AWRP through the infusion of current-and next-generation meteorological satellite data. The work will require enhancement of FAA AWRP Products to facilitate the demonstration rather than undertake the costly and riskier process of trying to produce these products from scratch.	Because of the groundbreaking nature and scope of the ASAP initiative, the benchmark for determining whether the contractor has the capability to produce the full range of products described in the ASAP study report is as follows: Those responding to this Sources Sought Synopsis shall have demonstrated leadership in: (1) research related to atmospheric radiative transfer, satellite meteorology, and numerical weather prediction; (2) the dedicated production of meteorological satellite methods, algorithms and applications thereof; (3) developing operational products from environmental satellites for improved monitoring of the earth-atmosphere; (4) conducting research using passive remote sensing systems for geostationary and polar orbiting meteorological satellite, airborne and surface-based applications; (5) the daily utilization of large data sets from current operational geostationary and polar orbiting meteorological satellites; (6) developing ground based and airborne hyperspectral, interferometric instrumentation similar to that being developed as the GIFTS sounder; (7) developing ground based and airborne hyperspectral, interferometric sounding retrieval algorithms similar to those which might be used to support the GIFTS Measurement Concept for radiance, temperature, water vapor, and wind retrievals. The goal of ASAP is to conduct a robust GIFTS aviation product demonstration to enhance aviation safety. Information regarding the NASA GIFTS Project can be found at: http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/eo3/.  The route to that demonstration is to integrate current and new geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite information into the FAA AWRP PDT's suite of weather products. Information regarding the FAA AWRP can be found at: http://www1.faa.gov/aua/awr/.  ASAP shall fully enable the FAA AWRP PDT's to posses the capability to utilize environmental satellite data sets to develop the aviation weather products required for the demonstration.  All offerors shall have the capability to serve as the primary support contractor for the NASA Advanced Satellite Aviation-weather Products Initiative from 2003 through September 2005. Those responding shall be able to begin development of ASAP detection algorithms in FY2003, and will assist in the incorporation, implementation and testing of these algorithms into the FAA AWRP forecasting systems in FY2004 and FY2005.  Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement of 5 pages (12 point font)or less, excluding reference material, indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein and submitted to: NASA Langley Research Center, ATTN:  John J. Murray, Mail Stop 401B, Building 1250, Room 205, Hampton, VA 23681-2199.  The preferred method of submission is a Microsoft Word document (Office 2000) via e-mail to johnj.murray@nasa.gov. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Technical questions should be directed to: John J. Murray, at (757) 864-5883 or via e-mail to john.j.murray@nasa.gov.   Procurement related questions should be directed to: Tom Weih at (757) 864-3878 or via e-mail at c.t.weih@larc.nasa.gov.
