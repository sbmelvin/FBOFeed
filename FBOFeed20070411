<DESC>The Naval Air Station has a requirement for the lease, maintenance, installation, of the Intrusion Detection, Fire Alarm Communication, Access Control and CCTV systems, that are essential to support the Department of Public Safety, Naval Air Station, Patuxent River, MD and Webster Field Annex, St. Inigoes, MD.  This contract will provide for lease and maintenance services for approximately 270 locations on the Naval Air Station, Patuxent River Complex and Webster Field Annex.  The Government contemplates a firm fixed price contract.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with ADT Security Services, Inc. 3601 Eisenhower Ave, 3rd Floor, Alexandria, VA 22304 under the authority of FAR 6.301-1.  ADT Security Services is the sole developer and manufacturer of the existing system.  ADT equipment and maintenance service capabilities meet the stringent requirements of the Defense Intelligence Agency Manual (DIAM) 50-3.  In addition, NAS PAXRIVINST 5530.6, Chapter III, Section III-4, e., requires that all Intrusion Detection, Fire Alarm Communication, and Access Control Systems procured to protect classified information must be compatible with the computerized monitoring equipment at the Naval Air Station Emergency Dispatch Center, building 2184.  The computerized monitoring equipment utilized by the Department of Public Safety was developed by ADT at their own expense, and they have retained data rights as proprietary.  The Government has no rights to the design of the equipment or components making up this system.  Therefore, ADT is the only manufacturer that is capable of providing the required lease and maintenance service.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposal.  However, interested parties may submit a capability statement.  All capability statements received in response to this notice will be considered by the Government for the purpose of determining whether to initiate a competitive procurement.  The Government reserves the right to process this procurement as a sole source based on the response received.  NOTE: DFARS 252-204-7004 Alt A “Required Central Contractor Registration” applies to all solicitations.  Lack of registration in CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  If a competitive procurement is initiated, it will be made available electronically at the NAVAIR website, http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/index.cfm.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER:  The Agricultural Health Study (AHS) is one of the hallmark efforts currently underway on agricultural health in the United States.  The study was initiated in 1993 by 3 lead organizations including:  The National Cancer Institute (NCI), The National Institute of Environmental Health Scientists (NIEHS), and The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The study uses a longitudinal cohort design and evaluates how lifestyle habits, genetic factors, and agricultural exposures at work and in the environmental contribute to the risk of disease.  Over 89,000 certified farmer pesticide applicators and their spouses from North Carolina and Iowa and licensed commercial pesticide applicators from Iowa are included in the study making it one of the largest agricultural health studies ever conducted in the United States.  The AHS is now in the third round.  Initial study efforts focused on pesticide exposures in the etiology of various cancers.  However, more recent efforts have begun to address other health outcomes including kidney disease, nervous system disorders, reproductive effects, and respiratory disease.  This large cohort provides a unique opportunity for the study of respiratory health outcomes in agriculture including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and chronic bronchitis with the study of both prevalent and incident disease patterns as well as risk factors related to pesticide and non-pesticide exposures.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) plans to contribute funding directly to the two contractors selected for the field testing of respiratory questions/questionnaires for this third round of the AHS.  The respiratory disease portions of the study will be conducted by the Battelle Memorial Institute in Baltimore, MD for the North Carolina Field Station and the University of Iowa, College of Public Health, Iowa City, IA, for the Iowa Field Station.  These two contractors were selected through a competition by the NCI, EPA, and NIEHS to complete the third round of the questionnaire surveys.  Only these approved NCI/EPA/NIEHS contractors would have access to the databases / study participant rosters to complete these interviews including the respiratory health questionnaire components.  Additionally, these contractors have experience with this large cohort and have demonstrated competency during previous surveys.  This notice is being posted for information purposes only.  All information received will be considered by the Government.

<DESC><b>REQUIREMENT:</b><br>
General Services Administration is interested in leasing approximately 3,990 rentable square feet  which will produce approximately 3,450 BOMA usable square feet for the Veterans Benefit Administration.  Onsite parking is required in accordance with local city codes with no additional cost to the government and 3 parking spaces are to be assigned for official use.<br><br>
The need for this space is directly related to VA’s Strategic Goal One: Restore the capability of veterans with disabilities to the greatest benefit possible and improve the quality of their lives and the lives of their families.<br><br>
The Veterans administration objective is to provide eligible service-connected disabled veterans with an opportunity to become employable and obtain and maintain employment while the VA delivers special support to  these veterans with serious employment handicaps.<br><br>
<b>LEASE TERM:</b> 10 years, 5 years firm.<br><br>
<b>UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS:</b><br>
All space must be contiguous on one floor and have highly refined ADA requirements.<br><br>
Veterans’ access to VR&E information and benefits is critical to the success of the program which requires a close relationship between VA personnel and veterans, almost always involving face-to-face contact.  This relationship hinges on veterans having easy and improved access to VA personnel.  This office will serve a population of 55,000 veterans.  Locating the counselors close to the veteran population minimizes travel for veterans to obtain services leading to their successful employment.  It has been our experience that a higher percentage of veterans appear for appointments when access to services is convenient and nearby.<br><br>
<b>LOCATION:</b><br>
Offered properties must be located within the city limits.<br><br>
<b>EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:</b><br>
1)  Building name and address<br>
2)  Square footage offered<br>
3)  Method of Measurement used to determine rentable square feet.<br>
4)  Name, address, and telephone number of individual to be contacted<br>
5)  Evidence of authority to represent the owner.<br><br>
<b>AUTHORIZED CONTACTS:</b><br>
In no event shall the offer enter into negotiations concerning the space to be leased with representatives of Federal Agencies other than the officers and employees of General Services Administration.<br><br>

Cognitive Technology Threat Warning Systems (CT2WS);

Teaming Website: http://www.sainc.com/CT2WSTeaming/

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office (DSO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for CT2WS. The objective of the CT2WS program is to drive a breakthrough in soldier-portable visual threat warning devices. Recent developments and discoveries in the disparate technology areas of flat-field, wide-angle optics, large pixel-count digital imagers, cognitive visual processing algorithms, neurally-based target detection signatures and ultra-low power analog-digital hybrid signal processing electronics have led DARPA to believe that focused technology development, system design, and system integration efforts may produce revolutionary capabilities for the warfighter. The final objective of the DARPA CT2WS program is the development of prototype soldier-portable digital imaging threat queuing systems capable of effective detection ranges of 1-10 km against dismounts and vehicles while simultaneously surveying a 120-degree or greater field of view (FOV). The system is envisioned to queue the operator to potential threats in the FOV; target identification is presumed to be a subsequent action taken by the user/operator and is not a required function of the CT2WS system. DARPA is not aware of any single company or institution capable of spanning the requisite technical breadth and anticipates that a highly interdisciplinary team will be required to perform the effort and deliver several prototype soldier-portable units. A teaming website, http://www.sainc.com/CT2WSTeaming/, will facilitate the formation of teams with the necessary expertise.

DARPA requests proposals for the full scope of development (e.g., an end-to-end system designed by a team of multidisciplinary research organizations, plus an integrator for coordination and implementation support). Proposals addressing only individual component-level technologies may be considered noncompliant to this BAA. 

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fbo.gov and/or www.grants.gov. Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections from proposals that are submitted by 3:00PM ET, June 21, 2007. Proposers may submit a full proposal at any time up to the BAA closing date. In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA07-25) or to the online submission site, http://www.sainc.com/dsobaa/, on or before 3:00PM ET, June 21, 2007. (NOTE: University-led grant submissions may be made via the Grants.gov web site, http://www.grants.gov by using the “apply for Grants” functions. Dual submissions are not required.)

The Government encourages responses to this BAA by non-traditional Defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), large businesses and Government laboratories. Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for organizations of a specific business classification due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought. Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per PL 103-337 § 217 and PL 105-261 § 3136. Any responsible and otherwise qualified offeror is encouraged to respond.

Proposers may include foreign personnel as part of their proposed resources as long as these personnel qualify technically, export control laws are complied with, the proposed effort is unclassified, and such foreign personnel sign any and all appropriate non-disclosure agreements prior to participating in the research effort.

This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Procurement Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or other such appropriate award instrument. The Government reserves the right to negotiate the type of award instrument determined appropriate under the circumstances.

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offer the best overall value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to award without discussion. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA. The Government also reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received; in that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal. The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.

EVALUATION CRITERIA
The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this project are in descending order of importance: (a) Technical Approach; (b) Management Approach; (c) Relevant Experience; (d) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission; and (e) Cost and Schedule Reasonableness and Realism. Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.

SECURITY
The Government anticipates proposals submitted under this BAA will be UNCLASSIFIED.  

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE
Additional information regarding program objectives, anticipated schedule, technical milestone criteria, required and suggested deliverables, and proposal preparation and submittal is provided in the PIP associated with this BAA. Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA must obtain the PIP associated with this BAA. These documents can be accessed at www.fbo.gov and/or www.grants.gov. This BAA and PIP together constitute the full BAA for this project.

NOTE: All questions should be sent to BAA07-25@darpa.mil.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is contemplating to solicit a proposal and negotiate a sole source bridge contract with Technology and Management Services, Inc., in the event that a follow-on competitive acquisition is not awarded in time to a successful offeror. The follow-on competitive acquisition began with the issuance of a Request for Quotation (RFQ) number DE-RQ01-07EE11182 to targeted vendors in accordance with procedures under FAR Subpart 8.4, GSA Federal Supply Service Schedules. The RFQ was issued on March 19, 2007. The proposed bridge contract will provide continued high quality professional and administrative services to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of Business Administration (DAS-BA). This support is currently being performed by Technology & Management Services under contract number DE-AC01-01EE10755 and will expire on April 25, 2007. The proposed contract will be for the purpose of bridging the period of performance between the expiration of the current contract and the placement of an order to a successful offeror in accordance with procedures under FAR Subpart 8.4, GSA Federal Supply Service Schedules. The mission of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Business Administration (DAS-BA) is to provide effective corporate management leadership based on clear communication, open information systems, prudent human resource management, and thorough analysis in the areas of planning, budget, and operations to facilitate the accomplishment of EERE's complex RD&D portfolio.  The DAS-BA reports to the Assistant Secretary through the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary. The DAS-BA serves as the exclusive source for all EERE business products, processes, and systems and provides a full suite of business services to EERE's Assistant Secretary, Board of Directors, Office of Technology Advancement and Outreach, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Technology Development, and Program Management offices. The DAS-BA is supported by three offices â€” the Office of Program Execution Support, the Office of Planning, Budget, and Analysis, and the Office of Information and Business Management Systems. The DAS-BA also oversees the activities of the Golden Field Office. The effort by the contractor will provide the Office of the Assistant Secretary and the office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Business Administration the means to support the RD&D mission and vision of the EERE with Planning, Analysis, Systems Engineering, and related services support.  The services are generally described as to include, but not be limited to: Special Studies and Reports; Planning and Budget; Planning, Analysis, and Evaluation Support; System Engineering and Integration Support; Strategic Management System Support; Conference Management Support; Program Execution Support Office Assistance; and, Information and Business Management Support. The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this contract is Section 303[c][1] of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act, 41 USC 253[c][1], and implemented by FAR 6.302-1[a][2][ii][B], which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; and when it is likely that an award to any other source may result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencyâ€™s requirements. Technology & Management Services has the requisite number of key and non-key personnel possessing the technical skill and training who are familiar with the program and requirements, and who are available to provide services pending the award of a competitive follow-on contract. Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates: 1) the firm's ability to perform the work as described above; and 2) the firmâ€™s ability to provide the requisite personnel and be fully operational by April 26, 2007. Interested parties may submit a proposal and rationale as to why they should be considered within fifteen (15) days of this notice to: Linda Sapp, MA-642.1, 1000 Independence Ave, SW, Washington, DC 20585, or via e-mail to linda.sapp@hq.doe.gov. A determination by the Government not to proceed with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The intent of this award is to provide the required support services until the award and transition of a competitive follow-on acquisition is completed as described in the first paragraph above. The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) Code for this requirement is 541330. The period of performance of this bridge contract is for a total of one 30-day period.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. See Note(s) 26.    The United State (U.S.) Government intends to purchase the Unlimited Legal Rights to the engineering and technical data contained in the Interface Control Drawings (ICD) for M61 family of gun systems and related equipment. All technical data is intended for internal and external use and competition actions by the U.S Government.  The ICD will portray and explain all critical phases and constraints of the successful handling of 20MM ammunition throughout M61 family guns and related systems. The ICD will define a status for the F-15, F-16, F/A-18, F/A-22, and Mark-15 CIWS gun systems that employ the M61 family of guns.  Using these documents as a reference, engineers will be able to understand every aspect of handling 20mm ammunition thus minimizing the probability of interference issues in the years to come. At this time, according to the most current market research, General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products (GD-ATP) is only known source to the U.S. Government which owns the most current technical drawings that could satisfy the requirement describe above.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) had AHERA-equivalent inspections performed on all Rocky Mountain Region (Region 8) federally owned facilities the last several years, starting in 1980.  Since that time significant changes have been made to the buildings with no changes being made to the original asbestos inspection reports.  Additional bulk sampling is to be conducted in questionable areas.  All building related asbestos information is being tracked in a GSA web based database called the GSA Asbestos Management Information System (AMIS).  The purpose of this database is to provide a more efficient system to provide information to management for budget and project allocation decisions.

<CONTACT>Colleen Elliott, Contract Specialist, Phone (915) 832-4714, Fax (915) 832-4192, Email colleenelliott@ibwc.state.gov
<DESC>The United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) intends to acquire on the basis of Other Than Full and Open Competition water quality sampling, sediment sampling, benthic monitoring, and fish monitoring for the wastewater discharge to the Pacific Ocean through the South Bay Ocean Outfall in San Diego, San Diego County, California.  Laboratory services, data interpretation, trend analyses, as well as reporting for the sampling and monitoring program will be required.  This is a Notice of Intent to award a firm fixed-price contract for the above services to The City of San Diego, 600 B Street, San Diego, California 92101-4587, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-7, Public Interest.  In September 1997, the International Boundary and Water Commission constructed an International Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) in the City of San Diego, California to serve the city of Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.  This treatment plant was constructed under United States and Mexico Commission Minute No. 283, and is operated under the clauses contained in Commission Minute 296.  The IWTP receives and treats raw wastewater generated by the City of Tijuana, and discharges the treated effluent into the Pacific Ocean through a land Outfall pipeline, and Ocean Outfall.  The IWTP is operated under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit No. 96-50, issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board.  Identified within the NPDES permit is a Sampling, Monitoring and Reporting program for the receiving waters of the IWTP effluent which extends north and south over an area in the vicinity of the discharge point for the Ocean Outfall.  The requirements for the description of services of this document originate from the NPDES permit requirements for the IWTP.  In July 1990, the USIBWC entered into an agreement with the City of San Diego for sharing of design and construction costs of the South Bay Land Outfall.  Also, as part of this agreement, the USIBWC and the City of San Diego agreed to a 50/50 share in the ownership of the Land Outfall after completion of construction.  In January 1995, the USIBWC entered into an agreement with the City of San Diego for sharing of design and construction costs of the South Bay Ocean Outfall.  As part of this agreement, the USIBWC and the City of San Diego agreed to share in the ownership of the Ocean Outfall.  The ownership share of the Ocean Outfall is 0.3994 for the City of San Diego, and 0.6606 for the USIBWC.  The City of San Diego participated in the cost sharing of the Land and Ocean Outfalls to be able to use these facilities for their future South Bay Reclamation Treatment Plant.  The City’s South Bay Reclamation Plant was completed on May 6, 2002, and the City is discharging treated effluent through the South Bay Land Outfall and the South Bay Ocean Outfall to the Pacific Ocean.  The effluent from the two wastewater treatment plants, the ITWTP and the City Reclamation Plant, is combined and is indistinguishable after discharge into the Pacific Ocean.  The City of San Diego South Bay Reclamation Plant is operated under a NPDES discharge permit similar to the NPDES permit issued for the ITWP.  In recognition of the same discharge point for the combined effluent of the two treatment plants, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board has issued the city of San Diego a NPDES permit with a similar, and in many cases, identical, Sampling, Monitoring, and Reporting Program to that of the IWTP NPDES permit.  The City of San Diego currently operates an advanced primary wastewater treatment facility at Pt Loma, and the South Bay Reclamation wastewater facility within the City of San Diego.  Both treatment plants are operated under NPDES permits issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board and require Sampling, Monitoring, and Reporting Programs.  The City of San Diego has been conducting this sampling, monitoring and reporting program for many years, using their own equipment, resources, and staff.  Since the City of San Diego will be performing the Sampling, Monitoring, and Reporting Program for their own South Bay Reclamation Plant at many of the identical monitoring stations for the IWTP, the City of San Diego has expressed a willingness to cost share these two programs.  Significant savings to the federal government and the City of San Diego will be realized by sharing the two programs.  However, it is only if the City of San Diego is allowed to perform the work involved in the program, as the City does not intend to bid their portion of the work out, and will not share in the costs if the government solicits for a Contractor.  Savings to be realized will be on costs of performing the one and off shore sampling, analysis of samples and data obtained, documentation and forms required, and in maintaining the database of results.  In addition, since the City of San Diego has on staff trained technical personnel capable of interpreting monitoring data and laboratory results, the federal government will benefit by having access to these personnel and not having to hire occasional consultants for the interpretation of the International Wastewater Treatment Plant data.  In recognition of the co-ownership of the land and ocean outfall facilities, and the substantial savings to both the City of San Diego and the federal government for sharing of the Sampling, Monitoring, and Reporting Programs; it is in the public interest for the USIBWC and the City of San Diego to enter into a contract for the receiving water sampling, monitoring, analysis and reporting service for the IWTP.  The resultant contract will be for a basic period commencing October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007, with four one-year option periods.  The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only once source.  There is no solicitation document available.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, any and all proposals received by 10:00 a.m. local time on July 28, 2006 will be considered by the Government.  Assertion of capability to provide the required service must be submitted in writing to Colleen Elliott, USIBWC, Acquisitions Division, 4171 N Mesa, Suite C100, El Paso, TX  79902.  Information submitted must clearly demonstrate company capabilities to provide the required service.  No further synopsis will be published.

This training allows qualified personnel to demonstrate, maintain and qualify on primary and secondary crew-served weapons, while performing basic movement while engaging targets, transitioning from primary to secondary weapon, and live-fire exercises in a controlled environment.  The two class convenings are for five (5) weeks each, with one beginning April 23, 2007 and the second beginning June 11, 2007.

Requirements - The contractor shall maintain a minimum of 100 and a maximum of 150 animals at his/her facility, which must be located in the states of either Wyoming or Nebraska and within a 150 mile radius of Cheyenne, Wyoming; Up to 10 of these animals may be burros (jacks or jennies); All horses will be mares or geldings between the ages of six (6) months old and five (5) years old, unless both parties agree (on a case by case basis) to accept a mare or gelding over the age of five (5); No more than one-third (1/3) of the horses held at the facility, at any one time, will be under the age of two (2) years; BLM will minimize as much as possible the number of pregnant mares sent to the contractor; The contractor will inspect the animals when first delivered; He/she will then advise the BLM COR or PI of any animals that have physical defects that may make the animal unadoptable; The BLM COR or PI will then determine, with a veterinarian's recommendation when necessary, if the animal should be placed at another holding facility where training is not available; The contractor shall gather all animals on pasture at BLM's request; A one-week notice shall be given for gathering; The contractor will be paid for each animal that is maintained at his/her facility on a daily basis (feed day) until adopted.  A feed day is assessed for each horse at the facility at 5 p.m. of each calendar day; The contractor shall provide for adoption as many of the animals maintained at his/her facility as possible each year.  The contractor may gentle or train the animals to any level necessary to get them adopted and may adopt untrained animals.  All potential adoptions at the contractor's facility will be by scheduled appointment.   Any qualified adopters that select animals at the contractor's facility will have to provide applications, signed PMACA's, and payment to the Wyoming State Office.  Animals adopted at BLM satellite adoptions will be adopted in the same manner as untrained animals offered there. The contractor may conduct training clinics at his/her facility for qualified adopters; The contractor will be paid for each animal that is adopted while in the contractor's care or adopted at a BLM adoption where the contractor was requested by the BLM to provide animals.  Payment will include a base adoption fee based on the horse's age as well as a potential training premium for halter- and saddle-trained horses that are over the age of two (2) years of age.  Generally, halter training will be the minimum amount of training acceptable for horses offered at BLM satellite adoptions.   The BLM may request a higher level of training for certain adoptions at its discretion.  The definition of a halter trained horse is one, in a normal and routine manner and with little or no resistance, that can be safely caught, haltered and led, stands tied, accepts touching and brushing of all parts of the body, allows feet to be lifted and handled, and can be led to a stock trailer and walked into the trailer.  A saddle trained horse will meet the criteria for a halter trained horse plus accepts a saddle and rider, and will routinely perform basic maneuvers with little difficulty.  These basic maneuvers include turning in either direction, backing, and knowing the cues for walk, trot, and lope.  The horse must be capable of these maneuvers in a large arena as well as a round pen; The contractor will be requested to transport animals to adoption sites specified by the Government and demonstrate the amount of training each animal has received.  If specifically requested by the BLM COR or PI, the contractor may transport adopted animals up to 300 miles from the contractor's facility to another BLM adoption facility or to an adopter's facility; The contractor may be requested to pick up and transport previously adopted animals that have been relinquished or repossessed by the BLM.  If specifically requested by the BLM COR or PI, the contractor may transport these animals up to 300 miles from the contractor's facility to another BLM adoption facility or back to the contractor's facility; As the number of animals at the contractor's facility decline, the COR and/or PI will make arrangements for BLM to bring replacement animals, delivered by either semi-truck or horse trailer.  Delivery by horse trailer will depend on the availability of animals within a one day driving radius.  This is not intended to be a complete list of the specifications. The full requirement will be posted in solicitation NAR070068, which will be available at http://www.fbo.gov on or about April 23, 2007. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Facsimile proposals will not be accepted. Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NAICS code 541620:   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Kyle Streeland at Emory University. Negotiations shall be conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), which allows for negotiations without full and open competition if there is only one responsible source PART II - SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION Dr. Kyle Steenland, Professor of Environmental and Occupational Health at Emory University, is recommended to conduct the work described in this purchase order.   Dr. Steenland  has unique qualifications to provide assistance to the Agency in the evaluation of the carcinogenicity of ethylene oxide.  He has devoted a significant part of his career to the study and evaluation of the effects of ethylene oxide on humans and has published extensively on the epidemiology of  ethylene oxide related effects and methodology for analyzing data that relate to these effects.  He is the principal investigator of the study that is the major source of information on mortality in a cohort of people exposed to ethylene oxide [Steenland et al, "Mortality analyses in a cohort of  18, 235 ethylene oxide exposed workers: follow up extended from 1987 to 1998", Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2004), 61:2-7.]  The Agency relied heavily on the work of Dr. Steenland and his colleagues in preparing the draft Ethylene Oxide Carcinogenicity Assessment (2006).  Dr. Steenland  has also published other papers on ethylene oxide epidemiology and papers that deal with general methodology for analyzing epidemiology data that are directly relevant to the evaluation of ethylene oxide.  EPA is seeking further analysis and modeling of the data from the ethylene oxide  epidemiological studies conducted by Steenland.  Dr. Steenland is in possession of these data and computer routines developed to analyze these data for the prior publications.  Dr Steenland is thus uniquely placed having both the specialized expertise and the specific data and computer routines  required to perform this work assignment. Dr. Steenland is editor for the American Journal of Industrial Medicine and Epidemiology, a member of the American College of Epidemiology and the International Congress on Occupational Health and an editor of 2 books on occupational and environmental  epidemiology.

Background The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) has requested that the EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB) review  its draft assessment entitled "Evaluation of the Carcinogenicity of Ethylene Oxide". Ethylene oxide (EtO) is manufactured from ethylene and used primarily as a chemical intermediate in the manufacture of ethylene glycol. It is also used as a sterilizing agent for medical equipment and as a  fumigating agent for spices. The focus of the ORD draft assessment is on lifetime cancer risk from inhalation exposure.  The SAB Ethylene Oxide Panel met in Washington, DC on January 18-19, 2007 to discuss their review of the draft document and develop a plan of action for writing a panel report  documenting the Panel's review.  EPA will evaluate the Panel's report, respond to comments from the Panel and issue a revised document that takes into consideration the comments and recommendations from the panel.  EPA will also evaluate and respond to comments from the public on the draft  assessment. II. Scope of Work The contractor shall perform a number of tasks to support the Agency's evaluation and response to comments on the draft assessment from the SAB panel and the public.  The contractor will use his unique, in-depth knowledge of the epidemiological data dealing with  effects of ethylene oxide exposure on humans and risk assessment methodology in the performance of these tasks. This contract involves the analysis of secondary data.  Secondary data are defined in this context as environmental or health data that exist and are available for analysis. That is,  epidemiological data on the carcinogenic effects of exposure to ethylene oxide that were collected prior to the issuance of this contract. This includes data from the NIOSH study of workers exposed to ethylene oxide and may include other relevant data from published literature, from hard copies and  computer data bases.  Task1:  Perform a preliminary evaluation of comments from public commentators on the draft document that address epidemiological issues, carcinogenic risk estimation and related topics.  Submit a brief written summary (a minimum of three typewritten pages) of this preliminary  evaluation. Task 2: Perform a preliminary evaluation of the epidemiology and risk assessment sections of the draft document titled "Evaluation of the Carcinogenicity of Ethylene Oxide".  Submit a brief written summary (a minimum of three typewritten pages) of this preliminary evaluation. Task 3:  Identify and perform analyses to further investigate the data on ethylene oxide exposed workers analyzed in the work described in: Steenland K, Stayner L, Deddens J,  Mortality analyses in a cohort of 18 235 ethylene oxide exposed workers: follow up extended from 1987 to 1998 Occup Environ Med 61:  2-7, 2004, and Steenland K, Whelan E, Deddens J, Stayner L, Ward E, Ethylene oxide and breast cancer incidence in a cohort study of 7576 women, Cancer Causes Control 14: 531-539, 2003.  In particular, further investigation should include evaluation of the use of Poisson regression with various  dose-response models as appropriate, e.g., K-power, and segmented linear regression to model the relationship between haematopoetic cancer (and possible subcategories, e.g., lymphoid) and exposure and between breast cancer mortality and incidence and exposure. Also, evaluate the possible use of  alternative cut-points for exposure categorization. In addition, identify alternative statistical methods for relating ethylene oxide exposure and cancer effects that employ individual worker data rather than summary or categorical data.  Also, evaluate whether the available data will support  analysis of: (1) healthy worker survivor effects and (2) an assessment of the effects of uncertainty in exposure estimates. Document analyses performed.  The contractor shall provide a detailed descriptive summary of the exposure data for the cohort.  A goal of this effort is to assist EPA in  making judgments for the EtO assessment regarding the best approach to dose-response modeling of the EtO data set in order to estimate points of departure (PODs) and the associated uncertainties.  Additionally, this work should support consideration of alternative statistical 0approaches to this  problem that may warrant presentation in EPA's EtO risk assessment.  Where appropriate, per EPA technical guidance, the contractor may perform analyses of available results from other EtO epidemiological studies to provide comparison with these results. Task 4: Review all comments received from  the American Chemical Council (ACC) on the draft document titled "Evaluation of the Carcinogenicity of Ethylene Oxide" that pertain to epidemiological and related statistical issues.  Provide a draft written summary evaluation of all comments reviewed.  The summary shall include a response to each  significant comment that indicates where commentators have valid issues and where they do not; the technical basis for this finding; and recommendations on what further analyses, if any, should be done to support the response to the comment.   Task 5: Review all comments received from the EPA  Science Advisory Board Panel on the draft document titled "Evaluation of the Carcinogenicity of Ethylene Oxide" that pertain to epidemiological and related statistical issues. Provide a draft written summary evaluation of the Panel's comments.  The summary shall include an assessment of each  significant comment and a suggested response. The summary shall indicate the technical basis for the contractor's findings and recommend what further analyses, if any, should be performed to support the contractor's positions. Task 6: In consultation with the Technical Project Officer, determine  what, if any, additional analyses should be performed to provide technical support for comment responses to the ACC and /or the Science Advisory Board Panel. Task 7: Perform and document analyses identified in Task 6.   III. Deliverables and Professional Services All products by the Contractor  must be of high quality, written in a clear concise style, with a logical organization and presentation. Descriptions of analyses performed must: 1.	Identify and summarize data employed; 2.	Clearly specify models, methodology and assumptions underlying the analyses; 3.

<DESC>The Agricultural Health Study (AHS) is one of the hallmark efforts currently underway on agricultural health in the United States. The study was initiated in 1993 by 3 lead organizations including: The National Cancer Institute (NCI), The National Institute of Environmental Health Scientists (NIEHS), and The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The study uses a longitudinal cohort design and evaluates how lifestyle habits, genetic factors, and agricultural exposures at work and in the environment contribute to the risk of disease. Over 89,000 certified farmer pesticide applicators and their spouses, from North Carolina and Iowa, and licensed commercial pesticide applicators, from Iowa, are included in the study, making it one of the largest agricultural health studies ever conducted in the United States. The AHS is now in the third round. Initial study efforts focused on pesticide exposures in the etiology of various cancers; however, more recent efforts have begun to address other health outcomes including kidney disease, nervous system disorders, reproductive effects, and respiratory disease. This large cohort provides a unique opportunity for the study of respiratory health outcomes in agriculture including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and chronic bronchitis, with the study of both prevalent and incident disease patterns as well as risk factors related to pesticide and non-pesticide exposures. 

This procurement is for the Agricultural Health Study, which is a longitudinal cohort study of agricultural workers in the states of NC and Iowa, and two contractors have been awarded competitively to complete the third round of the questionnaire surveys by the NCI, EPA, and NIEHS. Only these approved NCI / EPA / NIEHS contractors would have access to the databases / study participant rosters to complete these interviews, including the respiratory health questionnaire components. Additionally, these contractors have experience with this large cohort and have demonstrated competency during previous surveys.

This work will be done at the University of Iowa Field Station and will support collaborative efforts between NIOSH and the NCI / NIEHS.

This notice is being posted for information purposes only.  All information received will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>Description:   Design, Development, Integration, Testing, Implementation, Deployment, Training, and Maintenance of the Next Generation Identification (NGI).

Request for Comments (RFC):

This is Part I of a two part RFC.  Part I consists of the following documents posted on FedTeds:  Instructions for Responding to the RFC, and a draft Request for Proposal (Sections B through M).  Part II (to be released on FedTeds on 3/7/2007) will contain the NGI IAFIS System Requirements Document.
This is an RFC, not a Request for Proposal/Request for Quotation (RFP/RFQ).  This information is being sought for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the FBI.  No solicitation exists; therefore, please do not request a copy of a solicitation.  If in the future a solicitation is released, there is no guarantee that sources responding to this RFC will be included on the source list.  This RFC is intended to gain information from integrators, developers, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) and other biometric search solution providers, test organizations, etc. to aid the FBI in providing clarity to a future solicitation, if one is released.
Purpose:

The FBI is releasing this RFC in order to:
1.	Inform industry (potential Offerors) about the FBI?s plans for acquisition and sustainment of the Next Generation Identification (NGI) system.
2.	Solicit recommendations from industry regarding how to best achieve the Bureau?s vision for the NGI.
3.	Solicit recommendations from industry for improving the draft RFP and the specifications in order to
?	Encourage competition,
?	Reduce program risk,
?	Reduce acquisition cost,
?	Reduce the total cost of ownership (Life Cycle Cost), 
?	Achieve higher levels of performance of the NGI.

Security Requirements:

The Government intends to secure services or equipment from firms where, in the opinion of the Government, foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI) does not adversely impact security requirements.  The Government reserves the right to contract with such Interested Parties under appropriate arrangements when it determines that such a contract will be in the best interest of the Government.  With the understanding that this RFC may result in a future RFP, Offerors are encouraged to voluntarily submit information requested on the Key Management Personnel List (KMPL) and the Section K ? Acquisition Risk Questions attached with this RFC in order to expedite the risk assessment requirement, which will be part of the RFP.  If an interested party submitted this information as part of the NGI RFI released in October 2006, the information does not need to be resubmitted as part of the RFC response unless the information has changed.


Reference Library:

Reference documentation will be provided on the internet at https://www.fedteds.gov (FEDTEDS) and at the FBI?s CJIS Division Visitor Center.  The documents available to date include those posted with the RFI on October 26, 2006, as well as those posted on January 31, 2007, February 9, 2007, February 16, 2007, and with this RFC.

Other organizations who feel are capable of meeting IMLS' requirements are hereby given notice of an opportunity to respond and are invited to submit information establishing a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement.  If IMLS does not identify other acceptable sources capable of providing this requirement, the agency shall issue a sole source award for the above service under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Emergency Management Institute (EMI), National Emergency Training Center (NETC) has an Emergency Management Higher Education Project, which seeks to develop a stand-alone, 3 credit hour 45 contact hour, semester length, classroom-based, upper division undergraduate/graduate-level college course on Catastrophe Readiness and Response.  This requirement will be set aside 100% to small business.  The NAICS code is 611430, Professional and Management Development Training, and the small business size standard is $6.5 million [average annual revenue for three preceding fiscal years].  Award of a firm-fixed-price purchase order, using simplified acquisition procedures is anticipated.  The award will be made based on Best Value to the Government, in accordance with the evaluation factors set forth herein and in the Request for Quotation (RFQ) package.  Potential offerors must request the Request for Quotation (RFQ) package in writing, no later than July 14, 2006, by sending their request to ATTN: Teresa Dingle, Contract Specialist, via email to teresa.dingle@dhs.gov.  RFQ packages will be sent to potential offerors via email only; therefore, offerors shall include a point of contact name and email address with their request for the RFQ package.  The goal of this requirement is to encourage and support the expansion of hazard, disaster and emergency management related education in colleges and universities across the United States so that in the future more emergency management and related personnel in government and the private sector will come to the job not only with a college education, but with a course of study, if not a degree, in emergency management as well.  Because emergency management is a multidisciplinary field of study, this helps contribute to the professionalization of emergency management and the expansion of emergency management knowledge and principles into other professions and disciplines as well-all of which contributes to building disaster resistant and resilient communities of tomorrow.  Toward that end, EMI, located at the NETC in Emmitsburg, Maryland, developed the Higher Education Project, the primary purpose of which is to encourage and support the development of hazard, disaster and emergency management bachelor and graduate degree programs within the United States colleges and universities.  Each Emergency Management Higher Education Project course shall be developed within the philosophical context of (1) building disaster resistant and resilient communities, and (2) seeking balance between the technocratic and the social vulnerability reduction approaches to emergency management.  Please refer to the Higher Education Project Slide Presentation at the following website address:  http://training.fema.gov/EMIweb/edu/highedbrief_course2.ppt.  A listing of the completed Emergency Management Higher Education Project courses can be found at the following website: http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/edu/highedbief_course2ppt.  Additional information concerning the Emergency Management Higher Education Project can be accessed at:  http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/edu/aem_courses.htm.
Course developers shall be able to provide evidence of holding a doctoral degree from an accredited college or university, demonstrate experience teaching hazard, disaster and/or emergency management related courses at the upper division or graduate college level at an accredited university within the past five (5) years (provide course titles, dates and copies of most relevant course syllabi), demonstrate knowledge of and background in the subject matter of “comprehensive emergency management,” demonstrate familiarity with emergency management-related literature, demonstrate background, credentials and expertise in the subject matter of catastrophe readiness and response-preferable demonstrated by the provision of a copy of a college course syllabus for an emergency management course taught by the offeror, or, by one of the proposed course development team members that relates to catastrophe readiness and response, or catastrophe-related publications, demonstrate experience with inter-disciplinary development team, and demonstrate experience of inter-collegiate development team representing more than a single college.  Catastrophes are different from disasters in kind, and not just in degree, and thinking about Katrina-like catastrophes requires a different kind of thinking, planning, and preparing than that for disasters.  After a few hundred years of disaster experience in the United States, there is still a lack of consensus on the core factors or conditions for successful catastrophe preparedness and response.  Dozens of events have each taken many hundreds of lives-accidents, earthquakes, explosions, fires, floods, hurricanes, pandemics, terrorism, and wildfires.  Hundreds more have cost lives and economic loss.  The United States is becoming more vulnerable to disasters and catastrophes, which are guaranteed to be part of our future; therefore, there needs to be more consensus.  Amongst the topics that could conceivably be covered in a college course on Catastrophe Readiness and Response are:  Definitions and Discussion of Disaster and Catastrophe; Distinctions to be made between disaster readiness and response as compared with catastrophe readiness and response; Acceptance of Catastrophe Potential as a Precondition to Serious Planning for Catastrophe; Acting on Risk Determinations-Catastrophe Worse Case Scenarios versus Unrealistic Fear and Unlikely Scenarios; Case Studies of Catastrophes-Here and Abroad; Importance of Highly Trained and Professional Emergency Management Cadre in Adequate Number; Importance of State-Level Funding Mechanisms to Develop Staff and Capabilities-Florida Example; All-Hazards versus Terrorism-Specific Approaches to Catastrophe Readiness: Boils down to which is the truer statement: The better prepared a community is for the full range of potential hazards facing a community (all hazards), the better the community will be for a terrorist event, OR, The better prepared a community is for a Weapons of Mass Destruction terrorist attack (terrorism-specific focus and dual-use funding philosophy), the better prepared the community will be for all other hazards; which is the highest priority Prevention, Reduction and Mitigation Measures or, Readiness, Preparedness and Response Measures; Horizontal and Vertical Integration-Creating a Culture of Catastrophe Readiness in a Jurisdiction or Organization; Applicability of Social Vulnerability Approach to Emergency Management Concept to Catastrophe Readiness and Response; Coordination and Cooperation versus Command and Control Modules; Risk Assessment and Risk Management-How best should scarce resources be devoted, tradeoffs between preparing for most likely versus most costly; The Emergency Management Assistance Compact-Structure, Operations, Capabilities; Regional Approaches to Readiness Capability Building as Essential; Military (Active Duty and National Guard) Roles in Catastrophe Readiness and Response-Military Support to Civil Authority; Communications Systems; Catastrophe Planning versus Disaster Planning; Catastrophe Operations and Resource Management; Leadership in Disasters/Catastrophes-Developing Leadership in Students; and Improvisation, Flexibility, Resourcefulness and Decentralized Decision Making.  The Contractor will be required to develop a work plan for this development effort, attend and participate in a course development/focus group meeting, develop a course outline/syllabus, develop draft course materials, attend a draft course review comments meeting at EMI/NETC in Emmitsburg, Maryland, develop final course materials, and attend and conduct a presentation at the Annual Higher Education Project Summer Conference at EMI/NETC, Emmitsburg, Maryland.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Department owns perpetual software licenses for the current baseline products – however, to support more users, additional licenses and support is needed.   Microstrategy software is the basis for measuring the performance of ILMS.  The software and support services needed to accomplish this task in ILMS include: MicroStrategy WebReporter, MicroStrategy Office,  MicroStrategy Web Professional,  MicroStrategy Intelligence Server,  MicroStrategy Report Services,  MicroStrategy OLAP Services,  MicroStrategy SDK, and MicroStrategy Bronze Technical Support A full description of the software and support services that are required can be found on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule for MicroStrategy.<BR><BR>Due to the proprietary nature of the MicroStrategy software, the required software and support is available only from MicroStrategy.  The software and support described in paragraph 3 is crucial for measuring the performance of ILMS.   ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system.  ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000.  ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System.  In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc.  ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the MicroStrategy software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support.  Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure software and support from MicroStrategy would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the ability to measure the performance of ILMS.<BR><BR>

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

AFRL/Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies and experiments to increase the lab's knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required in support of automated COMINT collection and processing.  Solutions to basic research and engineering problems using innovative approaches are sought.  The overall technical objectives of the BAA are to develop techniques and algorithms for the detection, recognition, exploitation, and location of analog and digital communication signals in a moderate to dense co-channel environment. We are interested in techniques and algorithms for: (1) Automated detection, identification, characterization, and geolocation; (2) Enhanced collection system efficiency; and (3) Improved digital signal processing hardware and software. The scope of this effort concerns several areas and covers a broad range of issues, which include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Signal detection (2) Signal recognition and classification in low Signal to Interference Noise Ratio (SINR) environments (3) Improved methods to accomplish geolocation (4) Multi-User Detection (MUD) algorithms (5) Interference cancellation (6) TDOA/FDOA techniques (7) Emerging technologies and radio communication devices (8) Wireless communications (RF and Networked) (9) Miniaturization of systems to allow embedding aboard UAV platforms.  Detailed scope and definition of problems follow here: (1) Automated detection, identification, characterization, geolocation in moderate to low SINR environments: Current SIGINT platforms are inundated with multiple signals of interest across the spectrum, but are not able to process all of the high priority signals for a host of reasons including dense signal environments, low power signals, low SINR, power control, etc. (2) Any technologies that will enable current systems greater ability to automatically detect, identify, sort, track, prioritize and reliably classify and locate signals would apply. Specific emitter identification techniques are desired. (3) Improved Geolocation:  Technology to further enable SIGINT platforms to geolocate threat RF emitters using any method is another area of research covered by this BAA.  Particular attention will be paid to technology that will enable precise geolocation (weapon system accuracies) of emitters beneath interference.  (4) Multi-User Detection: Efficient Multi-User Detection algorithms for modern existing and emerging Personal Communication Systems (PCS) are desired.  Specialized processing techniques and specialized hardware designs/implementations to accelerate MUD algorithms are also desired. (5) Interference cancellation: Techniques for beamformed, digital and temporal interference cancellation techniques that work on a single and/or array antenna are desired. (6) TDOA/FDOA techniques for improved geolocation for moderate to dense signal environments and that are software portable is desired. (7) Emerging technologies and radio communication devices: We are interested in developing the above capabilities for existing and emerging military and commercial radio communications. (8) Wireless communications (RF and Networked): We are interested in techniques for second, third and emerging wireless standards, as well as the network layer protocols that augment the RF capabilities. (9) System miniaturization: Given current levels of activity, operational requirements, hostile environments, and resources being heavily tasked, collection systems will need to be developed for embedding on UAV-type platforms.  Attention to DSP requirements, tradeoff with capability assessments, power requirements and payload weight are necessarily essential areas of concern, hence digital receiving and processing systems employing miniaturization techniques are of high interest.  (10) Modify and augment existing fielded SIGINT systems, and aid in the development of research capabilities that can be inserted into open architecture systems. Use simulation and modeling to analyze and assess technical performance of signal processing algorithms and techniques.  (11)  Support assessment, selection, and refinement of algorithms by evaluating different classes of algorithms and specific algorithm designs.   The contractor will work with Government organizations and other contractors to identify and acquire algorithms of interest, and provide technical, implementation and benefit assessments.  (12)  Participate in system planning activities for airborne SIGINT systems, including assessment of operational requirements, mission and threat analysis, threat signal characterization, and analysis of system operations.  (13)  Provide planning information to help anticipate new threat systems and enabling technologies and techniques; perform systems engineering of advanced SIGINT concepts and systems; develop and transition key algorithms and processing techniques; assist in collection, processing, and interpretation of test data; and evaluate alternative approaches and algorithms to assess their advantages and deficiencies.  (14)  Monitor developments that influence the character and priority of different potential SIGINT targets, trends in architecture and operations of SIGINT systems, and algorithms and implementation technologies for SIGINT processing.  Based on this information, the contractor will provide inputs to AFRL/IFEC to shape ongoing activities that best accommodate projected threat characteristics, develop capabilities that integrate with other SIGINT and sensor systems, and apply relevant and useful techniques and technologies in SIGINT processing.  Coordinate with organizations, users, platforms, and developers throughout the SIGINT community.  (15)  Assist in the development of capabilities that can be integrated with SIGINT and sensor systems. (16)  Work with AFRL/IFEC in planning, equipping, conducting, interpreting, and achieving field collections of relevant data.  Ensure that field collections obtain technically valid and operationally relevant data, in characterizing the collected data, and in documenting and formatting the data to support its use across the SIGINT community.  (17)  Participate in field testing and flight testing in order to accomplish data collection.   (18)  Be responsible for the development of the AFRL Blue Mountain collection and analysis in-house system. Support AFRL in-house research through data collections, integration and test of AFRL developed algorithms and techniques, development planning, acquisition support, and specialty engineering.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in equal order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:  (1) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation  (2) The potential contributions of the effort to the Rome Research Site mission and the extent to which the proposed effort will contribute to balancing the overall research and development program of AFRL (3)  Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; as well as the qualification, capabilities and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives and the offeror's record of past and present performance. (4) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (5) the reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation.   

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.

Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.

A.	Cultural Resource Assessment

GSA projects may require all or parts of a Cultural Resource Assessment to be conducted for Federal actions to ensure compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and pursuant regulations (36 CFR Part 800).  The Contractor shall identify and evaluate historic properties [see 36CFR Part 800.4] on and adjacent to the project area in consultation with GSA and the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO).  The Contractor shall prepare ?Requests for Determinations of Eligibility? (DOE), a history and archaeology report, and an assessment of effects for historic properties identified which are listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).  The survey area or area of potential effect (APE) for historic properties may include prehistoric and historic districts, sites, buildings, structures, or objects which are adjacent to, abut, or located within the project area.
	
  a.  Study Components
i.	Identification and Evaluation
1.	Historic Resources
Background research.   City, County and State surveys for historic resources shall be consulted in order to locate previously identified resources within the project APE.  Survey forms for any previously identified resources within the APE shall be copied and location of the resources located on the appropriate USGS topographic map.  Files of existing and proposed National Register properties shall be consulted in the City, County or SHPO offices.  A copy of each National Register Nomination Form and National Register Summary Form shall be copied for each listed and proposed National Register property located within the APE.
Field Survey.  A field survey shall be conducted in order to identify and locate all listed and eligible National Register properties (including those within historic districts or multiple resource areas).  State Survey Guidelines shall be followed.
Survey Form.  Appropriate State Survey Forms shall be completed for each previously unevaluated historic resource located within the APE which are 50 years or older.  State Survey Manual guidelines shall be used as the reference document for completing these forms.
Requests for Determinations of Eligibility.  In addition to the survey form, requests for Determinations of Eligibility (DOE) shall be prepared by performing all necessary primary and secondary source research.  DOE documentation shall include appropriate Historic Property Information Forms (HPIF) for each previously unevaluated historic resource.  Unless otherwise specified, the information shall include current 35mm color or black and white photographs of the existing historic resources and condition thereof, copies of historic photographs if available, and a sketch of the existing and original floor plans.  Current exterior and interior photographs of the existing historic resource(s) shall be numbered, labeled, and keyed to a sketch of the existing floor plan.  In addition, date of construction of the original building(s) and any additions which were added shall be noted.  Additions to historic resources shall be clearly marked on a location map showing the original building footprint.  State property information forms shall be used as the reference document for gathering the information.
National Register Evaluation.  Apply the National Register Criteria (36 CFR, Part 63) to each existing historic resource on and facing the site that is not already listed in the NRHP.  Provide GSA with recommendations as to the eligibility or ineligibility of each resource for inclusion in the NRHP individually and/or as part of a historic district, including a justification for recommendation.
For any historic resource recommended as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and for those already included in the NRHP, the Contractor shall identify those elements or characteristics of the resource that do and do not contribute to its eligibility, including a justification for each recommendation.
2.	Archaeological Resources
Conduct a Phase I archaeological survey of the project site, and provide GSA with recommendations concerning the probability that archaeological resources eligible for inclusion in the NRHP exist on the site.  An extensive background literature review shall be conducted to document previously identified archaeological sites and to delineate areas of high site potential within and adjacent to the project area, to develop prehistoric and historic contexts for the survey corridor.  Background research shall include review of relevant documents housed with the SHPO, Office of the State Archaeologist, State Site Files, State Department of Archives and History, and the Surveyor General?s Collections.  The States? preservation plan shall also be consulted.  The study must address the following:	
?	Is it likely that significant historic or prehistoric archaeological sites, if they exist, are preserved there in whole or in part?
?	What significance (research or other) would any such site have?
?	If there is significance, would such a site be eligible for inclusion on the NRHP?
?	Is Phase II archaeological study or site testing needed to clarify the presence/absence and/or significance of archaeological resources on the project site, and if so, why?
?	Provide scope of work for any recommended site testing or Phase II evaluation.
?	If archaeological monitoring is recommended for affected sites, these activities may be required as part of this project phase. 
b.	 Effect Determination
  1.     Historic Resources

The contractor shall determine the likely effects of the undertaking on all identified listed or eligible National Register historic resources.  The contractor shall provide GSA with a determination of effect for each historic resource (no historic properties affected, no adverse effect, or adverse effect).  The determination of effect documentation shall include a discussion of direct and indirect effects to the historic resources, a justification for the determination, alternatives to avoid adverse effects, plans to minimize harm and proposed mitigation, if applicable.

2.   Archaeological Resources

The Contractor shall provide GSA with a determination of effect for each National Register eligible archaeological resource which is likely to exist on the project site.  The determination of effect documentation shall include a discussion of direct and indirect effects to the historic resource, a justification for the determination, alternatives to avoid adverse effects, plans to minimize harm, and proposed mitigation, if applicable.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  REVISED The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport proposes to establish an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract through the Small Business Administration’s “8(a)” program to provide administrative support to various organizational elements at the Newport RI facility.  This five year, cost plus fixed fee contract will incorporate performance-based service contracting features.  Labor categories will include secretary, word processor, general clerk and a program manager.  The total level of effort will be approximately 382,400 manhours.  All effort will be in Government-provided office space, except for the program manager.  The Government will provide all equipment and materials.  There will be no travel.  Selection will be best-value based on management approach, past performance, personnel, other socio-economic factors and realistic cost.   This is a follow-on effort to contract N66604-02-D-2281 with Future Technologies Incorporated of Fairfax, VA, which is no longer 8(a) eligible. Much of the work requires security clearances, up to SECRET.  Per FAR 5.205(f), competition is limited to eligible 8(a) concerns.    Interested 8(a) firms should request (download) a copy of the solicitation as expeditiously as possible since the solicitation will be issued without further notice upon SBA acceptance of the requirement for the section 8(a) program. At the request of FTI, contact information will not be provided directly to their employees.  Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.  Instead, they may be accessed at our web site http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.  We also provide electronic access in our Bid Room.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to respond to additional questions received from potential offerors.  The response date for submittal of the SF330s is extended to May 1, 2007.  No additional questions will be addressed at this time. Q1.  Is it possible to get a list of bidders to this solicitation? A1.  No, a list of bidders is not available. Q2.  Are we permitted to alter the SF330 forms (i.e., can empty field be removed from Section E, 19 Relevant Projects; Section F, 25, Firms from Section C Involved with This Project? A2.  No, altering the SF330 is not permitted. Q3. Your response to Question 10 stated "Past Performance will be limited to the prime contractor", please clarify.  Are projects in Section F to be only those of the prime? A3.  Question 10 of modification 2 is revised as follows:  Past performance references should be submitted for all members of the proposed team identified in Part I, Section C., of the SF330.  Therefore, Section F may include projects which best illustrate the proposed team?s qualifications for all members.   Q4.  Is there an incumbent performing this work? A4.  No, there is not an incumbent performing this work. (See the answer to question 1 of modification 2. Q5.  Is there a projected timeframe for issuing the RFP? A5.  The RFP is expected to be issued to the selected firm at a date to be determined. Q6.  Will there be a pre-solicitation conference? A6.  No, there will not be a pre-solicitation conference. (See the answer to question 19 of modification 2. Q7.  Will the Government post interested companies for partnering? A7.  No, the Government will not post interested companies for partnering. Q8.   In reference to questions and answers on Modification 02,  does the answer to question 10 mean that Section F of the SF 330 is limited to projects performed by the prime and cannot include projects performed by team members other than the prime? This would seem to discriminate against teams that chose not to propose as a joint venture and also is contrary to the general instructions for the SF 330. A8.  See the answer to question 3 of this modification. Q9.  In reference to the questions and answers on Modification 02, the answer to question 2 appears to conflict with the answer to question 10.  How will the team subcontractors contribution be evaluated if their experience cannot be included in Section F? A9.  See the answer to question 3 of this modification.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Best Value -Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).   Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation.   

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will be reviewing the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding their use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the area of Intelligence and analytic support systems.   

The Intelligence Community and the Air Force routinely sponsor classified and unclassified research to advance the state of the art in intelligence and analytic support systems. To date, many of these programs have focused on developing systems, tools and algorithms to detect international terrorist activities and planned events of interest.  By relying on highly accurate and analyst-vetted knowledge about known terrorists, groups, affiliations, and activities these tools and methods have proven to be very effective at tracking terrorist suspects and detecting their threat event intentions.  In total, these programs have resulted in the development and evaluation of several methods of detecting and searching for patterns of terrorist behaviors, representing these behaviors in human and machine interpretable form and efficiently searching large data stores for evidence of known behaviors.  Significant effort has been invested in improving the performance and scalability of the most promising algorithms, often resulting in two orders of magnitude increase in scalability and four orders of magnitude speed-up in compute time.  However, the total production time for a single answer is currently measured in days and weeks.  To have any demonstrable improvement in the intelligence process we need to provide answers in hours or minutes.   Several fundamental challenges remain before the technology can be deployed broadly within the Intelligence Community.  The four key challenges that define the essence of the Tangram program are:

  Reduce system and data configuration time of all automated entity and threat discovery processes by two orders of magnitude (100 x).

  Reduce threat entity and event discovery time by two orders of magnitude (100 x).

  Increase overall efficiency by three orders of magnitude and overall productivity by two orders of magnitude over current processes while delivering a consistently high intelligence value as determined by experienced analysts.

  Improve the detection of low observable threats and events where guilt by association assumptions may not apply. 

The fundamental technologies developed under previous programs have been evaluated through peer review and technical evaluations. There is no debate that these technologies are capable of filling an important void in the Intelligence Community's analytic arsenal. However, to achieve their potential, we must develop the processes, procedures and standards to deploy a fully automated, analytic system capable of processing tens of thousands of simultaneous analytic inquiries in an efficient and scalable manner. To achieve this, the data, algorithms, and computing resources must be flexible and adaptable.  Essentially, the system must be self composing because of the variety and unpredictability of the questions to be answered.

Tangram is unique in that it takes a systematic view of the process; applying what is now a set of disjointed technologies that are difficult for non-technical users to apply, cumbersome to configure into a self?configuring, continuously operating system.

Tangram is envisioned as a fully automated, continuously operating, intelligence analysis support system that's capable of configuring itself to achieve a reasonable tradeoff between estimated intelligence value and cost, where:

  Analysis Support means the production of hypotheses representing an adversary's intentions, methods, logistics support or intended targets based on: 1) behavioral patterns, relationships or context that are expressed only in data and, 2) analyst feedback about prior hypotheses.

  Configuring itself means the system is aware of the data characteristics, algorithm capabilities and requirements, and hardware resources such that it can reason how best to produce an answer.

  Reasonable means good is enough, optimal is not required.

  Intelligence Value is a subjective score or estimate of the intelligence utility of a hypotheses produced by the system.

  Cost is the effort required to produce an answer and the opportunity cost of not producing a higher intelligence value product using the same system resources.

This BAA seeks research efforts that advance the state-of-the-art in the following areas: 1) System Research, 2) Component Research, and 3) Gap Filling Research, and 4) System Evaluation Architecture (SEA).  Additional details regarding these areas are detailed in the TANGRAM Proposer's Information Packet (PIP) and other documents which can be found at https://extranet.if.afrl.af.mil/programs/TANGRAM/TANGRAM-extra.html.  Offerors wishing to propose in more than one area should submit separate white papers and proposals.

II. AWARD INFORMATION:

Total funding for this BAA is approximately $49M.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 06 - $8M; FY 07 - $12M; FY 08 - $12M; FY 09 - $12M; and FY10 - $5M.     

Offerors should make a genuine effort to estimate their actual costs for their research efforts and not attempt to use estimates of the number of awards and total program budget to guess at a realistic cost.  When evaluating cost realism and reasonableness the Government will take this into consideration.

For the System Research area, two awards are anticipated for a period not exceeding 48 months with go/no-go decisions at 24 months.  However, the Government may consider a single System Research award to an offeror. Any exceptionally strong system prototype proposal that demonstrates a solid understanding of the problem, proposes a technical approach with well managed risks, has an exceptionally proven team and the capabilities to transition their technology into classified  environments will be considered for a single award. Each award is not expected to be less than $3M per year.  For the Component Research, awards will not normally exceed 24 months with dollar amounts ranging from $250K to $2M per year.     For the System Evaluation Architecture (SEA), a single award not to exceed 48 months with dollar amounts ranging from $500K to $1.0M per year is anticipated.  For the Gap Filling Research, awards will not normally exceed 48 months with dollar amounts ranging from $150K to $750K per year.  The government plans to restrict the SEA award winner from also being awarded a System Research or Component Research award.  

Teaming:  AFRL anticipates awards to integrated team(s) to achieve the desired technical capabilities for the System Research technical area, the Component Research areas, and the System Evaluation Architecture (SEA) area.  Individual awards are anticipated for the Gap Filling Research areas. Teams may have any organizational structure capable of performing the work.  However, when a team is structured, a specific individual and institution with overall responsibility for team performance must be identified.

Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. 

The anticipated start date for the FY 06 efforts under the solicitation is May 2006.

VI. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:  (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - Including understanding the problem,  the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology, integration approach, and appropriate levels of readiness at yearly intervals, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3)  Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Cost Realism, Reasonableness, and Project Management Plan - The overall estimated costs should be clearly justified and appropriate for the technical complexity of the effort.  Evaluation will consider the value of the research to the government and the extent to which the proposed management plan details the capabilities necessary to effectively manage the team and allocate resources to achieve the capabilities proposed.  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.     Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.     

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.       

VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.     Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white paper/proposals will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VIII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after whitepaper/proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:     

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

AFRL intends to team with one or more U.S. intelligence agencies, and may desire that proposers selected for award would perform in collaboration with those agencies.  Key Performers of prospective awardees whose activities would involve collaboration with the Intelligence Community must hold a current Top Secret Department of Defense (DoD) clearance and be approved for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.  A sufficient number of non-key performers to enable the effective accomplishment of the proposed research effort must also hold a Top Secret DoD clearance with SCI access, or be eligible for the timely granting of such clearance and access.  In addition, prospective awardees whose activities would be associated with the Intelligence Community must also possess a current DoD Top Secret Facility clearance and an approved SCI Facility (SCIF). Proposers desiring consideration for awards involving collaboration with the Intelligence Community shall identify key personnel and enabling support staff satisfying the above Top Secret DoD clearance and SCI access requirement; shall certify their DoD Top Secret Facility clearance; and, shall detail their organization's approach to maintaining separation of unclassified and classified activities, and controlling need-to-know. 

3.  REPORTING:  Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through our web-based reporting system known as JIFFY.  Prior to award the offeror will be given complete instructions regarding its use.

Here is the draft Scope of Work for this requirement:

Definitions:

Health Information Exchange (HIE) is defined as the mobilization of healthcare information electronically across organizations within a region or community.  
“Health Information Service Provider” (HSP) -  a role that can be played by different types of entities and organizations that meet criteria for the provision of core health information exchange services and abide by relevant polices and procedures

Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) is a “network of networks” that will facilitate the accurate, appropriate, timely, and secure exchange of health information that allows information to follow the consumer and supports clinical decision making.

  
Scope of Work Draft 04/09/07

The purpose of this is to establish a near real-time electronic nationwide public health situational awareness capability through an interoperable network of systems, e.g., Nationwide Health Information Network, to share data and information to enhance rapid response to, and management of, potentially catastrophic infectious disease outbreaks and other public health emergencies.  The capability is dependent on simultaneous provision of data and information to all levels of public health.  A successful HIE must standardize information storage and messaging formats, address privacy concerns, accurately identify patients, and resolve varying local, state, and federal regulations.  The factors below address this activity:

1.	Interoperability Standards
Contractors will implement the relevant HHS recognized interoperability standards accepted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in December 2006.  See the Executive Order: Promoting Quality and Efficient Health Care in Federal Government Administered or Sponsored Health Care Programs at http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/08/20060822-2.html and standards at  http://www.hhs.gov/healthit/standards.html 
 
2.	Minimum Data Set for Biosurveillance.
Contractors will implement and iteratively evaluate the Minimum Data Set (MDS) accepted by the American Health Information Community. Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.  Harmonized Use Case for Biosurveillance (Visit, Utilization and Lab Results Data).  2006 [cited 2006 Dec 1]); Available from: http://www.hhs.gov/healthit/usecases/
  
3.	NHIN Health Information Service Provider 
Contractors will ensure the core services and relevant use case capabilities are enabled by a NHIN HSP.   Core services are services, capabilities, behaviors and functions in the following areas:  
     i.	  Data Services
     ii.  Consumer Capabilities
     iii. User and Subject Identity Management
     iv.  Exchange Management Services

4.	Bi-directional Communications
Contractors will implement bi-directional communication for the dissemination and interactive exchange of information, both horizontally and vertically, between the general public, clinical care entities, public health entities, and incident command entities using a common set of communications standards to support alerting and exchange of contact information between public health and clinical care.  Contractors will build on existing rules and policies for appropriate sharing of patient and institution information that balance information protection and access or propose innovative rules. 

5.	Data Quality Management and Accessibility
Contractors will use an architecture approach to data storage that protects privacy and provides simultaneous access for local, state, and federal agencies.  This architecture will support both national anonymized record level data for routine analysis and provide authorized re-identification during emergency investigations. 

Contractors will provide data quality control and data documentation consistent with public health surveillance analytic practices and procedures to establish and maintain a near real-time electronic nationwide public health situation awareness capability.  

6.	Data Evaluation and Assessment to Detect, Characterize and Track a Public Health Threat
Contractors will develop visualization, analysis, and interpretation tools for decision support in the event of a public health threat.  These tools will be shared with federal agencies.

7.	Effectiveness, Costs, and Scalability 
Contractors will provide evidence of effectiveness, costs, and scalability of sub-network configurations for connecting healthcare and public health entities.

<SUBJECT>84--UPDATE TO USA-SNOTE-070220-004 USMC THREE-SEASON SLEEP SYSTEM
<SOLNBR>USA-SNOTE-070220-004
<RESPDATE>042707
<ARCHDATE>06262007
<CONTACT>Kevin Parker, 508-233-5937
<DESC>3/20/07 Update:  CAPITILIZE TEXT REPRESENT UPDATE TO ORIGINAL RFI BASED UPON FINDINGS IN MARINE FOCUS GROUPS REQUIREMENTS: US Marine Corps Program Manager-Infantry Combat Equipment (PM-ICE), Quantico, VA is contemplating adopting a 3 season sleeping bag system to significantly reduce weight and volume while providing environmental protection for 20 deg Fahrenheit and above.  A  3 season sleep system will be modular and consist of; sleeping mat, bivy cover, sleeping bag and simple compression stuff sack, where each component can be used singularly or in various combinations as missions environmental conditions dictate. USMC is s eeking to identify commercial or modified commercial products for one or more of the individual system components or complete system that will offer significant weight, volume, protection, AND RELIABILITY improvements over the current items by AN EXTENDED SUBMISSION DATE OF 27 APR 07. USMC prioritizes maximizing weight and volume reductions over increasing insulation beyond the minimum requirement, where applicable. MARINES STRESSED THE NEED FOR RELIABILE USE WITHOUT COMPONENT FAILIURE IN THE FIELD IS A HIG H PRIORITY.  IF PRESENTED WITH A CHOICE TO REDUCE WEIGHT OR VOLUME FURTHER BEYOND OUR OBJECTIVES, MARINES PREFERRED LOWER VOLUME AND INCREASED RELIABILITY IF WEIGHT SAVINGS IS A MATTER OF OUNCES HERE AND THERE.  A new 3 season sleep system, OR selected com ponents, will replace CORRESPONDING components of the current system, which consists of the Modular Sleep System bivy cover, GREEN patrol bag, ISO mat, and compression stuff sack.  The 3 season sleep system objectives for the 4 integrated components follow : New System Weight:  6.0 lbs max required, 5.0 lbs desired.  The current system component weights in pounds are; patrol bag @ 2.3, bivy @2.2, mat at 1.2, and compression stuff sack @ 0.8 lbs. New System Total Volume:  720 cu in required, 640 cu in desired.  MARINES EXPECT TO STOW THEIR MAT AND  PACKED BAG/BIVY/STUFF SACK SEPARATELY, WHICH BREAKS DOWN SYSTEM VOLUME TO A MAXIMUM OF  540 CU IN FOR BAG/BIVY/COMPRESSION SACK, AND 460 CU IN DESIRED C OMPARED TO 800 CU INCH FOR CURRENT PATROL BAG/BIVY.  THE current ISO mat is 780 cu in where 80 CU IN VOLUME IS DESIRED. THE MAJORITY OF MARINES PREFER A FULL LENGTH MAT.  Note volumes are calculated from cylindrical dimensions. New System Insulation:  Manikin clo values of the sleep system requires  a minimum 5.3 clo, 6.0 clo desired, while wearing silkweight thermal underwear, fleece cap, socks and glove liner (INSIDE THE SLEEPING BAG/BIVY THAT ARE A TOP THE SLEEPING MAT).  The current system component system provides a 4.3 clo with component clo ESTIMATED at: 1.5 patrol bag @, 0.4 bivy @, 0.9 mat. The Government has not established correlation with KSU manikin yet expects a 1 clo increase over KSU results on the current patrol b ag sleep system will meet this requirement. Wet Weather Protection:  The bivy cover MUST be waterproof with maximum breathability from the bivy top as a minimum.  The sleeping bag shell shall be water repellent with maximum breathability.  The mat and compression stuff sack will not absorb water whe n placed over standing puddled water, exposed to extended rain or stored when damp or wet.  THE FOOT BOX OF THE BIVY REQUIRES MAXIMUM DURABILTY AS BOOTS CAN BE WORN INSIDE THE BIVY.  MARINES ARE VERY DISSATIFIED WITH THE WET WEATHER PROTECTION OF THE CURRE NT BIVY.  WATER MUST NOT MIGRATE THROUGH MATERIAL OR CONSTURCTION AFTER EXTENDED EXPOSURE TO RAIN OR PROLONGED PRESSURE CONTACT WITH PUDDLED WATER, CONDENSATION OR FROST.  A BIVY FEATURE THAT INCLUDES A STAND-OFF FROM THE FACE IS HIGHLY DESIRED BY MARINES.  MOREOVER, MARINES DESIRE THE VERSATILITY TO ATTACH THE COMPRESSED SLEEPING BAG HORIZONTALLY ON THE OUTSIDE OF THEIR MAIN ILBE PACK OR VERTICALLY ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE  ASSAULT PACK.  EXTERNAL SLEEPING BAG MOUNTING MUST BE WATERPROOF AGAINST SUBMERSION IN WATER OR UNDER PRESSURE. Durability: Components shall not degrade to ex tended periods of heavy military use and repeated stowage. The sleeping mat and bivy performance must not degrade from contact with the ground or when using item while wearing combat boots.  Items will not degrade from repeated stuffing and compression whe n stowed wet or damp iteratively for several days to temperatures as low as 0 degree Fahrenheit. MARINES ARE DISSATIFIED WITH FAILURES DUE TO THE FRAYED SEAM CONSTRUCTION IN THE SLEEPING BAG AND ZIPPER FAILURES IN THE BIVY SACK.   Cleaning:  The sleeping bag and bivy must maintain performance up to 20 machine wash and dry launderings at warm temperatures.  The compression stuff sack and mat must be able to be wiped clean and air dried, where machine washing of stuff sack is desired. Size:  IN COMBAT, MARINES WILL PERIODICALLY WEAR BOOTS INSIDE THEIR SLEEPING BAG AND MUST BE FACTORED INTO SIZING.  Two (2) lengths of sleeping bags are permissible where a regular length is suitable for a maximum height of 6 and a long length 6 to 65 (ADD 1.75 TO HEIGHT WHEN WEARING BOOTS). THE FOOT BOX NEEDS ACCOMMODATE THE USER WEARING BOOTS INSIDE THE BAG.  GENERAL GUIDANCE FOR THE FOOT BOX  IS SHOULDER WIDTH (ESTIMATED AT 25 INCH ES) AND LENGTH OF BOOT (ESTIMATED AT 13  TO 15 INCHES) FOR REGULAR A ND LONG RESPECTIVELY).      A single length bivy and sleeping mat is required.  The sleeping bag must have sufficient ease to accommodate Marines to wear multiple layers of clothing to increase insulation for 0 degree Fahrenheit use.  For reference, the cu rrent patrol bag provides acceptable ease for Large to XLarge marines wearing multiple clothing layers, WHILE CURRENT INTERMEDIATE BAG IS SHORT FOR TALL MARINES OVER 63.  A cylindrical packed shape provides versatility in placement in the ruck sack.  CYL INDER LENGTH OF 14 INCH MAXIMUM BY 7 INCH DIAMETER WAS HIGHLY RATED BY MARINES.  THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF 20 INCH, SPECIFIED IN THE ORIGINAL RFI, IS NO LONGER VALID.  Egress: Component closures must enable immediate and reliable opening for quick egress with no chance of trapping the Marine in the sleeping bag or bivy.  MARINES EXPECT ACCEPTABLE EGRESS FROM SHORTENED ZIPPER LENGTHS EXTENDING ONLY TO HIP OR MID THIGH.  C ONSTRUCTION MUST ENSURE ZIPPERS DO NOT CATCH IN MATERIAL WHEN QUICKLY OPERATED.   OTHER: -MARINES DESIRE A MESH POCKET(S) IN THE BIVY OR SLEEPING BAG WHERE THEY CAN PUT TOBACCO, WALLET, MINI FLASHLIGHT OR LIKE. -MINIMUM TIME IS REQUIRED FOR SET UP AND PACKING SLEEP SYSTEM WHERE 2-3 MINUTES SET UP/PACK UP IS DESIRED. - FEW ATTACHMENT POINTS TO SECURE THE BIVY AND BAG TOGETHR IS DESIRED.  AN ABILITY TO PACK THE BAG/BIVY FIXED TOGETHER AS ONE IS DESIRED. -HIGHLY WATER REPELLENT AND FAST DRYING TO MINIMIZE MILDEW GROWTH WHEN COMPONENTS PACKED WET OR DAMP. EVALUATION TIME LINE: USMC will evaluate product offerings and down select the items that prove significant improvement over the current items. The downselect items will be included in a field user evaluation (FUE) to determine operational effectiveness.  USMC plans to buy appr oximately 100 of each candidate in Jun 07 for September delivery to enable a 1 Oct to 20 Nov 2007 field user evaluation.  The FUE results will be utilized to select the best product for each system component based on what is most highly rated by Marines co mbined and good laboratory results.   USMC will pursue any improvements required to optimize the final candidates and procure the improved items during Dec 07 thru Feb 08 for a spring validation test in Mar to Apr 08.  If the validation results support ado pting a 3 season sleep system, USMC would proceed with a solicitation for initial fielding of 200,000 systems or components over 1 to3 years based upon salient characteristics of the successful items and availability of funding.  USMCs PM-ICE will share f indings from each phase with Army PM-Clothing and Individual Equipment for their awareness and consideration. SUBMISSION: Interested suppliers are invited to submit a sample of their product  offerings until AN EXTENDED SUBMISSION DATE OF 27 Apr 07.  Submitted items must include a representative sample,  ONE LINEAR YARD OF FABRIC SAMPLES INCLUDING: SLEEPING BAG CROSS SECTION, BIVY COVER, COMPRESSION STUFF SACK AND SLEEPING MAT, A 18 LENGTH SA MPLE OF THE SLEEPING BAG SEAM CONSTRUCTION, technical data quantifying its actual performance against USMC objectives, and estimated unit pricing based upon volume and USA manufacturing.  WHERE APPLICABLE, WHEN SUBMITTING KSU MANIKIN DATE, PROVIDE KSU DATA  FOR THE CURRENT BASELINE SYSTEM OF THE PATROL BAG/BIVY AND ISO MAT. Any item ultimately procured for fielding must be Buy American and Berry compliant.  Natick Solider Research, Development and Engineering Center is supporting the development of the 3 sea son sleep system for PM-ICE, MARCORSYSCOM, Quantico, VA. NOTE:  IF A COMPANY PREPARED SAMPLES TO MEET ORIGINAL SUBMISSION DATES AND THIS UPDATE NECESSITATES A CHANGE, SUBMIT YOUR SAMPLE WITH A THOROUGH DESCRIPTION OF MODIFICATION.  IF THE GOVERNMENT DOWNSE LECTS YOUR PRODUCT FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION, A MODIFIED SAMPLE WILL BE REQUIRED FOR CONFIRMATION PRIOR TO PROCURING TEST ITEMS.

<DESC>The following questions were submitted.  The answers follow each question. Please also note that Amendment #2 was mistakenly issued as Amendment #1.  There are currently two amendments that need to be acknowledged. Question 1. C.1.2.2 notes that the Air diffuser system from the main air supply to the aeration tank is to be removed and replaced.  There are 5ea diffuser assemblies in the aeration tank and 2ea diffuser assemblies in the sludge digester and storage tank.   It appears that 2ea diffuser assemblies in the sludge digester and storage tank are not being removed and replaced.  Please confirm. Answer 1: All Diffusers Are to be removed and Replaced Question 2. Please clarify the extent of the removal and replacement.  Does it include all piping from the 8 inches CIMJ Air Main or only the air piping from the air valves to the diffusers?  I assume the air valve will remain as they are not specifically called out as being removed and replaced?  Answer 2: The Piping will only be removed and replaced from the air valves to the diffusers. All the valves in this piping are gate valves they will be replaced with ball valves. Question 3. C.2.6 requires the deep bed sand filter media to be replaced per the manufacturer's instructions; however, the manufacturer is not given.  Please supply the original manufacturer of the equipment.  Also, we can only be held to the size limits s hown on page 32 of 36 and this information does not seem to be enough to assure proper operation of the system.  Answer 3: The original manufacture is LYCO.  The Specification listed on Page 32 were taken directly from the operation manual and this is what the contractor will be held to and is what is needed for proper operation.

Overview:  AETC plans a proof-of-concept study to collect data to aid leadership in determining future instructional technology solutions for aircrew training.  This data collection effort will require a vendor recommended hardware/software recommendation that will transform the current segregated ground-based training events to a multi-point access training system.  The goal is for students to have access to the pilot training ground based training curriculum anytime and anywhere to include their residence.  The specific course of instruction for this study will be the T-6 Joint Primary Pilot Training / (P-V4A-J).  Ground training is currently taught via traditional instructor led classroom, computer based training, part task trainer missions, and table-top flight line instruction.
This is not a training system acquisition.  AETC is seeking to acquire only that level of a software/hardware solution that will provide sufficient data to determine the viability of anytime, anywhere ground based training versus the current training system.

System Requirements:
1) The vendor must be able to survey the SUPT training environment and make recommendations for a portable electronic device or devices capable of displaying the consolidated portions of the current GBTS. 

2) The vendor must be able to capture the current instructional material from Authorware, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, standard audio/video training segments as well as paper-based material and then convert the current training material for display on portable devices.

3) The vendor must be able to develop the portable devices for access to training material anytime and anywhere to include data access points, high speed wireless and wired connections, and portable input devices.

4) The vendor must be able to connect the portable training devices to the existing Training Information Management System (TIMS) for the purposes of updating student training records and records review by training personnel. 

5) The vendor shall provide approximately 90 portable devices with a one-year service contract for the maintenance of each device.

6) The vendor must provide specific examples of how the effectiveness of the anytime anywhere training system can be evaluated in comparison to the current training system.

Small Business (SB) Set-Aside Determination:
The Government reserves the right to decide whether or not a SB set-aside is appropriate for this acquisition based on responses to this notice.  In order for the Government to make a SB set-aside determination, it is emphasized that SB concerns provide sufficient written information to indicate their capability to successfully perform and manage all the requirements of this magnitude.  In the solicitation, the extent to which prime contractors provide for the significant use of small and small disadvantaged business subcontractors will be a consideration in the evaluation of proposals.

Points of Contact:

Refer your questions, comments, or suggestions via the Request for Information on the FedBizOpps web site.  Additional information or updates will be posted at the www.fbo.gov.  It is the responsibility of interested parties to check this site regularly for any changes or updates.

It is NAVFAC, SE?s intent to award five (5) separate contracts defined by geographic areas.  Installations include, but are not limited to, Naval Bases, Marine Bases, Air Force Bases, and Navy and Marine Corps Reserve Centers.  These new Contracts will align with NAVFAC SE?s area of responsibility, which is broken into 3 major areas covered each by an Integrated Product Team (IPT):

<DESC>Introduction If you market a centrifugal pump that either meets or could potentially meet the requirements for either of the two pumps described below, please take time to participate in this market research.     Please submit your response no later than 14 May 07 Narrative The US Army is interested in gathering information on commercially available pumping assemblies for use in both tank farms and pipeline operations.  We are interested in information on pump assemblies that you feel could be used in our applications, whethe r they meet all of the requirements identified below or not.                       Two separate pump assemblies are of interest.  The first would be capable of pumping both fuel and water at a capacity of 600 GPM at 350 feet total head.  The second would be capable of pumping both fuel and water at a capacity of 800 GPM at 1800 feet tota l head.  Although the same model of pump will be used in both fuel and water applications, a pump designated by the Army to pump fuel will not be used in water applications, and a pump designated for water will not be used in fuel applications.  The pump a ssemblies must be capable of both over the highway and off-road transport and operate on JP-8 fuel.  JP-8 fuel is used by the military and is equivalent to Jet A-1 with three additive inhibitors.  Jet A-1 is used at all U.S. Airports for commercial aircraf t.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY LW30mm APACHE TECH DEMO This is a market survey only. It is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal. The US Army, Office of the Project Manager for Maneuver Ammunition Systems (OPM-MAS) and the U.S. Army Aviation Warfighting Center plan to host a 30mm x 113mm (Light Weight 30mm) target practice spotter ammunition technology demonstration at Fort Rucker area, AL. The anticipated timeframe of demonstration is in the September-October 2007 timeframe, the demonstration will last approximately 3 days.  The desired performance of a 30mm TP-spotter is for the projectile to have an impact signature which is:   1. Visible day and night unaided human eye. 2. Visible through the Apache FLIR 3. Visible through night vision goggles 4. Ballistic trajectory similar to the M788 cartridge. 5. Non-hazardous to personnel and unarmored vehicles if it does not function as intended (e.g. dud) The technology demonstration is intended to demonstrate items 1-3 for crews in Apache helicopters while in flight from ranges up to 3000m. Items 4 & 5 should be considered but demonstrating these attributes is not necessary for this spotter technology demonstration.  It must be noted that this is not a â€œtracedâ€ cartridge, but a cartridge with a visible signature only upon impact with a target. A ground or tower mounted 30mm cannon will be used for the demonstration. Demonstrations of the 30mm ammunition will be fired from this stationary weapon while being observed from helicopter(s) in positions closely related to training scenarios. Helicopter(s), flight crews, weapon, test equipment, test facilities and test personnel will be provided by the US Army OPM-TMAS, the US Army Aviation War-fighting Center, the US Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC).   This notice is seeking contractor participation in the demonstration.  Participating contractors will be required to provide a sample of 200 TP-spotter cartridges delivered to Ft. Rucker, AL at by the end of August 2007.  The Contractors will be responsible for obtaining shipping hazard classification for the ammunition. Contractors will be required to supply ammunition design details sufficient to obtain safety clearance at the test site. It is expected that the contractor(s) participating in the demonstration will provide the above at no cost to the Government.  The government intends to limit this demonstration to contractors from within the National Technology Industrial Base. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. Interested parties responding to this market survey should send their information and comments within 15 days to: Commander, US Army, Joint Munitions & Lethality LCMC Acquisition Center, AMSML-AQ-MA, Bldg. 10, ATTN: Eric Wagner, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000.

<SUBJECT>A -- Target Files Software
<DESC>Whether it’s a hostage situation or a drug bust, Special Response Teams (SRTs) are asked to risk their lives every time they are called to work. They are asked to bring criminals to justice while at the same time saving the lives of others who may be in harms way.  

To aid Special Response Teams, the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has developed a simple-to-use electronic system for cataloguing and managing target files and target folders. By using INL’s Target Files application, SRTs will increase their chance of walking into a hostile situation equipped with the information they need.

The Target Files application is in use at the INL, where it gives INL SRTs the ability to plan for protection of INL personnel and materials located in INL facilities.  With the quick data access that the application provides, INL SRTs can respond swiftly and intelligently in the event of aggressor attack or hostage situation.  This software program also provides an electronic means of documenting target information as required in DOE Order DOE O 473.2.

In the INL Target Files application, users first input and access general information about the site location, such as road maps, weather, etc. Next, users identify buildings and/or site areas of interest. Users may then add additional information about each area, such as building floor plans with locations marked to display 360o immersive photography. Each of the locations showing 360o immersive photography can connect to additional hot spots, such as windows or doors to new locations. Users can click on each door and window on the floor plan to display additional rich text documents with additional related information.  Documentation for SRT observer/precision shooter and reconnaissance personnel, building and area general information may also be available for each building. Users who access the information click on the item of interest and may then print, update and/or save additional data.

Target Files has several features that may be effectively integrated into a special response situation. Some of these features are: 
•	Easy-to-use interface
•	Portable
•	Easy download of files
•	Easy integration of 360° images, flat graphics, and text documents
•	Building walk-throughs
•	Easily customized
•	Easy to add data
•	Ready-to-use for SRT
•	Data ready for crisis management

While the Target Files application is ready-to-use by SRTs, it could be expanded to collect other information about facilities.  Logical extensions of the product include customization for the real estate industry, facility/inventory data management for insurance purposes, campus management, and other applications where the integration of text documents and graphics is preferred.

The INL is soliciting interest from qualified companies interested in commercializing this technology.  Intellectual property may be licensed exclusively or non-exclusively. The INL invites interested parties to contact us regarding the details of licensing and implementing this technology.  Interested parties should submit expressions of interest on or before June 1, 2007.  For questions regarding the technology, licensing, and working with the INL, please contact Charity Follett:

This notice is not intended to solicit for proposals and no responses are anticipated. 

The current contract was competitively solicited and awarded 28 April 2004 as a Cost Plus Fixed Fee Contract with a 3 year base period and 2 one year award term options.  In the fall of 2005, the program was decremented $535M resulting in a change in the execution of the program.  JPMG made a decision to provide a core response capability to military installations rather than totally cease execution.  This interim program is referred to as IPP ?Lite?.  The program consists of providing a core emergency response capability, an Incident Management System (IMS) and a Mass Notification System (MNS).  

The  increase to the period of performance (PoP) of the existing contract will support the continuation and completion of current Installation Protection Program ?Lite? efforts associated with installation survey, design, fielding, training, testing, maintenance and sustainment through 31 Oct 08.  The revised PoP allows for consideration of implementation activities as well as 1 year Contractor Logistical Support for fielded installations.  This phasing of the installations as they are completed will require the period of performance to extend through October 08.  A competitive solicitation process, for the follow-on effort, is currently ongoing and scheduled to be awarded in late FY07, to execute a revised multi-tiered Installation Protection Program beginning in FY08.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY 7-MeV Neutron Interrogation Based Scanner for Detection of Special Nuclear Material In Cargo Shipments
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
7-MeV Neutron Interrogation Based Scanner for Detection of Special Nuclear Material In Cargo Shipments
 
Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to partner with LLNL to further develop a neutron interrogation system to detect special nuclear materials (SNM) in cargo containers. This technology addresses applications associated with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DOD), and DOE. In preparation for possible future solicitations from the U.S. Government for an advanced demonstration of this technology, LLNL is seeking potential commercial partners that could respond to such a solicitation.

Background:	Improving security at U.S. seaports is one of the nation?s most difficult technical and practical challenges. Detection of contraband such as special nuclear materials (SNM) in closed containers is of growing concern internationally for security reasons. High-energy photon (radiography) inspection systems remain one of the only technologies capable of inspecting loaded cargo containers and vehicles.	

Description: 	This invention provides a new concept and technology for sensitive and reliable
detection of SNM in cargo shipments. Lab researchers have designed and tested a neutron interrogation system for cargo containers. This system quickly screens incoming shipments to ensure that nuclear materials such as plutonium and highly enriched uranium (HEU) are not smuggled into the U.S. Potential concepts of operations for the Livermore system include irradiating suspicious containers or zones within containers identified by radiography with neutrons to actively search for nuclear materials. A truck carrying a container laden with suspicious cargo would pass by the neutron generator or be positioned in front of the generator and irradiated with neutrons. The cargo container would then be passed through an array of detectors optimized to detect the unique SNM signatures.

 
Advantages: This technology is a new approach for interrogation of suspect cargos. The primary
features of this concept that are considered unique include:
?	Medium-energy (3-7 MeV) neutrons are utilized to provide enhanced cargo penetration and reduced activation of cargo materials that would interfere with detection
?	Beta-delayed gamma?nrays characteristic of induced fission in the SNM are detected in a large, pixelated, linear array of detectors to provide high detection efficiency and to locate the contraband SNM in the cargo
?	Characteristic decay half-life is utilized along with its high energy to identify SNM and to distinguish it from other interfering sources to improve sensitivity
?	This technique allows substantial suppression of background and interferences which increases detection sensitivity

Benefits:  Gamma-ray sensitivity is very high, thus enabling small amounts of special nuclear material to be detected. See S&TR article titled: ?Screening Cargo Containers? for more information. http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/profile/announcement/documents/screening_cargo_containersarticle.pdf

Development Status: A patent application has been filed for this invention.

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information. 

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process. 

Note: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. Companies interested in commercializing this LLNL technology to detect special nuclear materials in cargo shipments should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Name of company, location(s) and descriptions including
a.	Recent annual report or other overview of your organization and the team that you are proposing 
b.	Experience relevant to working on Federally funded joint projects
c.	Experience with developing and commercializing accelerator-based radiation detection technologies
d.	Experience with Department of Homeland Security

<SUBJECT>--PORTABLE AIRCRAFT POWER SUPPLY UNIT AND CHARGING
<DESC>The Directorate of Contracting (DOC), Fort Campbell, KY, has a requirement for 8 each Coolspool29 portable power units and 4 each PS80 quick charge units, both items manufactured by Powervamp.  The procurement will be conducted on a sole source basis  in accordance with the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The Agency intends to enter into a firm-fixed-price, supply-type contract with the sole US distributor of Powervamp products, Marvel Aero International, Inc . located in Lake Forest, CA.  The basis for restricting competition is that the Power Units provide sufficient power (28.5 Volts) for required maintenance checks, have a quick recharge time and are approved for air transport.  The items have proven reliab ility operating in sandy/dusty conditions and are repairable by the customer when required.  In addition, the small size of the power unit (11.8 inches x15.75 inches x5.31inch) and resistance to tipping over are required for storing and transporting on the  aircraft.  Failure to acquire the power unit and charging unit will significantly degrade the ability of the aircrews to properly maintain their aircraft in support of OEF/OIF combat operations.  Power & charging units will be delivered to Fort Campbell, KY .  NAICS code for this procurement is 336413 and the small business size standard is 1,000 employees.  This sole source requirement will be procured under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition, and awarded on an unre stricted basis.

Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete  the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion for the Government.  If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the sole source negotiation with the distributor, Marvel Aero Inc.  See Number ed Note 22.  Numbered Notes can be viewed at http://www.fbo.gov/Numbered_Notes.html.  Responses are due by 18 April 2007, 3:00 p.m. (CST).

<DESC>This Broad Agency Announcement solicits proposals from private industry, non-profit organizations, states and local governments for projects addressing the adoption and application of new technology in railroad services which are a key focus in the Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA) research and development program.  A negotiated contract, grant, or cooperative agreement may result from an accepted proposal depending upon the nature of the proposed project and/or the nature of the offeror/applicant.  This is an unrestricted solicitation for demonstrations of various technologies or techniques related to the following areas:  (1) grade crossing hazard mitigation system; (2) positive train control (PTC); (3) wireless communication system; (4) train tracking system; (5) risk assessment and hazard analysis; (6) PTC/communications enabling projects.  The area of advanced train control and dispatching systems, such as PTC, is of particular interest.  PTC uses microprocessors, advanced navigation and tracking systems, and wireless technology to interconnect the various segments of railroad operations to virtually eliminate train to train collisions and over-speed derailments, as well as to provide roadway worker protection.  Technologies most likely to facilitate the improvement of railroad services are those which will (1) improve safety by reducing human and technology failures; (2) bring about capital cost reductions and economy in producing equipment and facilities; (3) reduce operating costs of rail service by providing more efficient operations; (4) improve the reliability of equipment and infrastructure components by reducing failures and/or reducing false failure detections; (5) enhance the revenue-generating capability of high-speed operations by attracting greater ridership by reducing trip times, upgrading customer service quality, increasing reliability, or improving on time performance; and/or (6) enhance the social benefits and/or environmental aspects of high-speed rail.  Parties interested in this solicitation may submit proposals in accordance with the BAA-2007-1 package which can be downloaded or printed from the following Internet website:  http://www.fra.dot.gov.  Follow the selections of RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (upper left of home page menu), FUNDS FOR RESEARCH, and BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT 2007-1.  Further technical program details and specfic instructions for submitting proposals are contained in BAA-2007-1 on the website.  BAA 2007-1 is NOT available in paper copy.

This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Request For Quotation (RFQ) number is N66604-07-Q-2750. Incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2000-07. This is 100% set-aside for small business. Size standard is 100. NUWC Division Newport intends to purchase the following items:  1500 each of Airborn receptacle connectors for mating to CAVES LVA Half-Stave Harness sensors in accordance with Airborn Part# MG121-007-213-2200-Q08.  Required delivery is 30 days after award, F.O.B. Destination Naval Station Newport; Newport, RI. It is expected to place a purchase order with Gemini Electronic Components, Inc., 420 Columbus Ave., Valhalla, NY 10595-1381 who is a distributor for Airborn. They are the only known source for these items because Gemini Electronic Components already has a custom-made “pair” design.  Having a different vendor attempt to design, build, and test another connector to mate to the existing CAVES LVA sensor assembly would be greatly time consuming and more expensive.  It would also place the CAVES LVA Program, as a whole, in a high risk position.  Airborn owns the proprietary information necessary to guarantee a connector pair that would be compatible with the existing CAVES LVA hardware.  All other timely offers will be considered. Offers for other products must contain complete product information and prices. FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items applies. Evaluation will be in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items. Evaluation factors are technical capability, price and past performance. Each is equally important.

<CONTACT>Elizabeth Buchholz,CGMP Event Manager/Contracting Officer Dept. of Veterans Affairs, EES 950 22nd Street North-Suite 500 Birmingham, AL  35203-5300
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to negotiate a Firm Fixed Price type contract for Hotel Accommodations, Conference Space Rental and Hotel Services located in one of the following geographic areas:  Colorado Springs, CO; Austin, TX or Kansas City, MO.    Request for Proposal VA-777-07-RP-0016  is in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6-Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items. This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.  For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a hotel, the offeror, not the hotel, is to be considered the prime contractor.  Therefore, that offeror must describe in its proposal the technical approach for the offeror's services as a prime contractor and must also include a copy of all insurance(s) (standard business, liability, extraordinary insurances) in order to submit a complete technical proposal for evaluation purposes.  (Again, this is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.  An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable.)   This announcement incorporates FAR provisions and clauses in effect through  FAR FAC 2005-16, Effective March 22, 2007 VAAR 97-10. NAICS Code 721110 and the small business size standard is $6 million.  This BOS announcement/solicitation is solicited unrestricted and constitutes the only bid document that will be issued.

A Hotel Contract shall be submitted with your technical and price proposal, along with descriptive literature to include sleeping rooms, meeting room space, diagrams and square footage, information (availability/cost) on amenities of hotel i.e., parking, shuttle services; transportation to/from airport, menus.  The hotel facility must be FEMA approved and listed on the U.S. Fire Administration Hotel and Motel National Master List found at  http://www.usfa.fema.gov/hotel/search.cfm.  In accordance with FAR 52.204.7 - Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003); contractors are Required To Register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database http://www.ccr.gov,  PRIOR to award of any contract.

<DESC>Amendment 01 to Combined Synopsis/Solicitation is issued to provide Reclamation's response to questions submitted. Q:  As a Schedule Contractor we have to have apparel that is made and assembled in either the US or an approved country such as Mexico which is part of NFTA. I believe that your document is requesting US product only which in some of these items is hard to find. Is that correct? A:  Reclamation has reviewed the Trade Agreement provisions of this Request for Proposal and makes the following changes under Contract Clauses 52.212-05 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items.  1.  Delete the requirement for (b) (23) 52.225-1 Buy American Act - Supplies,   	 2.  Incorporate the requirement for (b) (25) 52.225-5 Trade Agreements and accompanying clause 52.225-6 Trade Agreements Certificate. Q: We have provided Fire Resistant apparel to the Northern California Area Office and Grand Coulee Dam in the past. In the document you reference power plants but do not list this type of apparel in the item list. Is this not part of the package or am I not viewing this correctly? A:  Line items 31, 35, 36 and 41 under the Uniform Tab of the Schedule of Items call for Nomex flame resistant fabric.  Any other items of this nature may be considered safety items and are not included in this Request for Proposal.

<DESC>AMENDMENT NOTICE: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; bids are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is 1092-730005b and is issued as an invitation for bids (IFB), unless otherwise indicated herein. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-15. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334119 with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and only qualified offerors may submit bids. The solicitation pricing on www.FedBid.com will start on the date this solicitation is posted and will end on 2007-04-16 13:00:00.0 Eastern Time or as otherwise displayed at www.FedBid.com.

FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. An Offeror may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. Department of State is taking this action in an effort to improve both vendor access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids. All responsible Offerors that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.

Should offerors require additional clarification, contact Harry Lundy at lundyhe@state.gov or FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com.<BR><BR> Use of FedBid: Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use.  Buyers and Sellers understand that FedBid ranks all bids by price; however, pursuant to applicable acquisition regulations and/or departmental guidelines, Buyers may use criteria other than price to evaluate offers.  Accordingly, please note that, unless otherwise specified herein below, to the extent required by applicable regulations and/or guidelines, award will be made to the responsible Seller whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Buyer on the basis of price, technical capability, delivery, and past performance.<BR><BR> In addition to providing pricing at www.FedBid.com for this solicitation, each Offeror must provide any required, NON-PRICING responses (e.g. technical proposal, representations and certifications, etc.) so that they are received no later than the closing date and time for this solicitation.<BR><BR>Contact ClientServices@FedBid.com or call 1-877-9FEDBID to address any questions of comments<BR><BR>Agencies may require registration with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to receipt of order.

The Department owns perpetual software licenses for the current baseline products – however, to support more users, additional licenses and support is needed. Microstrategy software is the basis for measuring the performance of ILMS. The software and support services needed to accomplish this task in ILMS include: MicroStrategy WebReporter, MicroStrategy Office, MicroStrategy Web Professional, MicroStrategy Intelligence Server, MicroStrategy Report Services, MicroStrategy OLAP Services, MicroStrategy SDK, and MicroStrategy Bronze Technical Support A full description of the software and support services that are required can be found on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule for MicroStrategy.<BR><BR>Due to the proprietary nature of the MicroStrategy software, the required software and support is available only from MicroStrategy. The software and support described in paragraph 3 is crucial for measuring the performance of ILMS. ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System. In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc. ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the MicroStrategy software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support. Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure software and support from MicroStrategy would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the ability to measure the performance of ILMS.<BR><BR>

First and foremost is for the sake of continuity, familiarity and simplicity. The Suzuki Z400 is the current model that the Yuma Station and the Yuma Sector BORSTAR have in use.  The Suzuki Z400s are used on daily basis and have consistently proven their reliability and worth.  We also have mechanically inclined Border Patrol Agents that are knowledgeable in servicing this particular model and have been doing so with the ATVs that the Station already has. Because the Suzuki Z400 is compact and lightweight, it is more than capable of traversing the high sand dunes of the Imperial National Park. Its' high compression ratio and straight intake tract give it the necessary torque needed to effortlessly climb the high dunes.  The sand dunes of the Imperial National Park is the area of operations where the Suzuki Z400 will mainly be used. The Suzuki Z400 also features a five speed transmission and a much needed reverse gear.  Not all models in this class have a reverse gear.  The Suzuki Z400 has a four stroke, liquid cooled engine.  The four stroke engine eliminates the need for a gas/oil mixture that other ATV two stroke engines would require. In comparison to other brand names in a similar ATV class, the Suzuki Z400 is exactly what we want for our needs.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This amendment is issued to extend the due date to April 17, 2007 and provide a response to the below questions.

Question:	Could you please provide a full model # and serial # of any one of the pumps so that we can get an accurate dimensional drawing for the pump. The Gould API-610 series has several variations.
Government Response:	This requirement includes two types of Gould Pumps:  Two (2) are model 3700M, 970 GPM, 34 FT of Head, 1150 RPMs and two (2) are model 3700, 810 GPM, 36 Ft of Head, and 1150 RPMS
Serial numbers are: 
200C961-1
200C961-2
200C960-1
200C960-2
Question:	Are the pumps located outside, or in a building?
Government Response:	Pumps are inside, in a basement mechanical room.
Question:	Are there any overhead cranes, or lifting equipment, that we can use, or do we need to bring our own?
Government Response:	The government will provide a portable hydraulic lift and a dolly for movement of the pumps. 
Question:	Within the Scope of work at (c) iii it states, replacement of worn parts, including new gaskets and bolts. We obviously cannot quote to replace worn parts, until we have disassembled the individual pumps and evaluated them. How do you want us to handle this? We can quote basic overhaul (seals, gaskets, etc), but what if the pump is damaged and requires new shafts, etc.
Government Response:	The replacement of a shaft would be considered extraordinary and is not to be included in the offered price quote.  However, all other  replacement parts or pump repair shall be included. 

Proposals shall be submitted by email only to Kyle A. Turner at:  turnerky@mail.nih.gov Proposals are due by 3:00 p.m. EST on April 17, 2007.     No phone calls will be accepted.

Statement of Work

A. Background Information: The National Library of Medicine (NLM) indexes more than 600,000 articles annually from more than 5,000 journals for MEDLINE, NLM’s premier bibliographic database that contains over 15 million citations to journal articles in the life sciences with a concentration on biomedicine.  MEDLINE is the major component of PubMed, NLM’s free online bibliographic information and retrieval service (available at pubmed.gov).   Subject indexing for MEDLINE consists of application of appropriate subject headings from NLM’s controlled vocabulary, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH).  Indexing policies are specified in the NLM Indexing Manual, technical memoranda, and other indexing aids. Nearly 200 individuals, including NLM staff, contractors, and staff at cooperating national and international centers participate in indexing for MEDLINE/PubMed.  Although there is a high degree of quality assurance review and computerized checking and validation built into the MEDLINE indexing production stream, it is inevitable because of the large volume of work that a few indexing errors may appear in completed MEDLINE citations.  The purpose of this project is to formulate strategies to search MEDLINE to detect potential indexing errors, perform those searches on newly-indexed citations on a regular, recurring basis, and to review the search results to identify specific indexing errors that require correction. 

B. Purpose and Objective:   To acquire services to formulate strategies to search PubMed to detect potential indexing errors in MEDLINE citations, perform those searches on newly-indexed citations on a regular, recurring basis, and to review the search results to identify specific indexing errors that require correction.

C. Contractor Requirements: Using advanced PubMed search capabilities, the Contractor will formulate PubMed search strategies to identify those citations that are likely to include an indexing error (usually an inappropriate MeSH heading or a missing MeSH heading). For a very simple example, a search would be developed to retrieve citations with the text word “mouse” or “mice” in the citation title or abstract, but without the MeSH heading MICE.  The Contractor will print out the results of each PubMed search performed, and hand mark the printout to indicate which MeSH term(s) should be added or deleted.  Actual maintenance of MEDLINE citations will be performed by NLM.  The Contractor will also store each PubMed search strategy to be rerun at approximately one-month intervals to detect errors in newly-added citations. There are currently about 40 existing stored searches to detect indexing errors, and the Contractor will run those at approximately one-month intervals, but it is anticipated that additional searches will be needed in the future. The Contractor will submit the marked printouts to NLM not later than the first week of each month.   If the Contractor works at a site outside of the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the marked printouts will be sent to NLM via FedEx.   The Contractor will also submit monthly reports indicating how many searches were performed and how many corrections were marked on citation printouts; such monthly reports should be submitted to NLM within the first week of each month.

D. Government Responsibilities: NLM will provide the overall guidance and approval of submitted work. NLM will communicate to the Contractor the specific “topic” for which a new, additional search strategy is needed to detect indexing errors (the contractor will not on their own identify new “topics” for which new search strategies might be needed).  If the Contractor works outside of the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the NLM will provide Contractor with FedEx airbills for shipment of marked search results.
