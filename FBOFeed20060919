<CONTACT>Tom Williamson Acting Chief of Concessions  3039692582     tom_williamson@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service anticipates issuing a Prospectus this winter season for providing automobile service station operations in Yellowstone National Park.  Since most of the facilities will be inaccessible during the winter season, parties interested in this business opportunity can view the properties during a scheduled site visit on Tuesday, October 10, 2006.  The site visit is not required to submit a proposal for the Prospectus, but attendance is encouraged.  The site visit will begin at 8:00 a.m. at Yellowstone National Park Headquarters Office at Mammoth.  No questions specific to the Prospectus will be entertained during the site visit.  Questions specific to the Prospectus will be answered after the Prospectus is issued.  The site visit will view existing concession facilities and address questions about the existing Concession Contract.  Service stations related to this contract are located at each major developed area throughout the Park.  The traditional operating season for the service stations is generally from mid April to mid October.  As a result of the National Park Service Concessions Management Improvement Act of 1998, the current concessioner does not have a preference in the renewal of its contract.  The annual gross receipts for this Concession Contract averaged $5.1 million from 2001 through 2005.  Interested parties must R.S.V.P. by close of business (4:30 pm) Friday, October 6, 2006 to Judy Jennings, Chief, Business Management Division, Yellowstone National Park at 307-344-2270, or via email at judy_jennings@nps.gov.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs (DOE) Industrial Technologies Program has initiated a nationwide effort to help industrial facilities identify opportunities for saving energy, and thereby cut operating costs. To achieve this objective, DOE is sponsoring Energy Savings Assessments (ESAs) in large U.S. industrial plants to be conducted by Energy Savings Assessment Qualified Specialists, herein known as ‚ÄúESA Experts‚Äù.  ESAs will be conducted during calendar year 2007 by DOE "Qualified Specialists" that are certified by DOE as ESA Experts and are listed on the DOE Qualified Bidders List for 2007. Qualified Specialists are individuals who have satisfied the DOE Specialist Qualification training program requirements, and thus have demonstrated - by passing an examination - that they are proficient in the use of one or more of the DOE industrial systems software tools including AirMaster+ (AM+), Fan System Assessment Tool (FSAT), Process Heating Assessment and Survey Tool (PHAST), Pumping Systems Assessment Tool (PSAT), or the Steam System Assessment Tool Suite (SSAT).  ESA Experts are individual ‚ÄúQualified Specialists‚Äù who have completed DOE‚Äôs ESA Training; one-day Energy Savings Assessment Training session and a one-day ‚ÄúLessons Learned‚Äù workshop. The primary objective of the ESA is to identify opportunities for plant staff to improve the efficiency of their compressed air, fan, process heating, pumping, or steam systems. Therefore, DOE, through this announcement, is soliciting ‚ÄúQualified Specialists‚Äù interested in becoming ESA Experts through attending training provided by DOE for certification as ESA Experts.  Once certified, DOE will place the ESA Expert on a Qualified Bidders List (QBL) for future procurement opportunities in calendar year 2007.    Those ESA Experts on the QBL will compete for individual awards for performing ESAs, unless issued on a sole source basis from the list as determined by the Government. All current Qualified Specialists interested in being selected for the Qualified Bidders List of ESA Experts must submit a response to this notice and provide the following information for evaluation: a) Evidence of satisfactory completion of the DOE Specialist Qualification training program requirements, which demonstrates proficiency in the use of one or more of the DOE industrial system assessment tools including AirMaster+ (AM+), Fan System Assessment Tool (FSAT), Process Heating Assessment and Survey Tool (PHAST), Pumping Systems Assessment Tool (PSAT), or the Steam System Assessment Tool Suite (SSAT).  This is a Qualification Requirement, and only those Qualified Specialists meeting this criterion will be considered and evaluated further. b) Provide a resume describing the technical qualifications, relevant experience, professional experience, education, background, accomplishments, specific training, studies and other pertinent information relative to the tasks necessary to perform the attached Statement of Work SOW) for all proposed personnel.  Note:  this is limited to 5 pages. c) For each resume submitted, provide the number of previous assessments performed using the DOE Assessment Tool and a brief description of energy savings opportunities identified for each assessment. d) A description of past performance involving application of the DOE Assessment Tool in industrial plants. Note: This is limited to no more than 3 references for assessments completed within the last five years.  Include the following information for industrial plants where you have applied the DOE Assessment Tool: i. Name of the customer, point of contact and current phone number and email address ii. Brief description of how the DOE Assessment Tool was applied. iii. Brief description of the results obtained using the DOE Assessment Tool. The applicable Statement of Work is provided below as an electronic file available for downloading. All responses to this notice must be received in IIPS by the time and date specified in order to be considered and evaluated for placement on the QBL for 2007. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business.  The applicable NAICS code is   541690 with a size standard of $6.5 Million.

<CONTACT>Robert Carpenter, Contracting Officer, Phone (202)493-6153, Fax (202)493-6171, Email robert.carpenter@fra.dot.gov - Illona Williams, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 493-6130, Fax (202) 493-6171, Email illona.williams@fra.dot.gov
<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has a requirement for contracted services supporting the Automated Track Inspection Program (ATIP) involving operation, preventive and remedial maintenance, track data analysis and management, hardware and software track inspection devices, other associated equipment, and supporting services for FRA's fleet of track geometry cars.  The car fleet includes the following:  DOTX 217 is a state-of-the-art rail bound, high-speed, self-propelled geometry car that began regulatory inspection service in February 2001. DOTX 219 and DOTX 220 are new FRA geometry cars expected to be ready for regulatory service early in 2007.  ATIP may also utilize FRA's Research and Development cars (DOTX 216 and DOTX 218) to conduct regulatory inspections and other program requirements.

Since 1974, the national deployment of FRA's ATIP track geometry inspection cars has been an important element in FRA's oversight role in American railroad safety compliance programs. The broad purpose of ATIP is to minimize the risk of a train accident, potentially including a catastrophic hazardous material incident by accurately collecting and disseminating track geometry information and intelligence to FRA and respective railroads. The data collected by the ATIP cars provides supplemental assistance to all railroad Inspectors through advance detection of potential accident-causing hazards by identifying noncompliant and unsafe track geometry locations and conditions needing evaluation and remediation.  FRA also anticipates potential need for ATIP to support requests from other U.S. Government agencies for track inspections.  These may include, but are not necessarily limited to, Department of Energy track inspections prior to nuclear fuel shipping and Department of Defense STRACNET route surveys, and the Department of State.  

The requirement includes contractor services in three areas of responsibility.  These three areas of responsibility have been identified as A, B, and C corresponding to their respective North American Industrial Classification System codes.  In order to optimize competition and exposure to potentially interested vendors for the inter-related areas of responsibility, FRA has synopsized the whole requirement using three distinct solicitation numbers with separate NAICS codes because of the limitation of one NAICS code in www.fedbizopps.gov for each numbered solicitation.  The actual RFP solicitation will be issued for all three areas combined using one number, DTFR53-06-R-00009.  The three areas of responsibility are as follows:   

(A) Operations and maintenance of FRA's geometry car fleet, including all labor, equipment, materials, and transportation necessary to operate and maintain the government-owned geometry cars safely and efficiently, accurately record track geometry data, perform corrective and preventative maintenance work, and make the necessary adjustments required to keep the cars and ATIP geometry equipment and instrumentation functioning properly (NAICS Code 541330); 

(B) Maintain an integrated, centralized, and comprehensive ATIP track data analysis and database management system to manage, store, and provide access for all concerned users (Government and railroads) to all essential information extracted from historical and contemporary ATIP track inspections for the purpose scheduling track maintenance activities and future inspections (NAICS Code 518210); and 

(C) Maintain the hardware and software applications (i.e., Digital Track Notebook, GeoEdit, eBAR, Chordinator) used by track Inspectors to enter information found during manual and ATIP geometry car inspections that can be uploaded into FRA's consolidated safety databases (NAICS Code 54151).  

The estimated overall dollar value for this requirement is in the range of $60-80 million over a period of five years.  There will NOT be an "all or none" restriction for offers in response to the Request for Proposals.  Offerors may propose on one, two, or all three areas of responsibility for this requirement.  It is anticipated that one or more performance-based, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) service contract(s), including cost-plus-fixed-fee and/or fixed price type contracts, may be awarded to address the three areas of responsibility mentioned above.  The anticipated contract(s) will have a base period of one year and four additional one-year option periods.  Individual task orders will be issued under the contract(s) to address specific program requirements, as they are identified and funded.  

The Request for Proposals will be issued through electronic media available for downloading via the Internet at http://fedbizopps.gov.  NO PAPER COPIES OF THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE.  Prospective offerors shall be responsible for monitoring the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and should register themselves to receive automatic electronic notification of amendments thereto (if any), including responses to any questions submitted in accordance with the solicitation provisions.  The Request for Proposals will be an unrestricted solicitation, and all responsible sources may submit an offer.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will utilize written proposals in combination with oral presentations.  

Tentative procurement milestones for this requirement are:  
(1) Issuance of RFP on or about OCT 5, 2006; 
(2) Proposals due on or about NOV 17, 2006; 
(3) Oral presentations during the week of DEC 11-15, 2006; 
(4) Initiation of negotiations on or about JAN 12, 2007; and, 
(5) Contract award on or about JAN 26, 2007.   

These tentative milestones are provided for planning purposes.  While subject to potential slight variations, the time schedule required to meet the contemplated award date mandates that requests for time extensions for written proposals and/or oral presentations may not be honored.

MEMORANDUM FOR 21CONS/LGCBA

Date: 18 September 06

FROM: NORAD-USNORTHCOM/J624

SUBJECT:  Justification for Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition Procedures, AVAYA telephone cards and services.

1.  This memorandum is provided to the 21st Contraction Squadron as a justification for other than full and open competition for AVAYA to expand the conference for NORAD-USNORTHCOM to it?s maximum capability on the existing switch.  Estimated cost for this project is $.

2.  United States Northern Command N-NC J62 currently has conferencing bridge capabilities provided through the base telephone exchange switch.  The first requirement is to activate current existing cards to expand the conference capabilities to their current switch without degradation to existing services.  The second operation need is to acquire additional circuit cards to further expand to the maximum allowable capabilities on the existing switch.  Directives DoD 3020.26 Defense Continuity Program (DCP) and DoD 8500.2 for applying integrated, layered protection of the DoDD information systems apply to this purchase.  

3.  The AVAYA telephone exchange switch, provided via the 21st Space communications squadron is the only telephone switch on the base that provides this capability.
 
4.  FAR 6.302-1 applies to this purchase.  This is a purchase to expand on an existing system, and there would be a substantial duplication of costs to rebuild the system.  If another vendor is used, additional switches would need to be installed, as well as costs expended to train the personnel to maintain this critical infrastructure.  Duplication of funds and personnel would occur due to the fact that existing service would not cover non-AVAYA equipment, and new personnel would not service or maintain existing switching equipment. There would also be a learning curve and interruption of mission support.  Both are difficult to measure.

5.  The brand name hardware and software listed in the attachment is the standard for Peterson AFB, and is what is currently maintained by 21st Communication Squadron personnel.  

6.  The required hardware and software are available from AVAYA only. 

7.   The contracting officer has determined that the costs can be determined fair and reasonable by comparison with similar systems and/or by using previous purchases of these services.

8.   Market Research was limited because AVAYA owns all licenses and copyrights, and for the reasons discussed in paragraphs 4 and 5.

9.  The current configuration using AVAYA is scheduled for review and replacement in the year 2010.  At that time, other technologies will be considered for application and competition.

10.  I certify that the justification for the above request is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; and that the anticipated cost to the Government is fair and reasonable.

<DESC>In support of RAF Alconbury and RAF Upwood, the government intends to award a contract for linen services.  This is a Request for Proposal (RFP) solicitation. There will be no public bid opening. This is a Request for Proposal (RFP), Performance Price Trade-Off (PPTO) solicitation. Award will be based upon Best Value to the Government in accordance with FAR 15 and the terms in the solicitation. This will be awarded unrestricted. The NAICS code for this requirement is 812320.  The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package.  The entire solicitation, including the performance work statement, will be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.   Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package, which should be on or about 19 September 2006 and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package and attachments.  Potential offerors MUST register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ in order to receive notification and/or changes to the solicitation.  All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database or their proposal will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on the Central Contractor registration (CCR) at web site http://www.ccr.gov/ and http://orca.bpn.gov/. Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101 an ombudsman had been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.  The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g. agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>NASA/NSSC has a requirement for a Global Enterprise License which includes a one-time conversation of all individual NASA Center contracts to an Agency Enterprise License Structure to cover 59,093 NASA Community (Civil Service employees and Contractor employees) plus public users, maintenance for the period October 1, 2006 through December 31, 2007 to cover 59,093 NASA Community (Civil Service employees and Contractor employees) plus public users, and annual renewal of the premium support and maintenance agreement for the periods January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2008 and January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009.   NASA/NSSC intends to purchase the Global Enterprise License and support and maintenance from Digital Consulting and Software Services (DCSS), FileNet's authorized representative/partner for FileNet Forms Manager Software, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), ìCompetition Requirementsî, the statutory authority, for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The reasons only one source will be solicited are: 1.  By expanding the Agency license base using FileNet Forms Manager, NASA will be adhering to an existing Agency interoperability standard for intelligent forms as identified in NASA-STD 2809, "NASA intelligent Electronic Forms."  For true Agency interoperability, FileNet Forms Manager is the only solution.   2.  All NASA Centers have implemented FileNet Forms Manager as their standard except NSSC and JPL, which are in the process of evaluating forms software. 3.  The newly created Contract Management Module (CMM) in the Integrated Enterprise Management (IEM) system requires FileNet Forms Manager as part of the Agency IEM process to view FileNet forms used in the Agency Procurement process. 4.  The NASA Automated Award System (NAAS) project has cited Forms Manager as a key element in upgrading future capabilities. 5.  SATERN and several other Agency-Wide services cite Forms Manager as part of the upgrade strategy to allow access to United States Citizens and students as NASA moves in-line with the OMB mandated e-Enablement under the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA). The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 8:30 a.m. local time on September 25, 2006.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517310.

<DESC>RESPONSE DATE IS OCTOBER 31, 2006.

As part of its biodefense research mission, the Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  announces a program to support a systems biology analysis of innate and/or adaptive immune responses to infection, vaccination, or immunotherapy, with a focus on NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens (listed at http://www2.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm). Immunological research that is not directed specifically at one or more NIAID Category A, B, or C priority pathogen or their products is responsive only if the research: 1) addresses a practical approach to inducing, controlling or improving the effectiveness of innate and/or adaptive immune responses to infection by those pathogens or vaccines or immunotherapies to prevent them; and 2) includes validation studies with at least one NIAID Category A, B or C priority pathogen to confirm the importance of the immunological pathway in protection of the host from, or clearance of that pathogen. 

The goal of this program is to develop a more comprehensive knowledge of innate and adaptive immune responses to bacteria and viruses or host responses to vaccines and immunotherapeutics against these pathogens, using a systems biology approach.  Knowledge gained from these studies will advance our understanding of the delicate balance required to induce protective immunity against infectious agents, in particular NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens, without accompanying immune-mediated damage to the individual.

The systems biology analysis shall be based on high-throughput screens of existing or novel mouse models for identification of key regulatory immune response genes, supported by detailed genomics, proteomics, computational biology, and bioinformatics approaches to determine the gene products? functions in innate and/or adaptive immunity to infection with, or vaccination or immunotherapy against, NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens. 

The systems biology analysis shall include:

(1) High-throughput screens of mouse models for identification of key regulatory immune response genes. Forward genetic approaches are preferred for the generation of novel mouse models or study of existing models, since genes can be identified in the absence of a detailed knowledge of the genetic regulation of an observed phenotype. Some recommended genetics approaches include random mutagenesis using ethylnitrosourea (ENU), or large-scale analysis of recombinant inbred strains or congenic animals.  More targeted high-throughput methods (e.g., high-throughput generation of targeted Knock-outs, Knock-ins, or deletion mutations) may be utilized with adequate justification of the benefits these approaches bring to large-scale identification of novel immune response genes; and 

(2) Human correlation studies for analysis of a subset of immune regulatory genes, identified in the mouse studies, in human cell or tissue samples. While human cell lines may be used in initial screens, results shall be validated in primary human cell lines or tissues.  The analyses shall be designed to determine whether the immune response genes identified in the mouse function similarly in human immune cells. 

This RFP will be available electronically on/about June 30, 2006, and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps and the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.     This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.     No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>INDEFINITE DELIVERY, INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) MULTIPLE AWARD CONSTRUCTION MANAGER AS CONSTRUCTOR (CMc) CONTRACT.  The Government may award up to 10 (ten) IDIQ contracts under this solicitation for each of the five geographical areas:  St. Louis, MO, Kansas City, MO, the State of NE, the State of KS, and the State of  IA.  Note that all contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and On-Line Representations & Certifications Application (ORCA).  The website(s) for registration are www.ccr.gov and www.bpn.gov, respectively.  All contractors interested in obtaining a copy of the solicitation must be registered in the FedTeDS system at www.fedteds.gov.  All information about this acquisition, including solicitation and/or amendments, will be distributed solely through www.fedteds.gov.  The procurement will include a wide range of construction projects over the next five (5) year period, utilizing the traditional IDIQ Design-Bid-Build task order contract approach with optional CMc (Construction Manager as Constructor) services.  The CMc solicitation may contain a shared savings clause.  A typical task order could contain some or all of the following:  modifications to architectural components including, but not limited to:  ceilings, walls, floors (including access floor systems), roofing systems, millwork and wall covering.  Work may also include modifications and replacement of mechanical systems to include, but not be limited to:  air handling units, chillers, boilers, ductwork systems and accessories, piping systems (including pumps), HVAC system controls, fire protection sprinkler systems and accessories, and plumbing equipment/accessories.  Work may also include electrical systems including, but not be limited to:  lighting systems, primary and secondary power distribution systems and transformers.  Special competencies will be required on a task order by task order basis for any work involving membrane roofing, asbestos abatement, PCB removal and/or elevator work.  Task orders will be issued utilizing the traditional IDIQ approach or by issuing a CMc task order. GSA defines CMc as a firm that contracts directly with a building owner to provide pre-construction services as well as general construction and construction management services.  The CMc will be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, working with GSA, GSA?s selected A-E firm and other designated GSA consultants.  The CMc will provide professional, technical, administrative and clerical personnel, as needed, to perform all required services to renovate the building, including, but not limited to, those described in this announcement.  It is anticipated that future services of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities, which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs).  The CMc must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project.  In addition, the CMc will be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines, as needed.  Pre-Construction Phase services shall include, but are not limited to, review and evaluation of the concept, design development and construction document submission for constructability, value engineering suggestions, identification of any problems or errors in the design and design documentation, consultation during construction document production, preliminary project schedule development, primary cost estimates during design development and construction documents, and development of subcontractor and supplier interest.  Construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, renovation and conversion of the building in accordance with the specifications, administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, maintaining of construction records including daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, and turnover to designated facility management staff and other required supplemental services as requested by GSA.  The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.  The maximum estimated value (total of the base and all option periods, if exercised) of each contract award as a result of this solicitation is $40,000,000.  It is anticipated that multiple contracts will be awarded to contractors who will be expected to complete both the traditional Design-Bid-Bid IDIQ general contractor duties as well as CMc duties.  The type of task order, traditional IDIQ or CMc, will be determined prior to the issuance of each individual order placed under the base contract.  The period of performance will consist of a twelve (12) month base period and the potential for four (4) additional one year option periods, if exercised by the Government not-to-exceed sixty (60) months.  Each contract awarded will contain a guaranteed minimum amount of $1,000 per year, to be satisfied by the award of one or more task orders.  The Government will reserve their right to award future task orders based on best value and/or price.  The Government will make contract award to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal contains technical and cost features that provide the best overall value to the Government and conforms to the solicitation requirements and applicable regulations by a combination of price, past performance and the evaluation criteria as outlined in the solicitation.  The technical evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.  The technical evaluation factors in descending order of importance are:  past experience (35%), past performance (25%), key personnel (20%), and management and technical approach (20%).  The procurement will be negotiated on a best value basis in accordance with FAR 15.101.  All contractors submitting a proposal that are a large business must provide an acceptable subcontracting plan.   Once approved and eligible for award, the Contractor must submit their subcontracting plan and all required reports through the ESRS system.  The applicable North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS Code) established is 236220, which sets the small business size standard at $31M.  Paper copies of the solicitation will not be made available.  Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon any and all interested parties to review this website frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  The CMc solicitation is scheduled to be uploaded to FedTeDS on or about October 4, 2006.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposal as being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   RFQ N00189-06-T-0337 is issued as a  Request for Quote.   This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12. The FSC is 41, the NAICS code for this requirement is 423730.  The Contracting Department at FISC Norfolk intends to purchase on a full and open competitive basis the following item:  0001, 1 each,  Brand Name or Equal to Trane, 100 Ton, Air Cooled Helical rotary Chiller, Model #RTAA-100.  Salient characteristics:    Replacement chiller that will interface with the existing Johnson Controls Metasys DDC System.  The replacement system   will require a conduit run for the LON wire from chiller to the DDC control panel.   The unit requires 460 volt/60 hertz/3 phase electrical connections.  The unit must comply with efficiency requirements of  ASHRAE Standard 90.1-1999 and CAN/CSA C743-02.   Because of the need for form and fit, the unit shall fit on the existing cement pad that measures 234? x 90? and work in conjunction with the existing 140 Ton Trane Chiller already installed at the facility.  Installation of the unit will include all necessary services to install and interface the unit.  Installation shall also include all materials for piping, wiring of new unit to existing building structures and interface as described, as well as demolition of the old chiller that is being replaced.   

Definition and specifications of LON:  LonWorks is a networking platform specifically created to address the unique performance, reliability, installation, and maintenance needs of control applications. The platform is built on a low bandwidth protocol created by Echelon Corporation for networking devices over media such as twisted pair, powerlines, fiber optics and RE. It is popular for the automation of various functions within buildings such as lightIng and HVAC.

Manufacturers in a variety of industries including building, home, transportation, utility, and industrial automation have adopted the platform as the basis for their product and service offerings. To date, thousands of companies have built products and applications on top of the platform, performing such diverse functions as embedded machine control, municipal and highway street lighting, heating and air conditioning systems, intelligent electricity metering, subway train control, stadium lighting and speaker control, security systems, fire detection and suppression, and newborn location monitoring and alarming.

The platform has its origins with chip designs, power line and twisted pair signaling technology, routers, network management software, and other products from Echelon Corporation. In 1999 the communications protocol (then known as LonTalk) was submitted to ANSI and accepted as a standard for control networking (ANSIJEIA7O9.1-B). Echelon?s power line and twisted pair signaling technology was also submitted to ANSI for standardization and accepted. Since then, ANSI/E1A709. I has been accepted as the basis for IEEE 1473 -L (in-train controls), AAR Electro-pneumatic braking systems for freight trains, IFSF (European petrol station control), SEMI (semiconductor equipment manufacturing), and in January 2005 as prENl49O8 (European building automation, preliminary standard). The protocol is also one of data link/physical layers of the BACnet ASHRAE/ANSJ standard for building automation.

The LonWorks platform also has an affiliated 11, tunneling standard, EIA-852, in use by a number of manufacturers to connect the devices on previously deployed and new LonWorks based networks to IP aware applications or remote network management tools.

The ANSI/EIA7O9. 1 standard document is available from ANSI and reference implementations are available online for porting the protocol to a variety of processors. Alternatively, microchips that have the protocol logic hard-wired in are available from a number of suppliers either as stand-alone integrated circuits (IC) or as a combined integrated circuit/transceiver. In Lonworks these IC?s are known as ?Neurons?.

<DESC>This is a request for information only, as part of a market research study.  There is no solicitation package available.  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst is seeking sources that may be capable of producing the Shaft Engine Test Instrumentation (SETI) System in accordance with a ?Build-To-Print? Level III drawing package. The SETI System is an automated computer-based test, measurement and control system for the purpose of Intermediate testing of aircraft gas turbo-shaft engines in either an indoor or outdoor environment at various military sites.  The requirement would be for a total estimated production quantity of twenty-four (24) units, with the first two (2) units being pre-production units to be used for First Article Testing, and potentially, long-term support.  The unit shall meet the existing SETI drawings and specifications. Due to the costly and time-consuming testing that would be required, the Government will not be entertaining alternate systems in order to satisfy this need. Only the ?Build-To-Print? system is being considered for procurement.  The Government is looking for potential sources for this requirement.  All interested parties should send company and/or descriptive literature along with Completed Survey as well as any comments or questions to Ms. Veronica Anderson, e-mail: veronica.anderson@navy.mil, fax: (732) 323-2359 or address: Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Contracts, Code 25211VAB562-3, Hwy 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5082.

<DESC>This modification revises previously issued FBO notice for solicitation NCI-60188-NG. 

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) plans to procure on a sole source basis in accordance with 13.106-1(b)(1), services regarding: Expanded Evaluation of Gene Expression in the Succeed Study:  Defining Host and HPV Gene Expression Profiles by Specific Cervix Cell Populations and Disease Status, with the University of Wisconsin, 1525 Linden Drive, Madison WI 53706.   

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M. 

The purpose of this requisition is to provide service for optimized laser capture microdissection in cervical tissue, RNA extraction and amplification, and conduct of the Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 human expression array chip.  Services shall be provided for one year from date of award.  The University of Wisconsin at Madison presently constructs an in-house HPV array chip that contains 70-mer oligonucleotide probes for all genes of all 37 sequenced mucosotropic HPV genotypes as well as a few selected host genes.  The chip has been verified and optimized with various known samples including HPV-expressing keratinocyte cell lines (NIHS, W12, CaSKI), oral cancer-driven cell lines, and primary cancer tissue, detection of unintegrated HPB DNA and the ability to add additional probes as desired, such as spliced mRNA junctions.  HPV chip is produced solely by the University of Wisconsin at Madison and the utilization of these assays is critical to the proposed analysis of SUCCEED specimens for host and viral expression, to expand the previous contract MQ-515642 where initial SUCCEED tissue specimens have been evaluated, it is imperative for study validity that the expansion be conducted within the same laboratory using the same assays.

Under the previous contract, 72 specimens from SUCCEED (Study to Understand Cervical Cancer Early Endpoints and Determinants) were evaluated for specimen quality and both host and viral expression.  Based on those analyses, it was determined that data from additional specimens would be necessary for scientifically sound and robust analyses to address our primary scientific objectives.  This requirement is to continue the evaluation, so that we may increase the number of specimens for robust statistical analyses when combined with results from those specimens already evaluated under the previous contract. The expansion of this study is critical to attain a proper sample size for scientifically sound evaluation of primary study results.  Handling of specimens in an identical manner as those handled under the previous contract is mandatory and essential for the scientific integrity of the project.  All data elements obtained under the present contract must also be identical to the data elements obtained under the previous contract for combined analysis.  The specimens under the proposed contract and with those handled in the previous contract can not be handled or evaluated differently if their results are to be combined for analyses.  The same techniques must be applied to all specimens equally in order to obtain standardized and scientifically sound results across all specimens so that results can be evaluated in totality, including that of the in-house HPV array that is only developed at the University of Wisconsin.  Under the previous contract, specimens were analyzed by the in-house HPV array chip that not only contains 70-mer oligonucleotide probes for all genes of all 37 sequenced mucosotropic HPV genotypes, but includes a tailored selection of specific host genes necessary for independent comparison with host array data.  This chip with all 37 sequenced mucosotropic HPV genotyped and the specified host genes is unique to the University of Wisconsin and has importantly been verified and optimized with at least three HPV-expressing keratinocyte cell lines, with an oral cancer-drive cell line, and primary cancer tissue.  Additionally, we required other unique attributes to the chip, including the detection of unintegrated HPV DNA within the array and the ability to add additional probes.  The University of Wisconsin is the only source known to the NCI with this specific HPV chip and the ability to maintain consistency in the study.  

This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party has the unique capabilities, resources and personnel to perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on September 21, 2006.  For further information please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).   Reference NCI-60188-NG.

<DESC>Contracting Office:  Missile Defense Agency, (MDA), Contracts Directorate; 7100 Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC, 20301-7100

Description:  The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is seeking potential sources to provide nationwide marketing and recruiting services for a variety of professional science, engineering, and business disciplines.  MDA is looking for support from an organization that is both knowledgeable of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the federal personnel management hiring process, and is experienced with implementing recruitment programs for attracting qualified applicants.

Background:  The Missile Defense Agency is a separate agency of the DoD under the direction, authority, and control of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics).  The Agency manages, directs, and executes the ballistic missile defense program with the following mission: define, develop and acquire BMD architectures with the systems, subsystems, and components needed to defend the U.S., deployed forces, allies, and friends; employ an integrated system that layers defenses to intercept missiles in all phases of their flight (i.e., boost, midcourse, and terminal) against all ranges of threats; and enable the Military Services to field elements of the overall Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) as soon as practicable.  To achieve this mission, the Agency is developing and testing technologies, using prototype and test assets to provide early capability, and improving the effectiveness of our deployed capabilities by inserting new technologies as they become available or when the threat warrants an accelerated capability.

Requirements:  As a result of this technologically challenging national defense mission, the Agency has an immediate and continuous need for a variety of professional disciplines.  Accordingly, MDA needs to recruit nationwide for qualified applicants in the following occupational job series:

?X	General Engineering and related sub-specialties 
?X	Accounting, Budgeting, and Business Management Specialists
?X	Physical Scientists and related sub-specialties
?X	Information Management and Technology Specialists
?X	Contract Management and Procurement Specialists
?X	Program Managers
?X	Logistics Management Specialists
?X	Program and Management Analysts 

MDA has open and continuous needs for employees interested in the following types of positions:  
?X	Temporary/part-time employment
?X	Internships (available in all professional series)
?X	Mid-level staff (with undergraduate training and less than 10 years experience)
?X	Senior-level staff  (with graduate training and more than 10 years experience)  

Communicating the Agency??s current and future employment needs requires a comprehensive and substantial recruitment program that uses a full spectrum of services to identify potential markets, target audiences, and disseminate information and employment opportunities.  The scope of this program effort should include:

?X	Marketing Research?Xcoordinate, schedule, and facilitate focus groups; conduct interviews; and assess current print and multimedia materials and program strategies.
	
?X	Communications Planning?Xdevelop contemporary communication goals, objectives, and strategies for all target audiences and customers; monitor, measure and evaluate the communication plans and programs?? effectiveness.

The U.S Coast Guard (USCG) has identified a need to equip 46 rotary wing aircraft with capable and supportable Electro-Optical/Infrared Sensor Systems (FSS).  The USCG is publishing this request for information to provide potential suppliers with an opportunity to review and comment on the specification, support contract and objectives.  Supplier FSS proposals will be evaluated for changeability, supportability, performance and life cycle costs.  The supplier will be responsible for insuring performance for the life of the system as defined in the enclosed Coast Guard support by the hour (SBH) document.  A government team has reviewed EO/IR market survey data and Coast Guard operational requirements to develop the enclosed FSS performance specification.  The specification defines desired and required EO/IR capabilities.  Potential suppliers are encouraged to review the enclosed documents and provide written suggestions to the contracting officer.  

1.	Process
The Coast Guard is publishing EO/IR FLIR Sensor Systems (FSS) requirements documentation and will consider suggestions from qualified suppliers.  Suggestions must be received at the address listed below no later than 15 August 2006.  Advance copies may be sent by e-mail to Constance.W.Cox@uscg.mil (the contracting officer) including the following in the subject line °ßFSS Specification Comments, Company Name°®.  Correspondence must include a company point of contact with address, phone number and email address.

The Coast Guard will revise the FSS documents based upon industry comments and publish a solicitation for FSS procurement.   The proposals will be evaluated by a Coast Guard Technical Evaluation Team with concurrent technical review and comment by NWSC Crane.  The target for the initial contract award is 15 November 2006.  The first article(s) will be required for evaluation on or about 15 February 2007.  First article tests will be performed both in the lab at NWSC Crane and in flight tests on Coast Guard aircraft.  Six systems will be procured as soon as possible.  Additional systems will be procured as funding becomes available.

2.	Scope
The FSS may be installed on any DHS aircraft.  The FSS will be installed on aircraft now operating without FLIR and the FSS will replace the FLIR systems currently in service on Coast Guard rotary wing aircraft. The requirement includes life cycle support, the EO/IR FSS system and recording capability.  The recording requirement may be a separate procurement from the FSS.  The support contract is intended for 46 Coast Guard aircraft.  Additional DHS aircraft may added as required.

3.	Background
The Coast Guard currently operates (99) H-65 and (41) H-60 aircraft.  These aircraft require sensor improvements to support Coast Guard°¶s Statutory Mission Requirements (e.g. SAR, MDA, HLS, & ELT).  A requirement for airborne use of force (AUF) capability for Coast Guard helicopters is evolving rapidly.  AUF equipment, including the FSS, will be installed in all H-60 aitory Mission Requirements (e.g. SAR, MDA, HLS, & ELT).  A requirement for airborne use of force (AUF) capability for Coast Guard helicopters is evolving rapidly.  AUF equipment, including the FSS, will be installed in all H-60 aircraft and, initially, a subset of the H-65 fleet.  There is an immediate need to equip six H-65 aircraft for operations in the fall of 2007 to support critical Airborne Use of Force national security requirements.  Current plans call for a minimum of 46 Airborne Use of Force aircraft equipped with FSS. From the point of award forward, FSS systems will be enrolled in a scalable support contract in increments of 10 systems up to an operational fleet of approximately 150 systems. 

The Coast Guard has identified the need to improve on typical industry support plans for FLIR systems.  The Coast Guard has over 20 years of experience with maintenance and repair support by the hour (SBH) for engines and avionics components.  The FSS SBH document was defined based on the successful support by the hour (SBH) agreements currently utilized by the Coast Guard.

<SUBJECT>R -- The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) is seeking a contractor to perform investment and recordkeeping tasks in support of the Court Registry Investment System.

<DESC>The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) is seeking a contractor to perform investment and recordkeeping tasks in support of the Court Registry Investment System (CRIS).  The Court Registry Investment System (CRIS) is a cash management system for court registry funds developed and tested by the Clerk, hereinafter called ?CRIS Fund Manager?, of the United States District Court of the Southern District of Texas (TX-S), which is located in Houston.  The system began operations in 1988.  Currently there are twenty-three participating courts around the country.  As of June 30, 2005, the registry fund total for all federal courts was approximately $3.3 billion of which $1.8 billion was invested in CRIS.  

Securities purchased are normally held until maturity.  Safety of principal and liquidity of investments without sacrificing principal are among the more important objectives of the CRIS.  The Clerk of the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Texas, known as the CRIS Fund Manager, seeks a contractor to assist in developing portfolio strategies to accomplish the objectives of CRIS, to advise on the selection of specific investments, to execute directed securities transactions, and to maintain case-by-case accounting records.

In brief, each week the CRIS Fund Manager is advised of new deposits and planned withdrawals.  The contractor will advise what security transactions, consistent with the CRIS objectives, are appropriate in these instances.  The CRIS Fund Manager will then direct the contractor to buy or sell specific securities.  Securities purchased by the contractor will be transferred to the CRIS account in the Securities Handling Resource-sharing Endeavour (SHARE) system maintained by the Federal Reserve.  Once confirmation of the transfer has been received from the Federal Reserve Bank an immediate payment (deposit) will be recorded in the contractor?s reserve account at the Federal Reserve Bank.  In those rare instances when securities must be sold prior to maturity, funds must be deposited in Treasury?s General Account at the Federal Reserve Bank prior to the securities being transferred from the CRIS account in SHARE.  Because monies remain on deposit with the Treasury and are never in possession of the contractor, there are no collateral requirements.  The contractor will next update individual case records by adding new deposits, subtracting withdrawals and allocating portfolio earnings.  A case investment report will then be mailed to each court member.  Other portfolio information and statistics will be provided to the CRIS Fund Manager on a regular basis.  The solicitation is scheduled to be released on or about March 27, 2006.  The point of contact for this solicitation is Michelle Hupp, Contracting Officer, (202) 502-1574.

8. POSITION DESCRIPTION:


I.  BACKGROUND

Since gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Armenia has been struggling to establish a free market economy and a democratic governance system.  Immediately after independence, Armenia plunged into a humanitarian crisis as it suffered the effects of the conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) region, which lies within Azerbaijan but is occupied by ethnic Armenians, and the subsequent blockade by Turkey.  There is currently a cease-fire but no permanent resolution to the dispute.  Armenia slowly emerged from the humanitarian crisis and has been working on establishing and strengthening the institutions necessary for a free market economy, a democratic governing system, and an adequate social safety net.  Although Armenia has made significant progress on the political, economic and social fronts, there is still much room for improvement and much need for continued international support.

The U.S. Government (USG) assistance program in the Caucasus region as a whole is of particular strategic importance to the U.S. and enjoys high visibility and considerable interest from the public and private sectors alike.  Given the diverse, politically sensitive, and rapidly growing country program, USAID/Armenia became a full-fledged mission in mid-1998, having previously been part of the regional Caucasus mission.  USAID first started its programs in Armenia in 1992, focusing on emergency assistance to the large number of vulnerable persons, including those displaced by the regions? various conflicts.  

The current USAID program focuses increasingly on sustainable development in the governance, social, health, and economics sectors.  The portfolio of assistance activities is extensive, labor intensive, and requires close performance monitoring to ensure that it is having the desired impact.  The health portfolio works to strengthen Armenia?s health system and, ultimately, improve access to adequate and affordable health services.  Programs address areas of health system reform, pharmaceutical management, maternal, child, and reproductive health, eye care, and women?s cancer prevention and detection. Presented below is the results framework for USAID/Armenia?s health strategic objective.


II.  Introduction 

The USAID Mission in Yerevan has program responsibility for the formulation of the
Country strategy and implementation of a program designed to create a democratic society and market economy in Armenia. The Democracy and Social Reform Office (DSRO) is currently responsible for managing over 30 activities in these program areas, with a budget of approximately $30 million annually.  The DSRO portfolio is large, complex and can be divided into four major components:

	1.  In democracy, USAID Armenia?s goal is increased participation in civic life and more open governance institutions through which to channel participation, in order to stimulate the demand side for improved governance and to hold government institutions accountable through the democratic process.

	2.  In healthcare, USAID Armenia programs focus on primary healthcare, and a well-functioning health system that increases utilization of high quality services.  These factors are critical if Armenia is to break out of the vicious cycle of poverty, poor health, and low economic growth.

	3.  In social protection, USAID Armenia?s goal is an effective and sustainable benefits system, in addition to targeted vocational training.  Together, these are necessary to meet long-term universal coverage commitments for the disabled and the elderly, as well as the short-term needs of the unemployed and the poor.

	4.  In Nagorno-Karabakh (NK), USAID provides subsistence level humanitarian assistance to victims of the NK conflict based on the needs of these victims and in response to U.S. Congressional directives.  Humanitarian aid provided since 1998 is in the areas of shelter, health, drinking and irrigation water systems, de-mining and micro-loans to selected vulnerable population of NK.

DSRO must, to varying degrees, coordinate each of these activities with a large group of multilateral donors.  These include the World Bank (WB), World Health Organization, UNICEF, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and United Nations Development Program (UNDP), among others. 

Political instability in the government and frequent changes in key counterparts complicate implementation of the DSRO portfolio.  Additionally, many key counterparts have been educated in the former Soviet system and have had limited international experience or are not up to date in their fields of specialization.  

The Health SO core team currently includes two US technical advisors and one FSN (FSN- 11). DSRO is currently recruiting for another FSN 11 Health Project Management Specialist, Funding for USAID/Armenia?s Health activities totals approximately $8 million per year.  On a day-to-day basis, the DSRO USPSC/TCN Health Advisor will be responsible for designing, managing, implementing, coordinating, and monitoring major components of the Mission?s health sector portfolio.  The Health Advisor will receive guidance from the Senior US technical advisor and will be supervised by the DSRO Director.  He/she is expected to work independently, use good judgment and make decisions regarding USAID?s health sector portfolio as specified in this scope of work (SOW).  The incumbent will have the authority to negotiate on behalf of the Mission regarding the health sector portfolio.  

III.	Duties and Responsibilities

The Health Advisor will serve as advisor and program manager for the Mission?s health sector portfolio that is designed to achieve the Mission?s Strategic Objective 3.2 ?Increased Utilization of Sustainable, High-Quality Primary Healthcare (PHC) Services.? The portfolio currently includes the Mission?s flagship Primary Healthcare Reform Project (PHCR), a large reproductive health project (NOVA), a mobile medical outreach program, two discrete GDA projects and some field support activities (Demographic and Health Survey, Rational Pharmaceutical Management Plus).  The incumbent will be assigned as cognizant technical officer (CTO) responsibilities for several of these activities depending on prevailing DSRO management needs.  Program implementation includes working with both governmental and non-governmental agencies in order to achieve program objectives.

In performing his/her duties, the incumbent will be expected to coordinate with mid and high level Armenian government officials, other donors, and local and international non-governmental organizations to achieve program objectives.

<DESC>Brookhaven Science Associates plans to acquire a Nanoimprinting tool for the Nanopatterning Laboratory of the Center for Functional Nanomaterials (CFN) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.   This device will offer an alternative to traditional optical lithography.  Optical lithography mask plates are replaced by templates that directly transfer the pattern on to a polymer-coated substrate such as a silicon wafer using thermal embossing or embossing followed by UV exposure and curing at moderate temperatures. 

Vendors must supply detailed descriptions and dimensioned layout drawings of the Nanoimprinter, the materials used in its construction, failure rate data and, where applicable, manufacturer?s specifications of subsystems so BSA can evaluate quality of construction.  The primary components will be rated for operational reliability, construction quality, and cost.  Benchmark specifications are quoted in the following text. The Nanoimprinter will be evaluated on how well it meets or exceeds the operational benchmarks.  Where appropriate, the vendor must provide a numerical specification describing the benchmark for each listed item.  For each benchmark, vendors must describe how their process approaches, meets, or exceeds the listed criteria and provide a reasonable amount of detail concerning exposure parameters, development chemistry, and exposure speed per given substrate area.  BSA reserves the right to submit samples to the vendor's application laboratory and evaluate the results with its own equipment.

The following factors, in their relative order of weighting, will be utilized to evaluate the offers:


Technical Specifications:
Submit operating specifications for the proposed Nanoimprinting system utilizing the same format (Section and Sub-Section numbering) presented by the specifications contained in the solicitation.

In addition to the technical benchmarks, vendors will also be evaluated on the following performance and support criteria.

Performance Risk: Submit references, points of contact and telephone numbers for all installations of Nanoimpriters or similar systems for the last 3 years.  

 System Support:  Provide/discuss as applicable the following:
1. Operating Manuals
2. Warranty
3. Service Contract
4. Spare Parts List
5. Training

<OFFADD>Bureau of Reclamation - Upper Columbia Area Office 1917 Marsh Road Yakima  WA 98901
<SUBJECT>B--Museum Assessment
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation's Upper Columbia Area  Office (Reclamation) intends to negotiate a sole-source contract for special studies and analyses service to complete a museum assessment with The Burke Museum, University of Washington. Museum property is a class of  reportable and accountable federal assets that requires an assessment to understand its value and potential investment in order to maintain the property for public benefit.  The Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Region, is undertaking a pilot project to assess one collection already housed at the Burke Museum to better understand professional assessments of museum property collections for the long term impacts or implications to the agency-wide property management program.   The Keechelus collection is Bureau of Reclamation museum property obtained from an archeological excavation of the historic construction camp for Keechelus Dam.  The collection consists of 6393 separate items, organized into 1580 catalog numbers.  As an archeological collection from an early 20th century historic occupation, the majority of the artifacts are discards from the normal activities of camp life, and includes predominantly fragmentary remains of a wide variety of domestic and industrial items, such as clothing, shoes, metal, glassware, dishes and similar kitchenware, medicine bottles, personal hygiene, tack, and construction materials (window glass, nails, and similar hardware).  Viewed in its entirety as a representative sample of the debris of early 20th century camp life, the collection's value is primarily to research; there are few, if any, "museum quality" artifacts amenable to the art or collector's markets. Most, if not all, of the Keechelus collection will be either rated Good or Fair.  In addition Good or Fair presumes the item is in a relatively stable state of preservation.  Poor is applied to a relatively high value item(s) in need of specialized conservation treatments beyond the ability a stable storage environment could not provide. Proposed service will require: 1. Expanding existing catalog by the necessary data fields to incorporate the observations made on each item: a.  fragmentary or whole specimen b.  condition (good, fair, poor) c.  security tag number 2. Use professional judgement  to repackage collection in order to enhance artifact stability in its storage environment.  For example, remove items from polyetheline bags and place in open trays together with supportive padding if necessary to prevent breakage from stress or normal handling, or to provide necessary ventilation. 3. Count and weigh bags instead of separate items/specimens.  Record bag weight with the items included.   4. Separate and consolidate the collection by material type, and store items of the same or similar material type together. 5. Secure storage boxes with security tags; record tag numbers in catalog. Deliverables: 1. Revised and updated collections catalog to include specification #3, above. 2.  A report describing: a.  the work completed relative to the specifications listed above; b. technical problems encountered and how they were resolved; c.  if difficulties were encountered whose resolution were outside the scope, recommend a treatment or further course of action, if warranted. d.  a professional assessment of the overall condition, noting, for example, proportions of good, fair and poor items; opinion as to the stability of the whole collection in its storage environment, and if the assessment appreciably enhanced the long-term stability of the collection; items in immediate need of conservation treatments; items that will likely need conservation treatments in the near future, for example within 10 years; the value of the collection when viewed as a whole, for example, as research in experimental conservation treatments, research on early 20th century material culture, research in museum disaster scenarios, or in exhibits or displays. Performance Period: October 1, 2006 through March 1, 2007 Sole Source Justification The Burke Museum has been storing the collection under an annual purchase order since 2003 and the Burke has already expressed a willingness and capability to perform the assessment to benefit both their students, and Reclamation's desire for quick turn-around in order to accommodate a GRPA reporting goal for 2007.  Because of our existing storage procurement with the Burke, the museum has coincidentally scheduled a review of the storage conditions that would include some of the tasks involved in a museum assessment.   The cost to relocate the collection to another vendor for this service, and then back to the Burke to continue the long-term storage arrangement would add significantly to the overall cost of this museum assessment.   The cost to temporarily relocate then return the collection to another vendor in a 300- mile radius of Seattle has also been determined to be a burden cost to the project. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(2)(B)(C)ii(A)(B) This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties that are certain they can meet the requirement must submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  All proposals received within 7 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by Reclamation. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by Reclamation not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of Reclamation.  Written proposals may be submitted to Connie Morgan via fax to 509-454-5615 or electronically at cmorgan.usbr.gov no later than close of business 9-25-06 Technical questions should be sent to  Mark DeLeon, Area Archeologist Upper Columbia Area Office, desk:	509-575-5848 extension 320,  fax: 509-454-5650,  email: mdeleon@pn.usbr.gov

The scarlet uniform coast which is authorized for use by the United States Marine Drum & Bugle Corps is a unique uniform requirement requiring tenured knowledge from an experienced vendor.  Awarding this contract to a vendor unfamiliar with military uniforms requires sample coats and testing of wear capabilities.  Consistency in manufacturing a customized uniform is key in maintaining quality workmanship and !  identical appearance.  Each coat maintains a productive life cycle of three to eight years.  To maintain visual continuity, the sizes, colors and overall production needs to be consistent in order to allow new shipments to blend in with current coast.  Replacement collars require the same cloth, styling, and workmanship as the coats in order to maintain visual continuity and easae of replacement by the local tailor.  Director's coasts for Drum and Bugle Officers and Drum Majors require the same attention to detail and cannot be from separate sources.  Aura-Shield Inc., has a proven ability for textile contracts, maintaining uniform specifications, and is a specialist in the making and fitting of military uniforms, they have been an effective source of proven workmanship.  Aura-Shield Inc., is a small business.     The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns.

<SUBJECT>59 -- Trimble R7 Base and Rover GPS Kit - ISP
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to solicit and negotiate a sole-source award with Marinel Inc for Trimble R7 Base and Rover GPS Kits- ISP.  MacDill AFB Contracting intends to issue a purchase order to Marinel Inc under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(b)(i) unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities.

This is a Brand Name and Sole Source justification based on the requirement to purchase identical previously purchased equipment.  This equipment is on the Program?s approved Basis of Issue (BOI).  The current Mission Familiarization Virtual Reality (MFVR) software used by this program for Survey missions requires special software code written to allow the GPS and its components  to properly function and communicate with the MFVR software.  The communication and diagnostic test code software took six (6) months to develop at a cost of over 150K.  Based on this investment in time, effort, and funds, the Trimble R7 Base and Rover GPS Kit is required.  

The request to use the same Vendor is due to the time, effort, and funds required by this program to teach the Vendors local based technicians how to test the equipment when it is utilized with the MFVR software.  Cost to the program to teach and maintain technical requirements with this local Vendor over the past Eight months is in excess of 50K to date.  

Once this equipment is setup with the MFVR software, it can not be sent directly back to the manufacturer due to the manipulation and integration of the equipment, software, and software code.  On all but one occasion, the faults within the equipment were associated with the interface between the equipment and the software.  If a different vendor is required, there will be an additional requirement and cost to train their technicians at their facility on how to use our system in relation to the equipment.  The current vendor is only 15 minutes from this installation, and provides assistance 24/7 within a 6 hour notification.   The amount of time, effort, and funds to change brand names and companies will exceed 200K. CLINs:

<SUBJECT>16 -- FLIR/FSS/EO-IR Specification and Support By The Hour document, Request for Comments
<DESC>This is a Request for Comments and Information notice.  The US Coast Guard, ARSC, EISD, Elizabeth City NC is seeking vendor comments on a proposed solicitation document including Support By the Hour, specifications and a general project summary.  The Support By the Hour document and Specifications are posted on the public USCG website at www.uscg.mil/HQ/arsc/solicitations.htm   Then scroll down to the EISD contracting page to HSCG38-06-RFI-EISD007.  Comments/questions/expressions of interest in this acquisition should be directed to Constance W. Cox, Contracting Officer, tele 252 335-6895, e-mail Constance.W.Cox@uscg.mil or FAX 252 335-6463.  First cutoff date for comments will be 15 August 2006.  While comments are not required for participation in the subsequent solicitation (estimated to be published within the next 60 days), comments from FSS/FLIR OEMS will be welcomed and considered.

The U.S Coast Guard (USCG) has identified a need to equip up to 150 rotary wing aircraft with capable and supportable Electro-Optical/Infrared Sensor Systems (FSS).  The USCG is publishing this request for information to provide potential suppliers with an opportunity to review and comment on the specification, support contract and objectives.  Supplier FSS proposals will be evaluated for changeability, supportability, performance and life cycle costs.  The supplier will be responsible for insuring performance for the life of the system as defined in the enclosed Coast Guard support by the hour (SBH) document.  A government team has reviewed EO/IR market survey data and Coast Guard operational requirements to develop the enclosed FSS performance specification.  The specification defines desired and required EO/IR capabilities.  Potential suppliers are encouraged to review the enclosed documents and provide written suggestions to the contracting officer.  A request for proposals for FSS will be issued on or about 15 September 2006.  

1.	Process
The Coast Guard is publishing EO/IR FLIR Sensor Systems (FSS) requirements documentation and will consider suggestions from qualified suppliers.  Suggestions must be received at the address listed below no later than 15 August 2006.  Advance copies may be sent by e-mail to Constance.W.Cox@uscg.mil (the contracting officer) including the following in the subject line °ßFSS Specification Comments, Company Name°®.  Correspondence must include a company point of contact with address, phone number and email address.

The Coast Guard will revise the FSS documents based upon industry comments and publish a solicitation for FSS procurement.  Proposals will be required on or about 15 September 2006.  The proposals will be evaluated by a Coast Guard Technical Evaluation Team with concurrent technical review and comment by NWSC Crane.  The target for the initial contract award is 15 November 2006.  The first article(s) will be required for evaluation on or about 15 February 2007.  First article tests will be performed both in the lab at NWSC Crane and in flight tests on Coast Guard aircraft.  Six systems will be procured as soon as possible.  Additional systems will be procured as funding becomes available.

2.	Scope
The FSS may be installed on any DHS aircraft.  The FSS will be installed on aircraft now operating without FLIR and the FSS will replace the FLIR systems currently in service on Coast Guard rotary wing aircraft. The requirement includes life cycle support, the EO/IR FSS system and recording capability.  The recording requirement may be a separate procurement from the FSS.  The support contract is intended for 150 Coast Guard aircraft.  Additional DHS aircraft may added as required.

3.	Background
The Coast Guard currently operates (99) H-65 and (41) H-60 aircraft.  These aircraft require sensor improvements to support Coast Guard°¶s Statutory Mission Requirements (e.g. SAR, MDA, HLS, & ELT).  A requirement for airborne use of force (AUF) capability for Coast Guard helicopters is evolving rapidly.  AUF equipment, including the FSS, will be installed in all H-60 aircraft and, initially, a subset of the H-65 fleet.  There is an immediate need to equip six H-65 aircraft for operations in the fall of 2007 to support critical Airborne Use of Force national security requirements.  Current plans call for a minimum of 46 Airborne Use of Force aircraft equipped with FSS. From the point of award forward, FSS systems will be enrolled in a scalable support contract in increments of 10 systems up to an operational fleet of approximately 150 systems. 

The Coast Guard has identified the need to improve on typical industry support plans for FLIR systems.  The Coast Guard has over 20 years of experience with maintenance and repair support by the hour (SBH) for engines and avionics components.  The FSS SBH document was defined based on the successful support by the hour (SBH) agreements currently utilized by the Coast Guard.

4.	Objectives

4.1	Support
The Coast Guard support requirements are defined in the attached Support By the Hour (SBH) document.  Coast Guard aircraft operate in a demanding environment.  SBH is intended to insure the FSS is supported in the Coast Guard operating environment.  SBH is intended to align the supplier and Coast Guard interests to provide fully mission capable systems available for Coast Guard operations.  The supplier is responsible for the performance of their product.  SBH provides a framework for the Coast Guard and supplier partnership for the life of the FSS.  The Coast Guard will consider suggestions for modifications to the SBH plan.  Suppliers will be allowed to offer alternative support plans.  However, at a minimum pricing must be provided for the Coast Guard defined SBH.  Evaluation of suppliers will be based on life cycle costs derived from the Coast Guard SBH.

4.2	Performance
The Coast Guard FSS requirements are defined in the attached FLIR Sensor System (FSS) performance Specification.  Additional information is provided below for the key performance parameters.
	
4.2.1	Compatibility
The FSS must be capable of full integration with the aircraft to minimize impacts associated with weight, ground clearance, cabin space, and avoid safety issues such as emergency egress and hard landings.  The system must provide for ergonomic human interfaces compatible with aircrew personnel, procedures, equipment, and proficiency capabilities.  The FSS lighting, displays, controls and indicators shall be optimized for viewing with the unaided eye and compatible with aircrew Night Vision Goggle (NVG) operations.  The system must be have the capability to point and maintain sensor line-of-sight to a known or designated position.  The point command and data shall be capable of interface with a digital map system, Radar, CDU, Heads Up Display with Line of Sight (HUD/LOS) capability for turret control and/or video storage/datalink systems.

4.2.2	Identification
The primary technical performance evaluation standard will be the ability to read 6°® letters during nighttime operations from in excess of 1 nautical mile.

1. BACKGROUND - The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerates the prototyping and deployment of technologies that reduce homeland vulnerabilities.  S&T performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, and universities.  With terrorist events such as the Madrid rail bombing, the London Underground attack, and the recent exposure of possible attacks on U.S. bound flights from the United Kingdom, there is an urgent operational need for a unified approach to the detection of liquid explosives in the civil aviation industry as well as other mass transit modes of transportation.  This project is in support of the ongoing effort by S&T to counter the recent increase from liquid explosives threat.  S&T's goal is to investigate any and all potential detection technologies capable of detecting and distinguishing explosives and flammable liquids from benign liquids (drinks, lotions, hygiene products, contact lens solutions, etc.).  Homemade Explosives (HME) such as black powder, triacetonetriperoxide (TATP), hexamethylene-triperoxidediamine (HMTD), chlorates, and perchlorates mixed with sugar or other fuels have come to be used instead of commercial explosives.  In support of this critical focus area, S&T is initiating the Home Made Explosives (HME) Detection System Development Program. Its goals are: To immediately evaluate Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems capable of detecting Home Made Explosives (HME); To develop, rapidly prototype, and improve products and systems capable of detecting HMEs; To support the research and development of next generation, novel technologies, algorithms or prototypes for the detection of HMEs; To address potential operational venues, including airport and mass transit checkpoints for passengers and carryon baggage (not cargo or checked baggage).  This BAA consists of four Technical Topic Areas (TTAs) with multi-phased program approaches described in Section 2.4.  The BAA is structured to solicit Proposals for the immediate evaluation of projects (TTA-1) where COTS are to be evaluated within 3 to 6 months after award.  Proposals are also to be solicited to develop and improve products in the Prototype or Breadboard stage (TTA-2).  It is anticipated that prototypes will be ready for developmental testing under TTA-2 no later than 30 months after award.  In addition, proposals will be solicited to support the research and development of the next generation or novel technologies in an immature stage of development (TTA-3).  It is anticipated that these technologies will be ready for prototype developmental testing no later than 48 months after award.  The final Proposal solicitation will be for innovative algorithms and data analysis tools to support current COTS and prototypes under development (TTA-4).  It is anticipated that algorithms and data analysis tools will be ready for hosting and testing on selected HME platforms within 24 months after award.
1.1  Program Description - The Home Made Explosives Detection Program will require current technology, and/or innovative or novel capabilities in multiple disciplines including material science, computer science, chemistry, physics, electrical, mechanical and systems engineering.  In order to best accomplish these goals, S&T anticipates receiving proposals with innovative teaming that may include private sector organizations, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and academic institutions.  DOE National Laboratories are precluded from participating in this BAA and any potential R&D efforts by the National labs will be funded separately by S&T.  TTA-4 is intended to encourage small companies and academic institutions with innovative ideas for advanced algorithms and data analysis tools that could be hosted on COTS or near COTS systems.  Coordination and potential teaming is encouraged between algorithm developers and hardware or system developers in Phase II of the TTA-4 projects to demonstrate the proposed capability.
2. PROGRAM APPROACH AND SCHEDULE - The approach and schedule ensures that HME detection technologies will be in place in a timely manner to be effective against indiscriminate threats and new innovative technologies will be researched to further the Nation?s safety.  S&T anticipates making multiple awards under this solicitation.  Small companies and academic institutions with innovative detection technologies or advanced analysis algorithms are encouraged to propose efforts under the most appropriate TTA.  Coordination and potential teaming between hardware or system developers and algorithm developers is encouraged in the Phase II efforts.  2.1 Government Furnished Equipment and Resources - In support of the TTAs, the Government will consider requests for Government furnished resources and technologies.  As part of this solicitation S&T will not publish a list of potentially applicable technologies for accelerated schedule Proposals.  2.2 Review Panel - A review panel drawn from Government and non-Government experts who have signed appropriate non-disclosure agreements will perform technical evaluations or assessments of the proposed efforts.  2.3 Test and Evaluation Facilities - Department of Homeland Security Science & Technology Directorate will make available appropriate test and evaluation facilities to support this program.  Bidders must note any specific requirements required for test and evaluation (T&E) of proposed concepts in their proposal.  Due to the nature of the material being tested and safety concerns, T&E activities will be conducted by trained personnel per S&T' direction.  It will be the responsibility of the selected performers to setup, maintain, and train S&T directed test personnel on the selected systems.  2.4 Program Structure and Program Schedule - The BAA consists of four Technical Topic Areas (TTAs), described below. Responses to TTA-1 should propose immediate (3-6 month) solutions, TTA-2 should provide near term (6-30 month) solutions, TTA-3 should provide long term (30-48 month) developmental solutions, whereas those to TTA-4 should describe algorithm and data analysis technology for the immediate and near term solutions for testing within 24 months.  All responses to TTA-2, TTA-3, and TTA-4 should describe multi-phased efforts, offering clear points for decisions about whether proceeding to the next phase is technically justified.  Performance enhancements that should be strongly considered include increased probability of detection, reduced false alarm rate or automated determinations to aid screener decision making.  Continuation of work past Phase I will also be based upon the availability of funds, potential teaming arrangements and other programmatic considerations as determined by S&T.  
TTA-1: Provide immediately available Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems capable of detecting Home Made Explosives (HME) suitable for checkpoint use in Airports and other Mass Transit facilities.  These systems must be ready for immediate test and evaluation at various facilities, as specified by DHS S&T.  
TTA-2: Provide COTS or Prototype technologies and/or systems that with minor hardware improvements or innovative algorithms and data analysis tools that will significantly improve performance and total cost of ownership of COTS detection systems for HME materials and containers at the checkpoint for passengers and carryon baggage.  The Government anticipates that these efforts will be structured in two phases and will result in fabrication of a prototype system meeting or exceeding most of the goals and Concept-of-Operations (CONOPS) coordinated with TSA prior to completion of Phase I:  Phase I Primary Deliverables:  Successful Critical Design Review (CDR) and performance predictions with supporting data for the prototype system.  Phase II Primary Deliverables: Prototype system ready for T&E in 6-30 months after award of Phase I, Test plan for developmental T&E approved by the Government.  TTA-3: Develop novel or innovative technologies and/or systems to provide significant improvements in the performance and total cost of ownership compared to current technologies or those being developed in projects addressing TTA-1 and TTA-2 requirements.  The Government anticipates that these efforts will be structured in two phases and will result in fabrication of a prototype, system meeting or exceeding most of the goals for the selected applications.  CONOPS must be coordinated with TSA prior to completion of Phase I:  Phase I Primary Deliverables: Successful CDR and performance predictions with supporting data for the prototype system. Phase II Primary Deliverables: Prototype system ready for T&E in 30-48 months after award of Phase I, test plan for developmental T&E approved by the Government.  TTA-4: Provide immediate, developmental or innovative algorithms and data analysis tools that will significantly improve performance and total cost of ownership of COTS detection systems for HME materials and containers at the checkpoint for passengers and carryon baggage.  It is anticipated that these efforts will be structured in two phases and will culminate in a software package ready for developmental testing in selected HME detection platforms proposed by the vendor:  Phase I Primary Deliverables: Feasibility analysis, performance predictions with supporting data for the modified systems.  Completed teaming arrangements with hardware or system developers.  Phase II Primary Deliverables: Software package ready for T&E in 24 months after award of Phase I, Test plan for developmental T&E approved by the Government.  Figure 1. A notional schedule of the program execution timeline.  Offerors are encouraged to propose their own schedule based upon their detailed understanding of the technical challenges and their realistic estimate of the technical effort required to solve the problem they propose.  Projects addressing each of the TTAs must include: contractor performed lab tests, developmental test and evaluation tasks, and, where appropriate, operational user-oriented field tests.  3. OBJECTIVES AND GOALS, 3.1 Preliminary Requirements - There are a number of operational requirements that need to be addressed when evaluating technologies for potential deployment. Below is a list of preliminary requirements that will be refined or clarified by TSA with respect to their future operations.  It is assumed that unopened containers for primary screening will be the standard, and that opening containers may be a potential approach for secondary screening to clear alarms from primary screening.  A threat/no threat response will be satisfactory for primary screening (no threat meaning that this item contains a substance that is recognized to be a typical stream of commerce substance, and a threat designation represents something outside that definition).  It is recognized that some techniques provide higher quality chemical identification than others (with concurrent disadvantages in other areas).  A probability of detection (Pd) objective will be >0.90 and a false alarm rate (FAR) <0.05.  However, much higher Pds and much lower FARs are desired and preference will be given to proposals that realistically project these improved rates.  The throughput objective is no fewer than five people per minute or 10 packages/items per minute.  Total time includes entry and exit of portal or checkpoint, analysis, and results.  Consumables (e.g., filters, reactive agents, batteries) required for operation and routine maintenance of the production system (if any) should be minimal, and should not exceed 5% of the unit cost per year of routine operations.  The production system should not require extensive factory level maintenance.  If factory level maintenance is required, it must not normally be required at a greater frequency than one time every three years, and should not cost over 10% of the total unit cost.  The system must be designed so it is sufficiently easy to operate such that security personnel following initial training (not to exceed 12 hours) can safely and effectively operate the system.  Safety standards:  Must meet appropriate safety standards for safe operation, Must meet Hazards and Electronic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) safety standards, Must be intrinsically safe per Underwriters Laboratory (UL) 913, Any field calibration, if required, must be accomplished within the setup time (or separately during routine maintenance) without any specialized instrumentation, Powered using standard U.S. power requirements (Selectable 115 VAC 60 Hz or 220 VAC 60 Hz), or where appropriate, batteries (e.g., off the shelf 9V, C, or AA and/or rechargeable versions), All proposed concepts and designs must be appropriate for indoor and/or outdoor applications, must be benign to humans and property in the interrogated area, and eventually must be cost-effective to procure and maintain.  Depending on the concept design and application, the devices should have the potential to be portable, transportable, or moveable between inspection sites.  Deliverables, depending on the TTA level shall include a COTS or prototype device and an operator?s manual, suitable for dissemination to law enforcement or security professionals, which includes maintenance procedures and a recommended operational employment protocol.
3.2 Technical Topic Areas - The objectives and goals of each TTA emphasize specific phases of readiness of technologies, systems and algorithms in the detection of HMEs.  The TTA topics are detailed below:  TTA-1: Immediate Need - Provide immediately available Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems capable of detecting Home Made Explosives (HME) suitable for checkpoint use in Airports and other Mass Transit facilities.  These systems must be ready for immediate test and evaluation at various facilities, as specified by DHS S&T.  TTA-2: Near Term Need - Provide COTS or Prototype technologies and/or systems that with minor hardware improvements or innovative algorithms and data analysis tools that will significantly improve performance and total cost of ownership of COTS detection systems for HME materials and containers at the checkpoint for passengers and carryon baggage.  We anticipate that these efforts will be structured in two phases and will result in fabrication of a prototype system meeting or exceeding most of the goals and CONOPS coordinated with TSA prior to completion of Phase I.
TTA-3: Long Term Need - Develop novel or innovative technologies and/or systems to provide significant improvements in the performance and total cost of ownership compared to current technologies or those being developed in projects addressing TTA-1 and TTA-2 requirements.  We anticipate that these efforts will be structured in two phases and will result in fabrication of a prototype system meeting or exceeding most of the goals for the selected applications.  CONOPS must be coordinated with TSA prior to completion of Phase I.  TTA-4: Algorithm Need - Provide immediate, developmental or innovative algorithms and data analysis tools that will significantly improve performance and total cost of ownership of COTS detection systems (including currently deployed systems) for HME materials and containers at the checkpoint for passengers and carryon baggage.  It is anticipated that these efforts will be structured in two phases and will culminate in a software package ready for developmental testing in selected HME detection platforms proposed by the vendor.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-12, Defense Change Notice (DCN) 20060808 and Air Force Acquisition Circular (AFAC) 2006-0515, and can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.  The NAICS code is 923120.  The Bid Schedule shall be for: 
ITEM NO. 0001: Non-personal recurring services to provide Lab tests to the 31st medical group in accordance with the attached Performance Work Statement (Attachment 2, consisting of 7 pages).  THE PRICE WILL BE INSERTED ON THE SCHEDULE (Attachment 1, consisting of 9 pages). The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (Oct 2003) FAR 52.212-1 INSTRUCTION TO OFFERORS?COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Jan 2006), FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Jan 1999) (a)  The Government will select the best overall offer based on a comparative assessment of Price and Past Performance, whereby price may be traded off for past performance.  The following factors will be used to evaluate offers (1) Technical Competency (2) Past Performance (3) Price:  ADDENDUM to 52.212-2:   BASIS FOR AWARD:  This is a competitive, best value acquisition for which competing offerors? past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost or price.  This is a Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) source selection, conducted in accordance with Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.101-1.  By submission of its offer, in accordance with the instructions provided in FAR provision 52.212-1, the offeror accedes to the terms of this contract and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records.  In order for an offer to result in an awardable contract, it must meet the technical requirements, conform to all required terms and conditions, to include resume? all certifications verifying conformance with Italian Laws & Regulations specific to this type of service.  The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: Technical Competency:  The Government?s technical evaluation team shall evaluate each offer by verifying that it contains the relevant proof of accreditation from the College of American Pathologists (CAP) AND Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) (Attach certificates to your offer): (1) Only offers rated technically acceptable will be considered for further evaluation.  Past Performance Evaluation: In order for the Government team to evaluate this factor, the offeror must return the Past Performance questionnaire, Attachment 3, consisting of 3 pages, which will contain three (3) performance references completed on this form.  The performance references will consist of companies for which the offeror has recently performed work.  References must be of comparable magnitude and similar in nature to the work required under this solicitation. Past Performance Evaluation will be rated as follows:  Exceptional:  Indicates that the offeror?s qualifications are clearly superior to that which would normally be found in the international commercial marketplace.  The offeror?s past performance record is so fundamentally sound that there is no doubt in the offeror?s ability to perform the requirement. Very Good:  Indicates that the offeror?s qualifications are above industry standards that would normally be found in the international commercial marketplace.  The offeror?s past performance record presents little doubt of the offeror?s ability to perform the requirement. Satisfactory/Neutral: Based on the offeror?s performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort or no past performance record is available. .Marginal: Indicates that the offeror?s qualifications are below industry standards that would normally be found in the international commercial marketplace.  The offeror?s past performance record presents significant doubt in the offeror?s ability to perform the requirement indicating a medium level of performance risk.  Unsatisfactory:  Indicates that the offeror?s qualifications are clearly inferior to that which would normally be found in the international commercial marketplace.  The offeror?s past performance record is so fundamentally flawed that there is no doubt in the offeror?s inability to perform the requirement indicating a high level of performance risk.  Price Evaluation Factor: For award purposes, the offeror will be evaluated on the TOTAL price of all CLIN(S), contained in the Schedule (Attachment 1).  All offers must include prices for all line item(s).  Failure to include all price(s) will exclude the offer from further consideration for award.  Evaluation process:  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer constitutes the best value to the Government.  Best value will be determined based on an integrated assessment of each quote in terms of Technical Competency, Past Performance and Price.  Therefore, subjective judgment by the government is implicit in the evaluation process. Prices/Options:  The contracting officer will verify any mathematic extensions of prices submitted and then rank offers by prices, including option prices.  An offeror?s proposed price will be determined by multiplying the quantity of months by the proposed monthly rate to confirm the lump sum of each line item.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors; however, it reserves the right to conduct discussions, if deemed in its best interest.

The ADC Branch collects and digitally preserves nonrecord, reference, chronicle of tenure material and preserves information as records, paper files and electronically documenting the transaction of Government business; process Freedom of Information Act requests for official documents; manages and operates an automated document control system for recording and tracking suspense actions and producing correspondence reports; manages and operates an automated document control system to file, track, search and retrieve correspondence.  The ADC will use the two electrically driven vertical, carousel filing systems (commonly referred to as ?Lektriever?) for secure storage, daily filing, and research and retrieval actions of official documents.   2.0. Scope of Work ? 2.1. Lektriever Dismantle and Removal:  Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, transportation and supervision necessary to dismantle and remove of two Kardex Lektriever-type filing systems each with 16 carriages (filing shelves).  Both Kardex Lektriever-type filing systems are in room 3E1016 in the Pentagon.  Room 3E1016 is a ?swing space? office as ADC waits to move to a renovated area.   Once removed, these filing systems will not be used by ESD.  Both Kardex Lektriever-type filing systems are 8.5 feet wide, 5 feet deep (with extended work counter), and 9.3 feet high.  Date for dismantling and removal of both Kardex Lektriever-type filing systems is based on a date which will coincide with the completion of the renovated space and the scheduled move date for ESD.  As of now, there is only a 60-day window, January 1st through February 29th, 2007, when the renovated space will be ready for occupancy.

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesterís concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencyís goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

OTHER CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS 

CONTRACT SECURITY INVESTIGATIVE REQUIREMENT: The employees of the contractor entering the institution shall meet certain security requirements to receive an institutional pass as required by Bureau of Prisons Program Statement 3000.02 dated March 10, 1994. Primary concerns are the amount of contact that may occur between the Contractor and his/her employees with the inmate population during the performance of the contract. 
The program manager at the FCC Beaumont is responsible for conducting the appropriate vouchering, law enforcement checks, and ensuring that fingerprinting is completed on all Contractor staff that may need access inside the confines of the secure perimeter. The personnel department will establish a security file that will be maintained on each of the contractor's employees from the beginning of the contract through its duration. The following investigative procedures will be performed:

National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check;
DOJ-99 (name check);
FD-258 (fingerprint check):
Law Enforcement Agency checks;
Vouchering of Employers;
Resume/Personal Qualifications;
Completed Contractor Pre-employment Form;
OPM-329-A (Authority for Release of Information);
National Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI) check (if applicable); and
Urinalysis Test (for the detection of marijuana and other drug usage).

By submitting a quotation, the contractor and its employees agree to complete the required documents and undergo the listed procedures. An individual employee of the contractor who does not pass the security clearances will be unable to perform services under the contract. If the resulting contract is to be awarded to an individual, all clearance procedures shall be applied prior to award. Individuals who do not pass the security clearance will not be awarded a contract. The final determination and completion of the security investigation procedures will be made at the sole discretion of the FCC Beaumont. 

All persons are advised that a urinalysis test for the detection of marijuana and other drug usage shall be performed. Any person(s) testing positive shall be disqualified from performing under the resulting contract. Any individual employed by the Contractor deemed not suitable by the BOP requirements will not be granted access to perform services under the contract. This is a condition of the contract. The Contractor must be in compliance with Department of Justice regulations at 8 CFR 274a regarding the employment of aliens. A copy of this directive is available upon the Contractor's request. Contractor employees shall adhere to all institution regulations regarding conduct and performance. Contractor employees will be allowed access to the FCC Beaumont at the sole discretion of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Any individual performing under this contract may be removed if it becomes apparent that his/her conduct does not reflect the conduct of that prescribed for those people performing under this contract. 

NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)
Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201)1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.

1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: 

In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005: 

a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, " Employment Eligibility Verification, " and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);

b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;

c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level: 

High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)
Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)
Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation

d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: 

1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
2) Favorable fingerprint results; 
3) Favorable credit report, if required; 
4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 
5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. 
A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. 

If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). 

e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.

2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: 

It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:

a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
b. Favorable fingerprint results; 
c. Favorable credit report, if required; and 
d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. 

A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. 

3. Intermittent Contractors:

An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. 

a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. 

b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. 

c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. 

d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.

e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 

4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. 

5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. 

52.233-2 SERVICE OF PROTEST (AUG 1996)
(a) Protests, as defined in Section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed directly with an agency, and copies of any protests that are filed with the General Accounting Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The reference number for this requirement is F4FBFM6145A100. 



TO PROCURE A MULTIFUNCTIONAL, REAL TIME QUANTITATIVE SURFACE ANALYTICAL IMAGING SYSTEM with IN-SITU EXPERIMENTATION CAPABILITY and MULTI_ANALYTICAL TOOLS.  Please see requirements listed below for more detailed information.  NAICS: 334516, SIC: 3826, FSC: 6640, SIZE STANDARD 500 employees.  The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i).  This synopsis is being published for informational purposes only.  The proposed source is Kratos Analytical Inc.  The equipment is needed for ultra-thin analysis of thin surface films.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, the government will consider any quotations received by the response date and time provided below.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any quotations should be e-mailed to Jennifer LaShawn Nalls at jennifer.nalls@wpafb.af.mil or faxed to (937) 656-1412 no later than 3:30 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on 25 September 2006.  Any questions should be directed to Jennifer LaShawn Nalls at (937) 522-4550. 



The major technical system requirements that meet the Government's needs are as follows:

a)	The instrument must have the following analytical techniques and tools: Imaging XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy), Auger Spectroscopy, UPS (Ultraviolet Photoemission Spectroscopy), Ion Scattering, In situ heating and cooling.  Having these analytical tools will allow new capabilities for experimentation that will fulfill our research needs.  

b)	The instrument must have a hemispherical analyzer size of 160mm or above.  This feature provides for the needed energy resolution for our applications.

c)	The instrument must be able to provide real time, high spatial resolution (4 micron spatial resolution) imaging that can provide quantitative chemical state information without surface damage.  This feature will allow us to perform real time in-situ experiments on several scales, from macro to micro scales, and will provide quantitative composition and chemical state data.

d)	The instrument must have a co-axial electron flood source for charge neutralization.  This will allow for in-situ experiments to be run without interference from side-angle flood sources.

e)	The instrument must have the spectroscopy and imaging detector in the same plane.  This allows for exact alignment control between the spectroscopy and imaging detection systems. 

f)	The instrument must have greater than 100 detector elements during spectroscopy mode.  This is needed for increased sensitivity of high resolution chemical state information.

g)	The instrument must have a greater than or equal to 500mm Rowland circle x-ray monochromator.  This provides improved spectral resolution that is needed for our tasks.  

h)	The instrument must have chamber geometry that is compatible to customization for future experiments. Our research needs/goals change with time and the instrument must be able to adapt to our changing research directions.

Local clause 52.111-4131 states:  Procedures for commercial vehicle access to F ort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.  Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Iden tification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both ga tes are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal hol idays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commerci al vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commerc ial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request t hat the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5in clearance) will require a time stamped searched- label to g ain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched- labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5in in height and that they will require access to Nor th Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a -searched- label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to No rth Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contract or vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (No rth Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifica lly marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor  is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.- Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  -a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors  pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to For t Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitor s pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.   b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The cont ractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the c ontractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the ins tallation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the  Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), th e contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAG PC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse ti mely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or r eproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC a nd the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge s hall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f .  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4( i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.- Local clause 52.111-4004 states:  -In accordance with the FAR Part Two electronic commerce definition and FAR Subparagraph 4.502 (Electronic Commerce in Contracting P olicy), the Contractor shall communicate with the Government utilizing electronic mail.-  Quoters are required to submit completed copies of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3 and its ALT I, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, and DFAR S 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their quotes.

Information can be found at www.ccr.gov FOB DESTINATION SHIPPING Line Items 13, 81, 91, 92 ; The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, Overseas Installations Branch (IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Transition Brand media converters and chassis.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentís requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.   IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL has identified the Transition media converters and chassis as key components of the Departmentís networking system. Equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of Stateís enterprise network cabling infrastructure based on compatibility with existing Transition media converters and chassis installed at multiple U.S. Foreign Missions and the standardization of warehouse management, bills of materials issuance, and successful installations and subsequent converter replacements.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorís unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentís requirements as a key component of the Departmentís networking system. The Transition Media Converters are necessary for installation and replacement into Transition media converter centers (chassis); other brands of converters are not compatible with each othersí chassisí.  Using other brand name media converters would require restocking the warehouse with other brand name chassisí to accommodate the other brand name converters.  Simple one-for-one replacement would not be practical as it may entail a completely new chassis and multiple media converters at one or more locations, for example, all that may be required is to add a media converter, this would not be possible if the media converter is a different brand than the existing chassis and media converters.

The Installations Branch currently has Corning products in stock and requires the same name brand to maintain distribution system integrity, and standardization of warehouse, bill of materials, and installation managementThe 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.

Using other brand name fiber optic connectors, adapter panels, and rack mount enclosures would require restocking the warehouse with the same other brand fiber optic connectors, adapter panels, and rack mount enclosures and subsequent replacement of the entire warehouse stock of existing compatible items.  Simple one-for-one replacements or additions as needed would not be practical as it may entail a completely new cabling distribution system at one or more locations.

MUST BE ABLE TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION OF AUTHORIZATION FROM REMEDY. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Remedy licenses.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentís requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  CA/CST/DO needs programming capability to implement the new Remedy system.  These software development licenses will be used to create a developmental/test environment for the ARS-DO implementation of the Remedy ITSM products suite.  As well as creating a separate development/test environment for ARS-DO Remedy, these licenses will also allow the DO-Training team to train users using a mirror image of the current product database without impacting the production dataset. The value enhancement of a development environment is the ability to leverage additional features and functionality of the BMC Remedy product line.  Additionally, the environment can be torn down and rebuilt with an exact replica of production environment resources at any time without affecting the productions environment. (4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. (4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. The project team has received a dedicated server intended for use as a development and testing server.  It has been configured and is currently using temporary demo licenses obtained from BMC.  These temporary licenses allow DO to utilize the server for development and testing on the implemented ITSM modules until the purchase of development licenses is completed.  Development and training on the remaining modules cannot be performed in the systemís current state.  Using the dedicated server, the project team will apply the development licenses, which will provide the ability to perform development and testing activities for all ITSM modules in an isolated environment.  The development environment will mirror the production environment in every aspect possible.  Changes made in the development environment can be: ∑	Duplicated in the production environment which will be the case with successfully tested and approved changes ∑	Rolled back in the case of failed changes, unapproved changes, and after each training session to reset the databases, allowing the next training session to be conducted 	Separating the development from the production environment is an industry best practice.  The greatest benefit of the development environment will be that all changes that might cause a service disruption are isolated. Additionally, if developmental efforts have to be performed in the production environment, DOís Remedy ITSM suite would be significantly impeded. Support Contract ID:  32102

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Chief Technology Office.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Department of State approved Desktop IT equipment. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentís requirements of compatibility with existing operational equipment across the DS Enterprise. Because of the interchangeable parts supporting the equipment, it provides a cost effective process in managing an Enterprise asset that is used by DS in all of its CONUS locations. By standardizing on one baseline configuration, the management and support render to the end user is streamlined. DS/CTO/SMD/OPS has identified Dell Desktop equipment as a key component for DS desktop support. Dell desktop equipment is required to provide compatible hardware configuration with existing Department of Stateís enterprise desktop equipment management tools and standardize software configurations that are common to the Brand Name in support of video drivers, NIC drivers and compatible removable drive components. These are essential management tools in support of non-CTO manned Resident and Field office support.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorís unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the DS desktop support requirement. CLARIFIED LINE ITEMS.

<DESC>Answers to questions received at the September 11th site visit follow:

1.	In the back room (which is the future project) are we to install cable for that planned equipment?

Yes, cable will be installed for four media display units, also programming for a control panel for the back room.

2.	Does the government have a microphone requirement in the front room?

No, refer to question 14

3.	Does the government plan on installing a back-up generator to the building?  If so a building UPS is normally part of that configuration, then it would be an overkill to install UPS in the equipment racks.
The generator from Bldg 299 is to be moved to Bldg 91 at the expense of the government.  There will not be a requirement for UPS.

4.	Does the government want the contactor to provide installed projection screens?  If  so, what size?

Yes, this item is revised in the Statement of Work (SOW).  

5.	Does the government plan on installing 4? conduits for the video cable from the rack location to the following locations; plasma?s, projectors, risers and to the back room locations?

No, this will be the responsibility of the contractor/vendor.

6.	Does the government plan on installing a drop ceiling in the front to provide sufficient lighting requirement for the riser location and also it would allow for a cleaner appearance and ease of projector and speaker installation?

No 

7.	Is the government going to provide EOC building drawings?  
Drawings are available but accuracy is not assured.

8.	It says 5 smart technology capabilities.  Is this 5 wall mounted smart boards and will they be used as the screens for the projectors?	

They will not be wall mounted they will be 5 Smart Panel Interactive Pen Displays meeting the following:
-	Drivers must be NMCI compatible.
-	17? screen
-	Software compatible with NMCI

9.	In one place on the SOW it says 4 ? 50 inch plasma?s and 4 LCD projectors and in another place it says 6 plasmas and 6 projectors.  Can they clarify which is which and if they have 6 projectors, what about screens or will the smart boards be the screens.  If it is 6, we will need one additional screen or smart board

?	(4) four, 50? Professional Grade Plasma Screens meeting the following; 
-	Screen Size: 50?
-	HDTV
-	Audio = Stereo
-	Aspect Ratio: 16:9
-	Display resolution: 1366 x 768
-      Installation and mounting hardware required of each with ability to lock equipment in place.

?	(4) four LCD projectors with quad view capabilities meeting the following:
-	Brightness no less than 3500 ANSI Lumens
-	Input compatibility ranges from analog and digital RGB data up to SXGA resolution and video sources from composite through 1080i HDTV with a digital DVI connection
-	Contrast ratio: minimum 900:1
-	Installation and mounting hardware required of each. 	

10.	When is the due date for bids?

September 25, 2006

11.	Will there be any detail provided on the desired lay-out of the video display wall?

Yes

12.	The four-hour required response time stipulation being imposed works in favor or interested A/V contractors who are located in closer geographic proximity.  Would a more reasonable response window be considered?  It was mentioned there will be a back-up EOC should an event arise.

It is essential that a 4 hour maximum response time be mandated should the system fail in a real world scenario.  Once the generator at the backup EOC is moved to the new EOC facility ? the backup EOC will be limited in scope, abilities and practicality.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK FOR UTA WEEKEND LODGING ACCOMODATIONS ATLANTIC CITY AIR NATIONAL GUARD BASE 1.DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES 1.1 This statement of work (SOW) is to provide drill weekend lodging accommodations for eligible military personnel.  Facilities shall be located within a 20-mile radius of Atlantic City Air National Guard Base, Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey 08234, and s hall be compliant with the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-391). 1.2 FACILITIES 1.2.1. 	The contractor must be capable of providing single and double occupancy units.  All units shall be categorized as non-smoking. 1.2.2. 	The contractors' property and units shall meet or exceed industry standards for cleanliness and dÈcor.  The contents of each room shall not be at the end of its life cycle, showing worn or shabby appearance.  Each unit shall be fully furnished, and  as a minimum, shall consist of: a. Bed size shall meet the industry standard for either single or double occupancy b. Private bath and shower facilities, with hair dryers c. Central or individual heating and air-conditioning d. Color television, to include basic cable or satellite service e. Bed, dresser/chest of drawers, desk and chair f. Telephone service for local calls only.  (Guests are responsible for their own long distance charges and will not be paid for under this contract.) g. Iron and ironing board h. All linens (bed & bath) shall be provided 1.2.3. 	The following utilities will be included in this agreement:  Water, Gas, Electricity, Basic Cable TV, Wastewater, Trash, Snow Removal, Lawn Service and Local Phone (no long distance). 1.2.4. 	The contractor shall provide a daily cleaning service. 1.2.5.	Laundry facilities (washers & dryers) must be available, within the property, for occupants use. 1.2.6. 	Individual units shall have secured access. 1.2.7. 	The cost of providing the described lodging, including all utilities and miscellaneous services and supplies, shall be included in the set contract rate. 1.3 RESPONSIBILITIES 1.3.1 One week prior to the UTA weekend, a list will be provided to the hotel, which indicates each member's name, rank, gender, whether they are authorized single or double occupancy and 1 or 2 night's stay.  It is the responsibility of the hotel to check  each person against that list to determine eligibility prior to assigning a room.  1.3.2 Room assignments will be made on a first-come first-serve basis.  Once the contract reaches its maximum allowable rooms (as noted in section 4) then the hotel must contact the 177th Contracting Office to allow for additional rooms. Those personnel re quired to share a room will be doubled up in the order that they call.  For example, caller number one and caller number two will be in the same double occupancy room; then number three and number four.  The only double occupancy personnel allowed to stay in the room by themself will be the last person to call who is an odd number.  For example, caller number 21 will be in a double occupancy room by themself.  This will be for males and females.  If any person scheduled to be in a double occupancy room prop erly cancels his/her reservation then that odd person will be roomed in the newly cancelled double occupancy room.   All double occupancy rooms will be same sex unless the two members are married.   1.3.3 All personnel must call by 1200 (Noon) on the Tuesday prior to the UTA schedule (see section 4).  If by noon Tuesday all the rooms are not used, the hotel is open to use the remaining rooms for their own business.  The number of rooms in section 4 ar e the maximum amount of rooms that the government will pay for during any UTA scheduled weekend.  If less than that is required on any drill weekend then the government will only pay for those rooms that have been confirmed (by noon Tuesday) and 3 extra ro oms (2 doubles and 1 single).  The extra rooms will be in case the base has new recruits or V IPs that come in after the noon Tuesday timeframe.  Again, regardless of when or who calls, the government will not pay above the requested amount in section 4.    1.3.4 If the contract has remaining rooms on it and personnel call after 1200 noon on the Tuesday prior, then the hotel may accept the reservation if rooms are still available at the hotel.  1.3.4 Following each UTA weekend, invoices shall be submitted electronically via Wide Area Work Flow and a hard copy sent to Contracting along with a complete list of all individuals who utilized contract quarters for that period invoiced.  The hotel must indicate any personnel that made a reservation but who did not occupy a room. 1.3.5 Problems encountered by the hotel should be immediately brought to the attention of the 177th Fighter Wing Services Flight or 177th Fighter Wing Contracting Office.  Only individuals from the 177th FW Contracting Office can authorize modifications to  the contract. 1.4 SERVICES OUTSIDE THIS CONTRACT a. Any additional arrangements required by the occupant(s) such as telephone calls and room services outside the scope of services identified in this SOW, will be between the individual and the owner.  Any differences in room cost, e.g., upgraded accommoda tions requested by the individual, or additional (authorized) family members staying in the room, must be paid from the individual's own funds before departure.  The individual must pay any taxes applicable to such arrangements.  The Government is tax-exem pt. b. The Government shall not be held financially responsible for damages to contractor facilities.  The responsibility shall rest with the individual occupying the facility and should be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties prior to the individuals'  departure. c. Any unit member with the rank of E-7 or above who is authorized contract quarters may be accompanied by his/her immediate family.  Members wishing to bring family members must inform the hotel when they make their reservation.  Any additional costs, to be determined by the hotel, will be paid by the unit member (see 1.4.a).   d. Any unit member with the rank of E-6 or below who is authorized contract quarters may be accompanied by his/her immediate family when available.  Due to E-6's and below having to share a room, the eligibility of having family share a room with them will  be on a first come basis as space remains available.  E-6's and below who wish to have family stay with them will first call to make reservations prior to the required time (noon Tuesday before the UTA); then will need to call back after 0800 Wednesday be fore the UTA to check if double rooms are available.  Any additional costs, to be determined by the hotel, will be paid by the unit member (see 1.4.a).    2.
