<DESC><p>The Air Force is sending more Airmen "outside the wire" as our adversaries are armed with tactics and strategies that challenge traditional warfighter capabilities. Mission requirements demand prolonged and repeated exposures to unpredictable and hostile environments, rendering our troops vulnerable to reduced readiness and unidentifiable adversaries. The charter of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Human Effectiveness Directorate, Biosciences and Protection Division (711 HPW/RHP) is to create physical and cognitive sanctuaries to ensure combat survivability, extend human performance, and protect the force. Two major areas of research are: Biobehavioral Performance and Biosignatures. Biobehavioral Performance focuses research to ensure human, individual and team, physical and cognitive performance under stress in operational and extreme environments. Biosignatures integrates biomechanics, anthropometry, and analytic sciences research data to ensure performance and safety for all Airmen. The overall research goal is to enable the human weapon system to meet the current and future battlefield challenges through their biobehavioral performance and biosignatures research.</p>

<DESC><p>A Broad Agency Announcement from NIOSH will be issued on or around October 8th in support of Demonstration and Development of Mine Safety and Health Technology.&nbsp; This BAA is similar to the current NIOSH BAA which is set to expire on 09/30/2008.&nbsp; The BAA will be open till 04/30/2009 and offerors are to examine the BAA for open periods for submittal of concept papers.&nbsp; Offerors are to download the solicitation when issued as paper copies will not be sent and offerors need not be on any list requesting the BAA.&nbsp; The following is a listing of the anticipated areas of interest for NIOSH.</p>
<p>1. Mine Escape Technologies <br />Proposals in this area should focus on any technology or devices that can aid miners in escaping an underground mine following an explosion, sustained mine fire, equipment fire or gas or water inundation. Proposals can address oxygen supplies, location or directional aids, safe haven or refuge chamber concepts or strategies, or any other approach that addresses escape from the underground environment.<br />2. Mine Rescue Technologies (Trapped Miner Location Systems are Excluded from Consideration)<br />Proposals in this area should focus on technology or devices that aid first responders and mine rescue teams to assess the underground conditions, locate miners, minimize the risks and hazards to mine rescue teams, and any other concepts that have the potential to reduce the time needed to rescue miners and/or reduce the risk to rescue teams. Trapped Miner Location Systems are not of interest for this announcement.</p>
<p>3. Technology for Reducing Injuries During Construction, Maintenance, and Repair Operations (Mobile Lifting Systems are Excluded from Consideration)<br />Construction, maintenance, and repair operations at surface and underground mining sites contribute to a significant number of injuries to mine workers. Technologies that can be developed or implemented to prevent or reduce injuries during these particular operations are of interest. Improved lifting systems are not of interest for this announcement.</p>
<p>4. Technology for Reducing Injuries from Equipment, Machinery and Powered-Haulage (Proximity Warning Systems are Excluded from Consideration)<br />The operation of large-size equipment and machinery and the extensive use of powered-haulage systems for transporting mined materials away from the mining sections contribute to a large number of injuries and fatalities at mining sites. Technologies that can be developed or implemented to reduce or eliminate injuries from these systems are of interest. Proximity warning systems are not of interest for this announcement.</p>
<p>5. Communication Systems Using Through-the-Earth Technologies<br />A variety of contracts and research projects are underway for the development of new communication and tracking systems for underground coal mines. One area that is of particular interest for underground mine communication systems is a "true" through- the-earth system that does not require the installation of an infrastructure within the mine. A through-the-earth system would allow for communication from any point in the mine to the surface.</p>

This sole / single source, non-competitive notice is prepared in accordance FAR Parts 5 and 13.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   FAR Part 6  Competition Requirements, is not applicable to contracts awarded using the simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13, not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.      

This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   

The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26.

The total estimated amount of this contract is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $100,000.00. 

The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System code _541990___, with size standard of $7.0M___ .

Market Research conducted by the Government in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 10, Market Research, has determined that the sole / single source reference, is currently the only company that can provide the services / items specified herein. 

THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI),Division of Intramural Research(DIR), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis to Fox Chase Cancer Center, 7701 Burholme Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19111-2497, to provide services in the areas of statistical genetic analyses for the Finnish Prostate Cancer study and the AAHPC study as a continued collaborative effort under protocol OH95-HG-N0158.  These collaborative studies will be very important to the overall success of this research.  

National Human Genome Research Institute, Division of Intramural Research overall mission is to develop and implement technology for the rapid isolation, analysis, and treatment of genetic diseases. The Divisions research laboratories and clinical branches develop and use the most advanced techniques to study the fundamental mechanics of inherited and acquired genetic disorders.


The sole source determination is based on the need to continue the ongoing research collaboration project under protocol OH95-HG-N0158 between the Divisions research laboratories and the Fox Chase Cancer Center.  For the ongoing research project, the NHGRIs Inherited Disease Research Branch, requires a statistical geneticist/technical analyst with experience with programs used for statistical genetic analysis such as SAS, S-PLUS, R, SIMCA, SLINK, GAS , LINKAGE, MERLIN, and GENEHUNTER, and is proficient in computer programming in C++, Java, C, HTML, PERL, XML, PL/SQL. This continuation is critical to the ongoing success of this project. Since, the Fox Chase Cancer Center started the project, it is to the governments best interest not to change the Contract at this time so that the integrity of the research will not be jeopardized.
The purpose of this procurement is to provide professional services to the researchers dedicated to the study.  These services will be in the areas of  providing statistical genetic analyses for the Finnish Prostate Cancer study and the AAHPC study. The analyst will work with the  researcher to perform  linkage and association analyses of prostate cancer in human pedigree data and this will involved a large collaborative effort to identify, isolate and characterize currently unknown genes for this disease. 

The Finnish Prostate Cancer study is a major collaboration between investigators at NIH and in Finland who have collected high-risk families for prostate cancer and are looking for evidence of genetic susceptibility loci in the families. The AAHPC study is a major collaboration between investigators at NHGRI, Howard University, Translational Genomics Research Institute, and Fox Chase Cancer Center, with the data collection portion funded by a prior contract between NHGRI and Howard University. 

The contractor will engage in several activities, including assisting Dr. Bailey-Wilson with construction and checking of pedigree files, checking genotype and trait data for errors (using sophisticated computer programs), estimating allele frequencies, performing linkage and association analyses, and constructing haplotypes to narrow the region where the putative gene may exist. This work requires strong computer skills and high level knowledge of a broad array of statistical genetics techniques and computer programs.   

The contractor will work with Dr. Bailey-Wilson and other members of the NHGRI on a weekly basis.  The contractor will communicate progress and provide summary of activities, either orally or in writing, to Principal Investigator on a quarterly basis, at a minimum.  In actual practice, the Principal Investigator and the contractor will probably be in contact by telephone or email at least on a weekly basis. In addition to the quarterly progress report, the contractor will deliver the data analyses as they are completed. The contractor will meet the principal investigator at a scientific meeting or at the NIH as needed for planning and development of the data analysis efforts.

The contractor will work independently with no direct supervision by any government employee.  The study Principal Investigator and other research team members will provide guidance in terms of technical reporting needs and study requirements of the project supported, plus frequent email and telephone guidance concerning the design and conduct of the analyses and the interpretation of the results.

The contractor will provide her own supplies and space to work.  The government will loan necessary PC computer equipment to the contractor in order to ensure that all government data are stored only on government computers and that all government-required security procedures are followed. The contractor will also have access to government-owned high-speed computer servers at NHGRI so that the analyses can be completed in a timely manner in a secure environment. On occasions when collaborative efforts will occur when the contractor is visiting NHGRI, the contractor will have temporary use of government space and computer equipment on an as-needed basis.

As plans are developed the contractor will provide draft documentation, reports, and progress of the work.  The Principal Investigator will review, inspect, and approve all documentation to ensure that work is in line and following the objectives of the study.

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a response.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Responses to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-(HG)-2008-243-TMB may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6042, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Tracy Brooks.

<SOLNBR>N6893608R0073
<RESPDATE>102408

<DESC>This publication constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) notice pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(E).  No formal Request for Proposals (RFP) or other type of solicitation will be issued. Follow-up questions may be asked of responders for clarification, but this will not indicate a selection of preference.This is not a commitment to fund any effort submitted in response to this request. The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division China Lake (NAWCWD-CL) will not issue paper copies of this announcement.  GENERAL BACKGROUND:  Future Navy guided weapons require increased capability to attack moving and stationary targets in all weather and environmental conditions. Adding the new asymmetric targets from the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) require flexible and low cost weapon solutions to attack these highly mobile threats. The Navy seeks low cost, innovative, and new invention technologies for seekers that will significantly improve the capabilities of existing weapon systems.  The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is conducting a Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) project called the Direct Attack Seeker Head (DASH) to address low cost seeker technology for the highly mobile threat in all environmental conditions. The DASH FNC project has completed its first year of development focused on a low cost radar sensor and must now lay out a more detailed plan for the complete low cost dual mode seeker. The use of new, low cost, high performance components has been critical to obtaining a low cost radar sensor for the DASH and it is anticipated this approach will be required for all DASH subcomponents to meet the cost objective. The use of Government Off-the Shelf (GOTS), Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) or other Non-Developmental Items (NDI) for an imaging sensor and applicable signal processing algorithms is preferred. The DASH goal will be a modular seeker design allowing for a single production line item that can then be integrated into multiple weapon systems using adapter kits. Weapon systems that could benefit from DASH performance and cost benefits vary from Zuni, JDAM, JSOW, JAGM, JASSM, HARM, SDB II, Harpoon, and Tomahawk. For the DASH FNC demonstration, a 5" form factor based on the DSU-33 fuze will be used. This form factor would be compatible with the majority of the possible weapon integrations. The target set for DASH will be stationary and moving targets in land and maritime environments. This seeker shall support fire and forget operation.INFORMATION SOUGHT:  Respondents are encouraged to provide information pertaining to any or all of the topics of interest to the DASH FNC project:  Mature (COTS/GOTS/NDI), small (diameter around 30 mm), low cost (less than $4,000.00 each for quantities of 30,000 units over a five year buy), imaging infrared sensors with detection range capability greater than 2 nmi against a Ford F350 truck size target (moving or not) in multiple background environments in clear weather. It is desired the image would have between 200-800 pixels on a 10 m2 target at a range greater than 1 nmi. Any response should include but not be limited to the following attributes: Field of View (FOV), Instantaneous FOV (IFOV) (if different from the FOV), optical resolution, detector type, format (e.g. array size), cooling requirements if any, detector time constant, frame rate, non-uniformity correction approach and implementation technique, detector NEDT, system spectral band, system NEDT, physical camera size: including optics, FPA electronics, and other processor/control electronics; use of automatic gain control, etc. The imaging sensor must function day and night and in the near vicinity to a radar sensor operating in the millimeter wave region.

<DESC>This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2).A formal Request for Proposals (RFP) and/or other solicitations regarding this announcement will not be issued. The Naval Air Warfare Center in conjunction with the Office of Naval Research (ONR) is soliciting proposals for the development of high technology components and applied research for solid rocket motor components and systems of components. The program seeks to develop and demonstrate new and innovative technology for solid rocket motors in order to expand the operating envelope of current Counter Air (CA) platforms. It is the intent of this program to expand the current state-of-the-art of solid rocket motor technology suitable for use in the AIM-120 +5 Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM) System. It is anticipated that a total of $9.5M will be available for this program over a five year period, subject to appropriation and approval by ONR.
This program seeks to develop innovative, efficient, and cutting-edge technology for use in solid rocket motors used in the AMRAAM system. The technologies developed should improve current system performance of the solid rocket motor used on the AIM-120 Missile System. The full-scale demonstrations for this effort will be heavyweight static tests, flightweight static tests and Insensitive Munitions (IM) tests, and flightweight ground-launched flight tests. The technology developed should be well characterized and suitable for a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 by the completion of this effort. TRL of 6 for this program is defined as a flight demonstration of a prototype rocket motor with the developed technologies integrated into the prototype motor. The flight demonstration will be ground launched, and it is the intent of the government to provide the mechanical integration requirements prior to the invitation of development teams to submit full proposals.
The rocket motor components shall be defined as all the components and sub-systems necessary to operate the motor, except for electrical power used to initiate the igniter. Individual technologies should address such areas as nozzles and nozzle materials, insulation materials, pulse motors (lightweight elastomeric and rigid barriers), increased energy propellants, high volumetrically loaded grain designs, hazard classification mitigation, ground-launched flight test (hardware and software), and composite cases including attachment points. Materials characterization, manufacturing techniques, and mandrel design may be included in the program to the extent that they apply to the platform intended.
Efforts for this program should focus on the development of component hardware to expand the current state-of-the-art of rocket motor technology, however, the government is also interested in analytical techniques and modeling methods that expand the current envelope of existing analytical methods to predict rocket motor performance.
The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) will not issue paper copies of this announcement. NAWCWD reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals in response to this announcement. NAWCWD reserves the right to fund all, some or none of the proposals received under this BAA. NAWCWD provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs. Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned. 
Awards will be in the form of contracts. Therefore, proposals submitted as a result of this announcement will fall under the purview of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).
SEE ENCLOSED ATTACHMENT FOR SPECIFIC INFORMATION AND FORMATTING THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED WHEN PREPARING PROPOSALS FOR THIS CONTRACTING EFFORT.

For the four copiers covered under the agreement, this represents an aggregated image count of 40,000 black-and-white copies and 3,500 color copies per month.  Under no circumstances shall any additional per-image charges apply until the aggregated total number of monthly images (B&W or color, respectively) exceed the aggregated monthly image count.

The contractor shall provide a telephone number and contact name to be used for reporting copier problems, and must assure that the number is staffed during normal business hours (7:00 AM to 5:00 PM, M-F, Eastern Time).  In addition to the supplies in use within a purchased copier, the contractor shall assure that one "spare" set of supplies is available at each copier at all times, so that authorized OIA staff can replace expended components when necessary.  The contractor shall assure that fresh supplies are provided as spares are used.  The contractor shall recycle expended supplies such as toners, etc. 
In the unlikely event that any copier purchased in response to this Statement of Work (SOW) cannot be repaired after three consecutive attempts, the contractor shall replace the defective copier with another of the same or newer model at no additional cost to the Government.

<DESC>USAID/Peru seeks inputs and comments on the attached Draft Scope of Work regarding a potential future program with an overall general purpose to help reduce poverty in targeted areas of Peru through trade-led growth.  This activity focuses on linking micro, small, and medium sized enterprises (MSMEs) to new markets where Peruvian businesses potentially can be competitive.  The recently signed U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA), for example, will provide thousands of MSMEs a competitive advantage over MSMEs in other countries for lucrative U.S. markets.  It is designed to build on the success of the previous ten year program, implemented by Chemonics International, but it also seeks to align with regional economic development initiatives implemented by the Government of Peru and Regional Governments.  The objectives of this activity are to: (1) Expand the ESC model in the impoverished Sierra Departments of Peru to improve the competitiveness of MSMEs; (2) Create strategic public-private partnerships to reduce poverty through trade-led growth; and (3) Increase private and public investments in infrastructure and business development services to support market-led economic activities in the targeted regions. 

USAID/Peru intends to issue an RFP for this program and we seek comments from industry experts.  USAID reserves the right to use any comments received in response to this request in its future plans and documents, however USAID/Peru is not obligated to do so.  USAID/Peru reserves the right to change the attached Draft Scope of Work, based on comments received and its own internal review, prior to issuing the RFP.  This request in no way or form obligates USAID to issue a solicitation, nor does it commit USAID to pay any costs incurred in the preparation and submission of comments to this request.  Any and all expenses incurred in responding to this request for input and comments shall be the responsibility of the individual or organization which provides the comments and not USAID.  The preferred method of submission for comments is via e-mail to Mr. Luis A. Rivera, Contracting Officer at Lrivera@usaid.gov and Mr. Ricardo Toledo, Acquisitions Specialist at rictoledo@usaid.gov.  Responses should be received no later than October 10, 2008 at 5:00 pm, Lima time. 

Thank you for your interest.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Those SBs wishing to form teams or joint ventures for responding to this requirement should refer to 13 CFR 121 and contact their SBA District Office for further detailed information on SB teaming, Joint Ventures, and affiliation rules.
This acquisition will be all tasks required for SB modifications to Products and Systems (See Requirements Traceability Matrix).  A modification is defined as an alteration to a Configuration Item (CI) applicable to aircraft, missiles, support equipment, ground stations, software (imbedded), trainers, etc.  As a minimum, the alteration changes the form, fit, function, or interface of the item.  For the purpose of this program, a SB modification is based on proven technologies, mature technical data packages, established systems engineering processes, commercially available design tools, and Commercial Off-The-Shelf components.

It is anticipated that this program will provide a multiple award indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) task-ordering capability for the procurement of SB modifications and may include engineering, technical, logistics, and other services, spares and repairs in support of SB modifications (hardware and software) for the enhancement of reliability, serviceability, and maintainability, and performance improvements.  Also, this program may include non-recurring engineering, technical documentation, trial installations, ground and flight-testing, kit-proof technical support, kit manufacture and production installation.

<a href="mailto:yvonne.v.smith@us.army.mil">Center for Health Care Contracting</a>
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought synopsis only.  The Center for Health Care Contracting (CHCC), is conducting market research to determine the existence of business sources capable of providing  temporary Mobile Self-Contained Dental Units at Fort McCoy, WI, Fort Dix, NJ, Camp Atterbury, IN, and Camp Shelby, MS.  Other than small businesses are not prohibited from responding to this announcement.  The contractor shall provide services in accordance with the following Statement of Work:  1. GENERAL. The Office of The Surgeon General (OTSG), Army, has directed the United States Army Dental Command (DENCOM) to initiate the Reserve Components Dental Demobilization Mission (RC-DDR) at multiple CONUS sites. The primary tasking of the DDR is to conduct demobilization dental examinations and radiographs on Reserve Component Soldiers who will be returning from theater and demobilizing at Ft. McCoy, WI; Fort Dix, NJ; Camp Atterbury, IN; and Camp Shelby, MS hereafter referred to as the RC Platform. Given the abbreviated timeline of Brigade Combat Teams at the Demobilization site, the existing Soldier Readiness Processing (SRP) dental station and dental clinic at these sites do not have sufficient facility capacity to support the demobilization mission when a Mobilization mission is occurring simultaneously. A concurrent Mobilization mission will have priority over a demobilization mission. The facility requirements to support the mobilization mission will amplify the degree of insufficient facilities to concurrently support the demobilization mission.  In order to meet the mission directive, the DENCOM commander has directed a course of action which consists of using mobile, self-contained dental delivery systems such as trailers or buses to be placed on site at the RC Platforms and staffed with DENCOM acquired personnel to perform the mission.  Exact start dates and end dates are dependent upon conditions in the theatre and airflow schedules from theater to the continental United States (CONUS) demobilization platforms.  The contractor shall be prepared to provide the self-contained mobile dental units with a start date of 01 November 2008. The Government will provide the contractor 14 calendar days notice prior to the start date to have the self-contained mobile dental units set up for operations at any or all of the required sites.

<DESC>CYBER TECHNOLOGY LAB (CTL) SUPPORT<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Auburn University of Auburn, AL for services relating to the development, acquisition, modification, maintenance, and operation of a Cyber Technology Lab.  The proposed acquisition is directed to Auburn University pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.   Since program inception Auburn University has been the only provider of services under Contracts W9113M-04-P-0132 AND W9113M-05-P-0107 and is the only contractor capable of continuing to provide the required highly skilled contractor support services required to meet the needs of the USASMDC Future Warfare Center (FWC).  The services required to meet the needs of the Future Warfare Center (FWC) include a broad range of technical and analytical activities. Auburn University has developed and delivered to the U.S. Government a unique, complex, and comprehensive Computer Network Operations Lab currently referred to as the Cyber Technology Lab. The Cyber Technology Lab has been developed for Government Research and Development, Analysis and Evaluations of Computer Network Operations (CNO) technologies using Department of Defense (DoD)/National Security Agency (NSA) guidelines.  The Cyber Technology Lab is used for developmental training in order for employees to understand the operations of the Cyber Technology Lab to identify and defend zero-day attacks, network defense measures for wireless networks based on firewall, virtual private networks (VPN), intrusion prevention systems, immediate response methods for a mobile user to a number of critical attacks in hotspot/hotel networks, a secure home network and smart phones with defense measures for highly sensitive information access.  This technology is extremely important because it guards against attacks on government wireless network systems.  Auburn University is the only university in the State of Alabama that has been designated by the Department of Homeland Security as the National Center of Excellence in Information Assurance Research.  Auburn University possesses the knowledge, expertise, experience, and ability to apply the needed software vulnerability analysis, correction expertise, and development techniques for intrusion and masquerade detection.  This acquisition will continue to build-up the prior work of Auburn University.  It has been determined that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government not expected to be recovered through competition.  <BR>This action is not open to foreign participation.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>Questions and Clarifications for Minneapolis VA Podcasting Project1.  What kind of length do you see these podcasts at? The only answer I have is that it depends on the script.  It needs to be long enough to cover the topic.2. Should these podcasts include video or still images? Still images.  This project is for audio, not video podcasts.3. Can the script (or at least an outline) be written in advance? In advance of what?4. Can the editing (if video is included) be done afterward at our company?   We're only asking for audio.5. How would you like the quote? E-mail? Fax?   E-mail is fine.6. For the samples requested in section H., can we provide links to digital samples?  Yes7. Beyond including samples and completing Form 1449, would you like a detailed proposal or any further information? We're looking for quotes only.8.	Are you looking for a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) response and if so, do you have an approximate dollar range regarding the contract value? Yes.  I'm not allowed to reveal the government estimate.9.	Is there an incumbent vendor and if so, who ?  No incumbent vendor.10.	Do you have an estimate for the entire length in minutes of the podcasts or vodcasts (video)?  It depends on the script, and we're only looking for audio.11.	How many minutes of video do you anticipate?  We don't know yet, and video isn't a part of this project.12.	Are there existing multimedia assets which may be repurposed for this initiative including video, audio, images, and graphics? No.13.	If a vendor is registered in both CCR and ORCA, does this preclude having to complete the Certs and Reps in the solicitation? Yes.       14. Do you want the pricing submitted separately?  We're only looking for a price submittal.

<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source contract.  The Government intends to issue 
a sole source purchase order to provide conference support services to the Crystal 
Gateway Marriott Hotel located at 1700 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202.  
The total value is  $33,456.44.  The services are needed to support the First Annual 
Hispanic Career Advancement Summit in the Washington, DC area.  The purpose of 
the Summit is to focus on providing management insights, skills training and other career 
opportunities to help Hispanic, government employees maximize their potential. This 
notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination not to compete this 
proposed procurement was made because the Crystal Gateway Marriott had previously 
been awarded a contract by the Department of Defense (DoD) to host this event.  The 
participating agencies have agreed to fund various portions of this Summit with DHS 
taking responsibility for reserving the breakout room space.  DHS is responsible for the 
cost of the training/classrooms that will be provided by the Crystal Gateway Marriott. In 
order for this event to run smoothly, it is imperative that the classrooms be co-located 
within the Crystal Gateway Marriott so that attendees can easily transition from key-note 
lectures that will be held in a large auditorium/ballroom, to individual break-out sessions 
that will be held in various classrooms.  Co-locating the classrooms will alleviate the 
inconvenience of having participants travel from building to building as the summit 
transitions from key-note lectures to break-out sessions.  Because of the number of 
potential employees involved, and because DoD has contracted with Crystal Gateway 
Marriott for hotel room accommodations, DHS determined that providing classroom 
accommodations within the Crystal Gateway Marriott for the breakout sessions is the 
most efficient and cost effective option as it will decrease travel time and expense for the 
participants and the agencies involved.

<RESPDATE>092508
<CONTACT>Melody P Bryant, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-681-1216, Fax 703-681-0346, Email melody.bryant@disa.mil
<DESC><p>This notice is to publicize a brand name justification.&nbsp; The intent is to use Enterprise Software Initiative Blanket Purchase Agreement for the Veritas Netbackup with maintenance support.
<p>&nbsp;1. Nature and/or description of the action being approved:</p>
<p>The Office of Information and Knowledge Management (OIKM) is responsible for the contingency and recovery planning for the Defense Information Systems Agency Management Information System (MIS) development and test systems. The OIKM system administrators are required to provide redundancy, continuity, and backup, also known as archive, of mission essential applications and data through a secure and reliable system. The purchase of Veritas Netbackup with maintenance support will aid in centralizing the management and operations of backup and recovery and is the most comprehensive solution for data protection across the entire enterprise.</p>
<p>2. Supplies or services required to meet Agency needs:</p>
<p>These products, first of their product type developed specifically for the Microsoft environment and now includes the Solaris environment, are the most comprehensive solution for protection against data loss, disaster recovery and storage management. Veritas NetBackup Enterprise Server software is designed to help provide complete data protection for the most complex environments. Intuitive graphical user interfaces help enable organizations to manage all aspects of backup and recovery and to help maintain consistent backup policies that are deployed across the enterprise. They are specifically designed for complex messaging and transactional intensive databases such as the MIS databases. They are considered the ultimate solution for providing uncompromised reliability and recoverability in a cost effective manner across the DISANet Enterprise infrastructure. Support entitles the OIKM to product upgrades and corporate level technical support which is essential for maintaining the highest level of protection against data loss. It is essential that these products are kept current through upgrades and releases in order to ensure full network data protection and recovery against catastrophic events.</p>
<p><br />3. Statutory authority (10 U.S.C 2304 (c) (1):</p>
<p>No other supplies or services will satisfy the agency's requirements. The agency's requirement is for a specific make and model.</p>
<p>4. Demonstration of Manufacturer's or Contractor's Unique Qualifications:</p>
<p>The Veritas Netbackup is the primary backup system software used on the DISANet production platforms. Software support entitles DISA the rights to upgrades, revisions and fixes as released and expert technical support throughout the fiscal year without incurring additional expense. It is imperative, for the protection of the MIS databases, to maintain the software with version upgrades as released and have expert technical assistance available when needed. The current software is compatible with the servers.</p>
<p>Obtaining existing software is more advantageous than procuring a new, unproven product. It would be wasteful and inefficient to test and prototype unproven data protection software tools when Veritas has the attributes that OIKM requires. Moreover, new software would require upgrading all current servers and would also incur training costs. Based on these facts, Symantec products will satisfy the agency's requirement.</p>
<p>5. Statement of Period of Performance and/or Delivery Schedule:</p>
<p>The period of performance will be from date of award for a period of 1 year (for maintenance). &nbsp;Deliverable Schedule (tangible items): 30 September 2008.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Technovative Applications (TA), Brea, California, for an increase to the ceiling on the current TA Contract DASG60-00-C-0091.  The proposed action is pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  This action is to support continuation of current efforts relating to modifications to the existing TA Precision Tracking System (PTS) radars and operations and maintenance of these radars at national test ranges.  Upgraded PTS radars will be required for operations in the September 2008 timeframe.  Award to any source other than TA would result in unacceptable delays and substantial costs.  This action will be a modification to the existing cost plus fixed fee contract.  The ceiling increase will support the execution of work planned through June 2009.  The significant duplication of cost involved with a new contractor is considered to be well beyond any cost savings that might be achieved through competition.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, this action is directed toward Technovative Applications.  This acquisition is not open to foreign firms.  All responses should be directed to Dianne Trimble at dianne.trimble@smdc.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days from the publication date of this synopsis.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiated with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent to negotiate a sole source modification to Contract DASG60-00-C-0091 is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit a response which will be considered.  This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation.  Telephone or facsimile inquiries and/or responses will not be accepted.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to announce the revision of the contract maximum order amount on the Global Media Development, Production and Dissemination Support
contract supporting the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  Awarded in June 2005 as a Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract with an anticipated period of performance through June 2010.  In June 2006, the option period was exercised for only one of the three contracts.  The contract provides support for managing, coordinating and conducting media approach planning; developing prototype products; producing commercial quality media; distributing and disseminating products; and analyzing media effects. This contract also facilitates the development, production and dissemination of multi-lingual audio, video, printed and web based products in support of specific USSOCOM goals and objectives.  To continue this critical support, it is necessary to increase the maximum order amount of this contract from $100M to $175M.  This action is due to an accelerated pace of contract requirements in response to the expansion of USSOCOMs operational tempo as it prosecutes the Global War On Terror.  One or more competitive procurements are anticipated as future follow-ons to this contract. The contractor is MPRI, Inc., a division of L-3 Services Inc.; contract number H92222-05-D-0012.
The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

This product alone will meet the Government's requirements because it is the only software product of its type that can be used with the ten print fingerprint scanners and must be installed on workstations to capture 10 fingerprints from each via applicant.  use of this software will enhance the Government's capabilities of identifying and weeding out miscreants, felons, terrorist, and other individuals know to US law enforcement agencies who are attempting to faudulently gain entry to the United States by using false identities.<BR><BR>

These products will provide the rapid reporting and resolution of any problems inhibiting the function of any Consular operation or system.  This J&A supports the purchase of the Remedy on a brand name only basis.  The requirement will be competed among the three Remedy resellers. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.  This requisition is to renew the existing support contract which is justified by the following qualifications, unique to this requirement:  The BMC Remedy ITSM suite has been in use in DO since August 2005.  Internal and external groups utilize this system to inform and resolve problem areas and to manage the process of issue resolution.  Prior to last August, the programs used by DO to track trouble tickets and assets had traditionally been customized, internally developed applications.  Based on many analyses, DO moved from the custom application to an out-of-the-box solution that leverages industry standards and realigned business processes with industry best practices.  The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>i.	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<BR><BR>ii.	The solicitation number is F6J0BAFY20081 and is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  Offerors shall consider any language or terminology contained herein, through inclusion by a clause or provision, or communication, to be that which is related to the type of solicitation indicated in this paragraph (e.g. quote versus offer, proposal, or bid).<BR><BR>iii.	The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26. <BR><BR>iv.	This notice is unrestricted. The associated NAICS code is 451140 and small business size standard is $7,000,000.  The Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program does not apply for this acquisition. <BR><BR>v.	Request quote on the following item(s) and quantity(s):  SEE ATTACHED ITEM LIST - All quotes shall list the line item number indicated in the equipment listing.  It is prefered, though not required, that offerors submit their line item pricing in a spreadsheet with a format similar to that provided in the equipment listing.<BR><BR>vi.	Applicable  Offerors shall quote Brand Name or Equal.  Items shall meet or exceed the salient physical, functional, and performance characteristics of the brand name requested.  All offerors proposing equal items shall provide sufficent product literature for Government evaluation.<BR><BR>vii.	Applicable - Quotes shall clearly specify a delivery date and type of freight transportation (FOB destination or origin).  It should be noted that the Government prefers FOB destination.  Delivery shall be made to Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base, 76127 for inspection and acceptance by an authorized Government official, unless otherwise indicated by the contracting officer.<BR><BR>viii.	Applicable - The provision at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition; as well as the following addenda: N/A  (validate)<BR><BR>ix.	Applicable - The Government shall utilize the evaluation procedures shown below in lieu of the provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items.  The Government intends on awarding a contract resulting from the solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  <BR><BR>The following factors shall be used to perform a Best Value evaluation of quotes:  Price and Mission Capability (includes, but is not limited to, quality, delivery, and volume/number of items offered)<BR><BR>The Government does not intend on issuing multiple awards (split awards), as the ability for an offeror to accurately quote and the Government to adequately evaluate some items is largely dependant upon the acceptance of other items (e.g. custom cases in relation to the equipment it houses); thus a single award is contemplated.  <BR><BR>Offerors should note that quotes are not required to be submitted on an all or none basis; therefore partial quotes will be accepted for evaluation.  As such, the Government may award a contract for a portion of the items listed should it represent the overall Best Value to the Government.<BR><BR>In the course of evaluating quotes, the Government may elect to utilize tradeoffs among price and non-price factors.  The purpose of such tradeoffs is to allow the Government to obtain the most advantageous mix of Price and Mission Capability.  If in the event the Government cannot obtain both by means of a single quote, it will determine if it is more advantageous to go with a higher priced quote with a higher degree of capability, or a lower priced quote with a lower degree of capability. <BR><BR>x.	Applicable - Offerors shall include a copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, and FAR 52.219-1 (Alt I), Small Business Program Representations, with their quote.  Any quote received by the Government not including these provisions may result in the Government not considering your quote for evaluation.  The Government may provide these documents as an attachment to this solicitation or via email; though offerors are encouraged to download the most current reference from http://farsite.hill.af.mil.  ***Note  Offerors may elect to complete the representations and certifications online at https://orca.bpn.gov.  When completing online via ORCA, the offeror is still required to provide a written copy of FAR 52.212-3, Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, though section (k) of this provision need only be completed (written copy of FAR 52.219-1, Small Business Program Representations not required).

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 (Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items). 

The International Programs Division, U. S. Department of State, Washington DC intends to award a sole source contract to FACTIVA (DOW JONES;  Dow Jones & Company, Inc., 1025 Connecticut Ave., NW, Suite 1103, Washington, DC 20036,  DUNS # 138449173.

This service provides exclusive access to the package of Wall Street Journal,      Agence France-Presse, Reuters, and AP, sources which are essential to the work done by IIP and IRCs.   Examples of other sources exclusively available through the service are the international editions of the Wall Street Journal, Thai News Service, Yonhap (Korean) English News, and TASS World Service.  One of the strengths of the service is its access both to foreign language news sources and to foreign news sources in English that either are not available or are not aggregated elsewhere (a total of some 22,000 sources), including sources available only on the web. The service is available via one, user friendly interface.
 
Beyond the content, the service also provides, as requested and crafted by  users,  automatic and customized issue alerts several times daily in intuitive, user-friendly formats.  These are readily manipulated so as to be made available to Chiefs of Mission, PAOs and other designated embassy personnel and embassy contacts.    
  
In order to prevent substantial delay in this fulfillment of the follow-on requirement, and duplication of effort that is not considered recoverable a sole-source action is determined justified.  A determination has been made that a new contractor cannot perform the tasks within the allotted timeframe.  

This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract, it does not restrict the Governments ultimate approach, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any proposal preparation cost, the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or substituting a response to this notice.

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>WAWF INSTRUCTIONS<br />WIDE AREA WORK FLOW (WAWF) PROGRAM</p>
<p><br />In March 2003, the Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Supplement (DFARS) subpart 232.70 - Electronic Submission and Processing of Payment Requests was issued. In accordance with this, we are excited about the deployment of a new system, Wide Are Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA). This Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) system will benefit both you and the Air Force as we partner with each other in the implementation of this new way of conducting business. It is also important to note that in addition to this, the Department of Defense (DoD) Appropriations Act of 2001, Section 1008 - Electronic Submission and Processing of Claims for Contract Payments, requires that any claim for payment under a DoD contract shall be submitted in electronic form. The full text is found on the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) web site http://www.dod.mil/dfas/legislative/ and in 10 U.S.C Chapter 131.</p>
<p>WAWF-RA is designed to automate commercial invoices and government receiving reports in a web-based, paperless environment. WAWF-RA allows vendors to create and instantaneously submit invoices and receiving reports directly to DFAS and/or government receivers from any location in the world. Once documents are submitted, vendors are afforded full viewing capability and are able to monitor document status from submission to acceptance and processing by the DFAS payment office. WAWF-RA utilizes e-mail to notify all parties involved in the payment process of the current status of each document; thus eliminating U.S. mail lag-time.</p>
<p>Since documents will now be entered and stored in a database, there is no need for multiple copies. They cannot be "lost" or "misplaced", and are viewable by all necessary parties during the entire payment process via a secure web site. Changes to rejected documents can be easily made and resubmitted on-line - - no more re-typing, resending, or re-faxing. Discounts become available on the first day of the discount period instead of being lost due to paperwork shuffling and postal delays. WAWF-RA should speed up the vendor payment process and get you your money faster.</p>
<p>McGuire AFB began using testing this new system in February 2004 and plans to fully implement it by April 2004. There are no costs involved to get you started. Registration and software are provided FREE OF CHARGE and we will be available to assist you in every step of the way. To get started, your company will need a user ID and password for accessing the WAWF-RA system. This can be obtained by visiting the WAWF-RA website at https://wawf.eb.mil/ and following the instructions under Help with registration for access to WAWF-RA. Under About WAWF - RA, you will also find links for Functional Information, Setting Up Your Machine, Accessing Web Based Training, and Frequently Asked Questions. Additionally, we have attached a Wide Area work Flow - Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions, Installation, and Registration Checklist. Should you have questions about the WAWF-RA system or the website, please don't hesitate to contact a Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) customer support representative toll-free at 1-866-618-5988 or e-mail them at cscassig@ogden.disa.mil. (Please include "WAWF" in the subject line of all e-mail requests.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attachment:<br />WAWF-RA Vendor Instructions, Installation, and Registration Checklist</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions <br />Installation and Registration Checklist</p>
<p>Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the firm and user accounts.</p>
<p>1. Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered.</p>
<p>&bull; If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below. <br />&bull; For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk,<br />888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil, or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.</p>
<p>2. Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR).</p>
<p>&bull; All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/. <br />&bull; Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.). <br />&bull; Note: All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually. Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.</p>
<p>3. Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC).</p>
<p>&bull; The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company. You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm. <br />&bull; To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/ and click on "Search CCR." Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query." If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS. <br />&bull; Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page. There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC. If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet. If you see that there is no one listed as your company's EB POC, you need click on "Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN" to add it. <br />&bull; Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC's (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination. <br />&bull; The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor's organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor. <br />&bull; Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Until NAICS codes are updated, update will not be complete. For more info on NAICS codes, visit: http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html</p>
<p>4. Determine if your organization will designate a Group Administrator (GAM) (Proceed to paragraph 5 if you are not going to designate a GAM).</p>
<p>&bull; In medium to large sized companies, there may be a need to establish more than one GAM. <br />&bull; A GAM determines who has access to the WAWF-RA vendor account. <br />&bull; The initial GAM shall be the person designated as the EB POC. To appoint additional GAM's, each vendor must submit an official appointment letter signed by the EB POC. <br />&bull; The appointment letter should be faxed to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />&bull; The Group Administrator's Manual is available for reviewing to all WAWF-RA registered users. <br />&bull; The GAM Manual can be found in the Software Users Manual link within the WAWF-RA application.</p>
<p>5. Establish an organizational email address</p>
<p>&bull; All records created in WAWF-RA are stored in a virtual file folder and as status is updated or changes the system generates an email notification to applicable individuals identified in the firm's organizational email account. <br />&bull; The GAM or EB POC shall provide the organizational email to the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />&bull; Ensure that your firm's organizational email address is operational and can receive email from WAWF-RA prior to registering your email address with the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center. <br />&bull; Note: If you do not set up an organizational email address, the personal email address of the first person who self-registers from your firm (CAGE/DUNS code), will be designated as the organizational email address for your firm.</p>
<p>6. Set up PCs to access WAWF-RA<br />&bull; Set up the PCs of your organization's users to access WAWF-RA. <br />&bull; Select the "Setting Up Your Machine" link on the WAWF-RA home page for more information: https://wawf.eb.mil/Instr.html.</p>
<p>7. Have all users self-register on the WAWF-RA web site<br />&bull; Every user for your firm must self-register on the WAWF-RA web site by completing the online registration form. <br />&bull; Select the "Self Register" link on the WAWF-RA home page and follow the instructions. <br />&bull; Users may access WAWF-RA with either a User ID/Password combination or a PKI certificate. Users who want to use a PKI certificate must obtain it before self-registering. <br />&bull; PKI Certificates may be obtained from one of the approved Interim External Certificate Authorities: Operational Research Consultants Inc. http://eca.orc.com, Digital Signature Trust Co. http://www.digsigtrust.com/home.html, or Verisign: http://www.verisign.com. The web sites provide the instructions needed to acquire a PKI Certificate. <br />&bull; If further assistance is needed, contact the WAWF-RA Customer Service Center.<br />&bull; Note: Registrations will not be activated until the WAWF-RA Customer Support Center receives an email from the EB POC/GAM as registered in the CCR data- base.</p>

<p>1st Endorsement, Contracting Officer</p>
<p><br />Signature Block of Procurement/<br />Administrative Contracting Officer<br />Attachment 6 Contractor Free Zone Requirements and Procedures</p>
<p>A6.1. Free zones are temporary zones without protection level resources that are created within restricted areas when construction projects and similar activities make normal circulation controls inappropriate. <br />A6.1.1. Requests to establish free zones must be coordinated with those agencies involved in the project, including the unit commander or staff agency chief having immediate responsibility for the operational resources of the area, the 305 SFS/CC and 305 SFS/S-3ISR. <br />A6.1.2. Free zones are limited in size to the minimum necessary for the contract work to be completed. The free zone must seclude the construction area from the restricted area.<br />A6.1.3. The ISC approves free zone establishment and concept of operations. Free zone approval must be in writing and is maintained by 305 SFS/S-3ISR and the organization most responsible for the project.</p>
<p>A6.2. Requests to establish free zones will be submitted by letter to the Installation Security Council (ISC) voting membership after routing through the unit commander having immediate responsibility for the operational resources of the area, the restricted area OPR, and the 305 SFS/CC. <br />A6.2.1. Projects within or adjacent to flight line controlled areas must be routed through 305 OSS/OSAM and Flight Safety (305 AMW/SE) prior to submittal to the ISC. <br />A6.2.2. The 305 AMW/CV is the final approving authority.<br />A6.2.3. Written requests for free zone establishment must contain the following information:<br />A6.2.4. Estimated start and completion dates of the project.<br />A6.2.5. Physical description of the area.<br />A6.2.6. Prohibited areas.<br />A6.2.7. A map indicating the requested free zone area and access routes to or from the free zone.<br />A6.2.8. An outline of security procedures to be used to ensure restricted area integrity.</p>
<p>A6.3. If a contractor is completing the work, the installation contracting officer gives the contractor a letter signed by the installation commander or the group commander responsible for the security of the area, outlining the contractor's security responsibilities.</p>
<p>A6.4. The USAF organization or agency most directly associated with the project must watch the free zone boundary, provide escorts, and prevent unauthorized entry into the restricted area. Ensure sufficient personnel are available to provide constant surveillance for the entire free zone boundary.</p>
<p>A6.5. Entry control to restricted areas containing free zones will not be delegated to contractors.</p>
<p>A6.6. The USAF organization or agency most directly associated with the project ensures the free zone boundary is clearly marked with an elevated rope, barrier, fencing, or other suitable material, clearly delineating it from the restricted area. Normally, the provision and placement of boundary materials and markers are included in the contract as a contractor responsibility. <br />A6.6.1. Signs identifying the free zone should face away from the free zone, so that they are visible upon approaching the free zone. <br />A6.6.2. Restricted area signs will be placed every 100 feet on the inside of the free zone boundary, visible to workers inside the free zone, clearly marking the restricted area boundary where it adjoins the free zone. <br />A6.6.3. Security forces will provide technical assistance in marking and maintaining the free zone boundary. (Note: Free zones WILL NOT be granted to replace, or granted as a convenience in place of, the need for escort officials and escorts.)<br />A6.6.4. The free zone will be closed and secured at the end of working hours each day.<br />A6.6.5. SFCC will be notified by owner/user prior to opening/closing/securing the free zone.<br />A6.6.6. Security forces must conduct a sweep of the free zone area when closed for the day in areas containing PL1 and 2 resources.<br />A6.7. Free Zones for Protection Level 4 Resources (Controlled Areas). <br />A6.7.1. Free zones are established within controlled areas when construction projects and similar activities make it inappropriate/impractical to apply normal circulation controls. <br />A6.7.2. Establish a free zone corridor from some point on the controlled area boundary to the work project to aid in moving personnel and equipment.<br />A6.8. Controlled Area Free Zones. Establish free zones when construction projects or other temporary work activities make escort procedures impractical. Follow these general guidelines.<br />A6.8.1. Allow entry to the project work area at some point on the boundary of the controlled area with a free zone corridor.<br />A6.8.2. Ensure that the responsible activity maintains surveillance over the boundary of the free zone.<br />A6.8.3. Close the free zone and secure the controlled area after normal work project hours.<br />A6.8.4. If the temporary free zone inside a CA requires contractors to complete work around sensitive equipment or materials, owner/user personnel will be present any time contractors are in the area or will have the sensitive equipment or materials removed from the area.</p>

<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ) are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)</p>

<p>(1) ( ) In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or</p>
<p>(2) ( ) Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act.

<p>( ) (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror ( ) does ( ) does not certify that--</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>

<p>WAWF INSTRUCTIONS<br />WIDE AREA WORK FLOW (WAWF) PROGRAM</p>
<p><br />In March 2003, the Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Supplement (DFARS) subpart 232.70 - Electronic Submission and Processing of Payment Requests was issued. In accordance with this, we are excited about the deployment of a new system, Wide Are Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA). This Electronic Commerce (E-Commerce) system will benefit both you and the Air Force as we partner with each other in the implementation of this new way of conducting business. It is also important to note that in addition to this, the Department of Defense (DoD) Appropriations Act of 2001, Section 1008 - Electronic Submission and Processing of Claims for Contract Payments, requires that any claim for payment under a DoD contract shall be submitted in electronic form. The full text is found on the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) web site http://www.dod.mil/dfas/legislative/ and in 10 U.S.C Chapter 131.</p>
<p>WAWF-RA is designed to automate commercial invoices and government receiving reports in a web-based, paperless environment. WAWF-RA allows vendors to create and instantaneously submit invoices and receiving reports directly to DFAS and/or government receivers from any location in the world. Once documents are submitted, vendors are afforded full viewing capability and are able to monitor document status from submission to acceptance and processing by the DFAS payment office. WAWF-RA utilizes e-mail to notify all parties involved in the payment process of the current status of each document; thus eliminating U.S. mail lag-time.</p>
<p>Since documents will now be entered and stored in a database, there is no need for multiple copies. They cannot be "lost" or "misplaced", and are viewable by all necessary parties during the entire payment process via a secure web site. Changes to rejected documents can be easily made and resubmitted on-line - - no more re-typing, resending, or re-faxing. Discounts become available on the first day of the discount period instead of being lost due to paperwork shuffling and postal delays. WAWF-RA should speed up the vendor payment process and get you your money faster.</p>
<p>McGuire AFB began using testing this new system in February 2004 and plans to fully implement it by April 2004. There are no costs involved to get you started. Registration and software are provided FREE OF CHARGE and we will be available to assist you in every step of the way. To get started, your company will need a user ID and password for accessing the WAWF-RA system. This can be obtained by visiting the WAWF-RA website at https://wawf.eb.mil/ and following the instructions under Help with registration for access to WAWF-RA. Under About WAWF - RA, you will also find links for Functional Information, Setting Up Your Machine, Accessing Web Based Training, and Frequently Asked Questions. Additionally, we have attached a Wide Area work Flow - Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions, Installation, and Registration Checklist. Should you have questions about the WAWF-RA system or the website, please don't hesitate to contact a Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) customer support representative toll-free at 1-866-618-5988 or e-mail them at cscassig@ogden.disa.mil. (Please include "WAWF" in the subject line of all e-mail requests.)</p>

<p>Attachment:<br />WAWF-RA Vendor Instructions, Installation, and Registration Checklist</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Wide Area Work Flow Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) Vendor Instructions <br />Installation and Registration Checklist</p>
<p>Completion of all instructions contained in this checklist must be accomplished prior to activation of the firm and user accounts.</p>
<p>1. Check Central Contractor Registration System (CCR) to see if your company is registered.</p>
<p>&bull; If you are registered in CCR, please go to Step 3 below. <br />&bull; For help with registration in CCR, contact CCR Helpdesk,<br />888-227-2423 or 269-961-4725, e-mail CCR@dlis.dla.mil, or see the CCR Handbook at http://www.ccr.gov/handbook.cfm.</p>
<p>2. Register with Central Contractor Registry (CCR).</p>
<p>&bull; All vendors desiring to bid on goods or services in support of Department of Defense (DoD) must be registered in the CCR at http://www.ccr.gov/. <br />&bull; Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed in your new CCR account (i.e., Telephone/FAX number, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) and/or Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) codes, North American Industry Code Systems (NAICS) codes, etc.). <br />&bull; Note: All contractors are required to update their CCR registration annually. Failure to do so will result in suspension of the account, which will prevent or delay awarding DoD contracts and payments to your firm.</p>
<p>3. Establish an Electronic Business Point of Contact (EB POC).</p>
<p>&bull; The next step is to ensure that you have identified an EB POC for your company. You are required to establish both a primary and alternate EB POC for each CAGE/DUNS code assigned to the firm. <br />&bull; To see if an EB POC is listed for your company, go to http://www.ccr.gov/ and click on "Search CCR." Where prompted, enter the DUNS or CAGE or Company Name and click "Submit Query." If you are presented with a list of DUNS numbers, you will need to pick the specific location and click on the DUNS. <br />&bull; Scroll to the bottom of the Inquiry Results page. There you can see if anyone is listed as the EB POC. If no one is listed, your company has not identified an EB POC yet. If you see that there is no one listed as your company's EB POC, you need click on "Update or Renew Registrations Using TPIN" to add it. <br />&bull; Each vendor organization may establish up to two EB POC's (primary and alternate) for each Cage/DUNS combination. <br />&bull; The EB POC will be responsible for authorizing access to employee(s) of the vendor's organization to view and/or modify data submitted on behalf of the vendor. <br />&bull; Update NAICS codes developed by the Census Bureau, which replaced the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes.

<p><br />Signature Block of Procurement/<br />Administrative Contracting Officer<br />Attachment 6 Contractor Free Zone Requirements and Procedures</p>
<p>A6.1. Free zones are temporary zones without protection level resources that are created within restricted areas when construction projects and similar activities make normal circulation controls inappropriate. <br />A6.1.1. Requests to establish free zones must be coordinated with those agencies involved in the project, including the unit commander or staff agency chief having immediate responsibility for the operational resources of the area, the 305 SFS/CC and 305 SFS/S-3ISR. <br />A6.1.2. Free zones are limited in size to the minimum necessary for the contract work to be completed. The free zone must seclude the construction area from the restricted area.<br />A6.1.3. The ISC approves free zone establishment and concept of operations. Free zone approval must be in writing and is maintained by 305 SFS/S-3ISR and the organization most responsible for the project.</p>
<p>A6.2. Requests to establish free zones will be submitted by letter to the Installation Security Council (ISC) voting membership after routing through the unit commander having immediate responsibility for the operational resources of the area, the restricted area OPR, and the 305 SFS/CC. <br />A6.2.1. Projects within or adjacent to flight line controlled areas must be routed through 305 OSS/OSAM and Flight Safety (305 AMW/SE) prior to submittal to the ISC. <br />A6.2.2. The 305 AMW/CV is the final approving authority.<br />A6.2.3. Written requests for free zone establishment must contain the following information:<br />A6.2.4. Estimated start and completion dates of the project.<br />A6.2.5. Physical description of the area.<br />A6.2.6. Prohibited areas.<br />A6.2.7. A map indicating the requested free zone area and access routes to or from the free zone.<br />A6.2.8. An outline of security procedures to be used to ensure restricted area integrity.</p>
<p>A6.3. If a contractor is completing the work, the installation contracting officer gives the contractor a letter signed by the installation commander or the group commander responsible for the security of the area, outlining the contractor's security responsibilities.</p>
<p>A6.4. The USAF organization or agency most directly associated with the project must watch the free zone boundary, provide escorts, and prevent unauthorized entry into the restricted area. Ensure sufficient personnel are available to provide constant surveillance for the entire free zone boundary.</p>
<p>A6.5. Entry control to restricted areas containing free zones will not be delegated to contractors.</p>
<p>A6.6. The USAF organization or agency most directly associated with the project ensures the free zone boundary is clearly marked with an elevated rope, barrier, fencing, or other suitable material, clearly delineating it from the restricted area. Normally, the provision and placement of boundary materials and markers are included in the contract as a contractor responsibility. <br />A6.6.1. Signs identifying the free zone should face away from the free zone, so that they are visible upon approaching the free zone. <br />A6.6.2. Restricted area signs will be placed every 100 feet on the inside of the free zone boundary, visible to workers inside the free zone, clearly marking the restricted area boundary where it adjoins the free zone. <br />A6.6.3. Security forces will provide technical assistance in marking and maintaining the free zone boundary. (Note: Free zones WILL NOT be granted to replace, or granted as a convenience in place of, the need for escort officials and escorts.)<br />A6.6.4. The free zone will be closed and secured at the end of working hours each day.<br />A6.6.5. SFCC will be notified by owner/user prior to opening/closing/securing the free zone.<br />A6.6.6. Security forces must conduct a sweep of the free zone area when closed for the day in areas containing PL1 and 2 resources.<br />A6.7. Free Zones for Protection Level 4 Resources (Controlled Areas). <br />A6.7.1. Free zones are established within controlled areas when construction projects and similar activities make it inappropriate/impractical to apply normal circulation controls. <br />A6.7.2. Establish a free zone corridor from some point on the controlled area boundary to the work project to aid in moving personnel and equipment.<br />A6.8. Controlled Area Free Zones. Establish free zones when construction projects or other temporary work activities make escort procedures impractical. Follow these general guidelines.<br />A6.8.1. Allow entry to the project work area at some point on the boundary of the controlled area with a free zone corridor.<br />A6.8.2. Ensure that the responsible activity maintains surveillance over the boundary of the free zone.<br />A6.8.3. Close the free zone and secure the controlled area after normal work project hours.<br />A6.8.4. If the temporary free zone inside a CA requires contractors to complete work around sensitive equipment or materials, owner/user personnel will be present any time contractors are in the area or will have the sensitive equipment or materials removed from the area.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to correct the Set-Aside code that was previously used. The subject solicitation was inadvertently posted as a Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) set-aside which violates Department of Defense (DoD) policy. The DoD has suspended the use of SDB set-asides resulting from the Supreme Court decision in the case of Adarand v. Pena. The intention was to solicit this requirement as a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business set-aside, and the mistake was administrative in nature. Please see the amended solicitation to reflect the aforementioned change(s).<BR>

<DESC><p>THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS/ANSWERS ARE ADDED.</p>
<p>Question: What "make" of CATV or satellite communications systems does the customer use (i.e. Jerrold, Scientific Atlanta, etc.)?</p>
<p>
<p>Answer: Adelphia/Comcast/Dish and DirecTV are the satellite systems in use.</p>
<p>Question: Approximately how many feet of new cable need to be installed to extend and/or change CATV locations?</p>
<p>Answer: The government provides the cable. The amount of cable would depend on the location of the existing drop and where the new drop is required and will vary depending upon specific requirements throughout the contract.</p>
<p>Question: Does "underground installations" refer to trenching or pulling cables in existing underground conduit?</p>
<p>Answer: There is the possibility of both trenching and pulling cables.</p>
<p>Question: Approximately how many vehicles will need mobile radios and other equipment installed/replaced?</p>
<p>Answer: This changes yearly depending on whether or not we are changing out GSA /DHS vehicles, adding additional vehicles, upgrading the vehicle radios or just replacing radios/broken radios in vehicles.</p>
<p>Question: What makes/models of "special police/emergency" equipment are used?</p>
<p>Answer: Once again this equipment is provided by the government and changes due to needs, agency support and vehicle.<br />Question: Will all specialized equipment along with the test equipment be provided by the government? What types of specialized equipment will be involved in this project other than what was identified in this S.O.W. (other than 2-way mobile, CATV, CCTV, IDS, fire suppression systems, etc.)? <br />Answer: Yes, all equipment to be installed will be supplied by the government.<br />Question: Approximately how many classrooms and special training areas will need audio/visual equipment? Of these rooms, how many have existing cabling?</p>
<p>Answer: This number changes due to the construction of new buildings and training facilities. Not all rooms or facilities have pre-existing cable and some that do will have to have the existing cabling replaced.</p>
<p>Question: Does the audio/visual equipment consist of televisions, intercoms, etc?</p>
<p>Answer: Depending on the location and training venue or administrative requirements, it may require television or intercom installation.</p>
<p>Question: Approximately how many cameras for the CCTV system will be installed? Will all new cabling need to be installed for the security system?</p>
<p>Answer: This will change by location and with the construction of new building and training facilities. Most areas will require new cabling or fiber, some will use existing. The number of cameras to be installed is determined by physical security requirements and training venues.</p>
<p>Question: If access control is needed, approximately how many doors?</p>
<p>Answer: Again this is determined by the physical security requirements, the addition of new facilities or the change in usage of an existing facility.</p>
<p>Question: In order to do work, government property may have to be moved or protected. Will it be the contractor's responsibility to move and store government equipment or will that be handled by the government?</p>
<p>Answer: The contractor will be responsible for this.</p>
<p>Question: Will be the contractor's responsibility to protect government property which may not be able to be moved and is in the construction or installation area?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, the contractor will be responsible for this.</p>
<p>Question: How many varied types of systems (sounds systems, fire suppression systems, and 2-way mobile) will be worked concurrently in one or several locations? This information will be needed in order to determine the make-up of the work crew(s) by the contractor.</p>
<p>Answer: This is determined on a daily basis, as new requirements are identified or equipment needs to be replaced due to being damaged or out of date.</p>
<p>Question: Is there an Incumbent Contractor and if so, who?</p>
<p>Answer: The incumbent contractor is Video Showcase, Darien, Georgia.</p>
<p>Question: What is the Government Estimate for this SOW?</p>
<p>Answer: The IGE is not provided to potential bidders/anyone outside Government.</p>
<p>Question: Who is responsible for transporting the equipment from storage to the installation sites?</p>
<p>Answer: The contractor will transport equipment from the on-site storage facility to the installation site.</p>
<p>Question: What Security Clearances are required, if any?</p>
<p>Answer: Background checks are required for access to the facilities. The applicable security clause is added to the solicitation package.</p>
<p>Question: What is the total building square footage and building count for each location?</p>
<p>Answer: The Government does not consider this a relevant question, because the jobs are done on an hourly basis. All buildings do not require these audio/visual installations and there is no way to predict which ones will at this time.</p>
<p>Question: The SOW (Paragraph #1) states there are three FLETC locations, and then list four cities. Can Alvtiiq assume that four is the correct number?</p>
<p>Answer: Currently the contractor will only support three sites. The SOW has been changed to reflect three sites (Brunswick, Georgia, Charleston, SC and Cheltenham, MD).</p>
<p>Question: Is an equipment list (inventory) available so Alvtiiq can create a more accurate offer?</p>
<p>Answer: This is not an answerable question, the equipment varies and new procurements of equipment will change what is in the inventory.</p>
<p>Question: Is it possible to extend the due date by a week?</p>
<p>Answer: This solicitation has been extended until September 29, 2008</p>

<a href="mailto:tiffany.boatwright@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>N65236-08-R-0210-0002- 23 September 2008The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions and provideclarification.Questions:1)The end "A" connector described on the drawing specification, para. 4.1.1,states a DB-9F, which is a 25-pin connector. The required 9-pin connectorshould be a DE-9S or DE-9P.Response: This was a typo.  Paragraph 4.1.1 should state DE-9P2)The solicitation spec and para. 4.1.1 of the drawing both state jackscrewswithfemale type ends while the drawing shows jack posts.Response: The drawing shows jackscrews with a female type (as stated in thespecs and para. 4.1.1).  Jack posts are not required.3)The specification states that the cable shall flow toward the bottom of theradio, yet the drawing spec shows pin 29 of the 32-pin connector located in away that would cause the cable to flow toward the top of the radio, since pin29is next to the connector key which is toward the top of the radio.Response:  The connector on our drawing should show pins 29 and 32 locatednext to the connector key.4) Please provide a cable assembly in order to create a schematic.Response: The Government does not have a cable assembly available.  This isthe first time these assemblies have been purchased.  We currently haveradios in theater without the appropriate cable.5)Please provide Ohmmeter readings for the pins.Response: Please contact the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) forOhmeter readings of the radio. The radio is a type 1 encrypted device.SPAWAR does not have the authority to release proprietary data about theradios.6) The gauge size of the cable used is 28 gauge.  Can you please advise why20 gauge is being specified?Response: The 20 gauge is correct.  For this cable, the government requires 20gauge cable.7) Do we have a part number for the cable.Response: No.8) What is the purpose of the contract number listed on bottom right of thecable specs documentResponse:  Disregard.  The contract number is not applicable to thisprocurement.The hour and date specified for receipt of offer remains 26 September 2008 at2:00 PM.  Offeror must acknowledge receipt of this amendment prior to theoffer due date listed herein in writing.  A simple statement acknowledgingreceipt of amendment 0002 is sufficient.N65236-08-R-0210-0001- 22 September 2008The purpose of this amendment is to revise the solicitation specifications anddrawing, request a product sample of the cable, and answer questions.1.

<DESC>N65236-08-R-0210-0002- 23 September 2008The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions, update drawing for rev2 and provide clarification for other issues.Questions:1)The end "A" connector described on the drawing specification, para. 4.1.1,states a DB-9F, which is a 25-pin connector. The required 9-pin connectorshould be a DE-9S or DE-9P.Response: This was a typo.  Paragraph 4.1.1 should state DE-9P2)The solicitation spec and para. 4.1.1 of the drawing both state jackscrewswithfemale type ends while the drawing shows jack posts.Response: The drawing shows jackscrews with a female type (as stated in thespecs and para. 4.1.1).  Jack posts are not required.3)The specification states that the cable shall flow toward the bottom of theradio, yet the drawing spec shows pin 29 of the 32-pin connector located in away that would cause the cable to flow toward the top of the radio, since pin29is next to the connector key which is toward the top of the radio.Response:  The connector on our drawing should show pins 29 and 32 locatednext to the connector key.4) Please provide a cable assembly in order to create a schematic.Response: The Government does not have a cable assembly available.  This isthe first time these assemblies have been purchased.  We currently haveradios in theater without the appropriate cable.5)Please provide Ohmmeter readings for the pins.Response: Please contact the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) forOhmeter readings of the radio. The radio is a type 1 encrypted device.SPAWAR does not have the authority to release proprietary data about theradios.6) The gauge size of the cable used is 28 gauge.  Can you please advise why20 gauge is being specified?Response: The 20 gauge is correct.  For this cable, the government requires 20gauge cable.7) Do we have a part number for the cable.Response: No.8) What is the purpose of the contract number listed on bottom right of thecable specs documentResponse:  Disregard.  The contract number is not applicable to thisprocurement.The hour and date specified for receipt of offer remains 26 September 2008 at2:00 PM.  Offeror must acknowledge receipt of this amendment prior to theoffer due date listed herein in writing.

<DESC>N65236-08-R-0210-0002- 23 September 2008The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions, update drawing for rev2 and provide clarification for other issues.Questions:1)The end "A" connector described on the drawing specification, para. 4.1.1,states a DB-9F, which is a 25-pin connector. The required 9-pin connectorshould be a DE-9S or DE-9P.Response: This was a typo.  Paragraph 4.1.1 should state DE-9F ( where F isfor Female). We need the 9-pin connector.  See http://www.nullmodem.com/DB-9.htm.  The "DB-9F" is not a 25 pin connector.  It is the Government'sunderstanding that the 9 stands for the number of pins.2)The solicitation spec and para. 4.1.1 of the drawing both state jackscrewswithfemale type ends while the drawing shows jack posts.Response: The drawing shows jackscrews with a female type (as stated in thespecs and para. 4.1.1).  Jack posts are not required.3)The specification states that the cable shall flow toward the bottom of theradio, yet the drawing spec shows pin 29 of the 32-pin connector located in away that would cause the cable to flow toward the top of the radio, since pin29is next to the connector key which is toward the top of the radio.Response:  The connector on our drawing should show pins 29 and 32 locatednext to the connector key.4) Please provide a cable assembly in order to create a schematic.Response: The Government does not have a cable assembly available.  This isthe first time these assemblies have been purchased.  We currently haveradios in theater without the appropriate cable.5)Please provide Ohmmeter readings for the pins.Response: Please contact the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) forOhmeter readings of the radio. The radio is a type 1 encrypted device.SPAWAR does not have the authority to release proprietary data about theradios.6) The gauge size of the cable used is 28 gauge.  Can you please advise why20 gauge is being specified?Response: The 20 gauge is correct.  For this cable, the government requires 20gauge cable.7) Do we have a part number for the cable.Response: No.8) What is the purpose of the contract number listed on bottom right of thecable specs documentResponse:  Disregard.  The contract number is not applicable to thisprocurement.The hour and date specified for receipt of offer remains 26 September 2008 at2:00 PM.  Offeror must acknowledge receipt of this amendment prior to theoffer due date listed herein in writing.  A simple statement acknowledgingreceipt of amendment 0002 is sufficient.N65236-08-R-0210-0001- 22 September 2008The purpose of this amendment is to revise the solicitation specifications anddrawing, request a product sample of the cable, and answer questions.1.  The detailed specifications and drawing are revised as attached (DATA-REMOTE CONTROL CAB Rev 1.pdf).  Disregard all other drawings andspecifications.2. Under the "Additional Specifications" listed in the combinedsynopsis/solicitation, the cable length shall be 18 inches (shielded) insteadof12 inches.3. A product sample shall be delivered to Tiffany Boatwright in care of NancyStraight, Code 5.3.1.5.0, SPAWARSYSCEN Charleston, 1639 Avenue B North,North Charleston, SC  29405-1639 no later than 26 September 2008.  Thetracking number for this sample shall be sent along with your proposal no laterthan 2:00 PM EST on 26 September 2008. The Government will not pay anyshipping costs related to the submission of the sample.  The product sampleshall be tested by the Government to determine technical acceptability.4. Questions and Answers  Question A. The cable length shall be 12 inches.  What is the (wire)gauge of that?Answer A: The cable should be 18" long, and 20 gaugeQuestion B:  Under 4.1.2, End B connector- Who is the manufacturer?Answer B: End B connector- Harris and AMTI are the only manufacturers knownby the Government. End A, the DB-9, is a common connector made by manymanufacturers.5. The hour and date specified for receipt of offer is hereby extended to 26September 2008 at 2:00 PM.  Offeror must acknowledge receipt of thisamendment prior to the offer due date listed herein in writing.  A simplestatement acknowledging receipt of amendment 0001 is sufficient.Drawing and Specifications attached-17 September 2008This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared inaccordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented withadditional information included in this notice.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/RELO INDUSTRY FORUM
Travel and Transportation Acquisition Support Division
General Services Administration
Employee Relocation Services
September 23, 2008


GENERAL INFORMATION

1.0	OBJECTIVE
On September 23, 2008, the General Services Administration (GSA) will host an industry information session to conduct market research to refine a proposed new guaranteed home sale services model.  The purpose of the information session is to solicit feedback from industry on the proposed model, stakeholder requirements, and other pertinent issues to assess viability of the model and its requirements.
   
2.0	PROBLEM STATEMENT
Federal civilian agencies relocate approximately 28,000 civilian employees annually.  Approximately 12,000 of these employees receive guaranteed home buyout assistance as a relocation benefit to expedite the sale of their home, maximize the sale price, and access the homes equity. This is an important human capital benefit for recruitment and retention and, for some agencies, is a requirement to ensure personnel are mobile for mission-critical functions.  Historically, 85% of guaranteed home buyout services were procured via GSAs Multiple Award Schedule, entitled Transportation, Delivery and Relocation Services Schedule (Schedule 48).
Under the terms of Schedule 48, Relocation Service Providers (RSPs) assume all burden and privilege of ownership of the relocating employees home if the home does not sell within a specified period.  For this service, RSPs charge fixed percentage rates based on the homes sale price.
Recent downturns in the housing and lending markets have significantly affected suppliers ability to provide guaranteed home sale services to the Government under the Schedule because the model requires suppliers to bear all risks at fixed percentage rate pricing.  Under commercial models, RSPs offer services under cost-reimbursable contracts and transferees private-sector employers bear the risks of owning the homes.   
GSA has assessed models based on commercial standards and best practices to develop a new guaranteed home buyout model to supplement home buyout services currently offered under Schedule 48.  The objective of this new model is to task a service integrator with acquiring commercially priced guaranteed home buyout services that include full mortgage payoff that may be made available to the government at fixed percentage rate pricing.  GSA wishes to acquire this capability through one commercial source which has contracts with the necessary range of suppliers and services, to accomplish the vision as described in the draft statement of objectives. The DRAFT sow may be obtained by e-mailing your request to: transportation.programs@gsa.gov and onthego@gsa.gov using the subject line RELO INDUSTRY DAY.  

3.0	DISCUSSION OF INTEGRATE HOME SALES SERVICES INITIATIVE
Below are some the questions that GSA will address during the Industry Forum:

1. What is the vision of this guaranteed home sale contracting vehicle?
2. What is the impact on the existing GSA schedules?
3. What are the roles, responsibilities, and anticipated requirements for the various stakeholders who would participate in this service as conceived in under the proposed model?
4. Will there be unique technology-related or security-related requirements? 
5. What is the tentative timeline for the procurement?

4.0	INDUSTRY FORUM

GSA is hosting an Industry Forum to refine its requirements for a proposed New Home Sale Services contract.  GSA shall discuss preliminary information regarding the program initiative. The industry forum is scheduled as follows:

Tuesday, September 23, 2008
1:00 PM (ET)  4:00 PM (ET)
Room L1301 
2200 Crystal Drive
Arlington, VA 22202

An industry forum may be used when the Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes. This meeting does not obligate the government in any way to issue an RFQ for the services discussed.

5.0	RESPONSES

GSA requests feedback, comments, concerns, recommendations on the proposed guaranteed home buyout contracting vehicle. Respondents are encouraged to think broadly about how to best achieve the desired services.  

Vendors are encouraged to mark each page believed to contain corporate sensitive information with the note Proprietary Information. Responses should be based on the material contained in this announcement and any other relevant information the vendor thinks is appropriate..

<DESC>*Amendment 001, dated 9/23/08, issued to correct pages under initial SIR and to correct Attachment J.1.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes to issue a requirement for the replacement of battery systems at twenty-five (25) Air Route Traffic Control Center Critical/Essential Power System (ACEPS) facilities.  The requirement is for the replacement of 1 or 2 battery strings at each ACEPS site, which will be listed under the Screening Information Request.  Some of the sites have 3, 4, 5, or 6 battery strings, therefore multiple trips to a site could be required to accomplish all string replacements.
The requirement is being considered for an Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) consisting of a one year base period and four one-year options periods for a total contract period not to exceed 5 years, or 60 months.
Competition is limited to small business concerns.  Firms must be classified as a small business under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 335911 - 500 employees.  Firms shall complete and submit the attached Business Declaration form with their proposal.      
The ACEPS Battery Replacement project proposed under this requirement consists of the following general requirements, as a minimum:
a.	The battery strings shall consist of 192 ea. cells/jars.  b.	Each single cell jar shall have a float voltage of 2.25 volts per cell (Vpc).c.	End of duty cycle voltage or minimum voltage during duty cycle shall be 1.67 Vpc.d.	Sealed jars, i.e. the jars have no provision for the addition of water or electrolyte or for external measurement of electrolyte specific gravity.e.	Lead-Acid Cells.  Cells in which the electrodes are made of lead or lead alloys and the electrolyte is a solution of sulfuric acid.f.	The battery shall utilize a technology that has been used by the Vendor for a minimum of 5 years.g.	Battery string footprint (maximum):  240" L x 28" D x 88" Hh.	Maximum weight of battery jar:  240 lbs.
The anticipated issue date of the Screening Information Request (SIR)/Request for Offer (RFO) is 11 September 2008, with a scheduled closing date of 28 October 2008.  A copy of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer can be located at:  http://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm, on/or about the issue date noted above.       
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 335911; Storage Battery Manufacturing, with a small business size standard in number of employees of 500.
Interested sources are encouraged to review the SIR/RFO and provide questions or comments in writing to Kenneth.M.Carter@faa.gov, or via facsimile at: (202) 267-5420, by 1:00 p.m. EDST, 25 September 2008.  Comments should be submitted in Microsoft Word 2003 format only.  Responses to Q&As will be posted to the FAA Contract Opportunity database as soon as they are available.  (Note: The FAA will not respond to telephone inquiries.)  
The FAA proposes to conduct a Pre-proposal Conference under the subject requirement at the FAA's Atlanta ARTCC Site located in Hampton, GA.  The details of the Conference (time, date and other pertinent information) will be outlined in the SIR.  As this is an active facility, proposed attendees will be required to submit the following information no later than one week prior to the scheduled conference date: 1) Name of Attendee(s), limited to two; 2) Name and address of company being represented; and any additional questions not previous submitted under separate cover.
