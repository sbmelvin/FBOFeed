<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Software Engineering Resource Center (SERC) at the William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) has a requirement to procure all labor, materials, and equipment necessary to perform the tasks associated with the development of initial capabilities of the National Aerospace  System (NAS) Adaptive Services Environment (NASE) which will enable  users to access NASE data and services.  The NASE is an initiative of the SERC's Adaptation Improvement Program (AIP). The NASE Software Software Architecture must support the planned incremental release of functionality, techniques for interfacing a variety of data access tools by various FAA organizations, and enable the implementation of all required security strategies.  The current aeronautical and adaptation data environment consists of multiple modern and legacy systems and processes.  The FAA intends to create a secure IP-based system that facilitates interoperability of NAS support systems.  The contractor shall be responsible for the provision of the entire scope within the schedules specified in the individual task orders.  The period of performance is a base year with four one year options.  The Screening Information Request (SIR) Document with the Statement of Work (SOW) for this procurement is attached as DTFACT-07-SERC.   Any questions can be directed to Mario Maccarone via e-mail at mario.maccarone@faa.gov.   This SERC SIR will be a full and open competitive procurement.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541512 with a size standard of $18.0 million.  The FAA intends to award an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ), time and material contract.

<CONTACT>Steve Manley, 202-385-8676
<DESC>This public announcement advises industry that the ADS-B Screening Information Request planned for issuance the week of November 20, 2006 has been rescheduled for issuance the week of November 27, 2006.  The response date will also be extended a week to January 24, 2007. The following clarifications are made regarding the ROM cost data.  1.  The FAA Acquisition Management System requires some form of cost data if a screening information request SIR is to be used to down-select vendors.  2.  ROM costs will not be used to extrapolate any projected cost for the program.  3.  The costs will be evaluated to determine consistency/intertwining between the technical approach, vendor assumptions regarding the degree and content of effort, and the ROM.  For instance, use of existing inventory or sites will have an impact on the ROM cost.  The ROM cost can be supported by assertions and assumptions i.e. "A 1090 radio transmitter will have to be developed".    4. The SIR responses will be evaluated with regard to understanding the requirement and the effectiveness/risk of the approach.  5.  As stated in Industry Day #3, the SIR is considered the gateway for vendors who are likely to receive an award.  The SIR response will not be evaluated as a "best value" analysis which is used to determine who receives an award in response to a Request for Offer.    As previously communicated to industry, the FAA is seeking creative and innovative approaches to providing Broadcast Surveillance Services as contemplated under a performance based service acquisition  Vendors may propose approaches which satisfy the functional requirements while not specifically conforming to the schematics depicted in the essential and critical specifications.  Delivery of ADS-B, TIS-B, and FIS-B services to service delivery points is the primary requirement.       Those vendors selected for further discussions will be required to develop a Small Business Subcontracting Plan prior to contract award.  The Contracting Officer will provide goals through coordination with the FAA Small Business Office. In addition, the FAA Surveillance and Broadcast Services Office will incorporate the FAA Mentor-Prot√©g√© Program into any resultant contract.  An approved Mentor-Protege agreement will be required prior to contract award.    The FAA Mentor-Prot√©g√© Program is designed to motivate and encourage firms to assist Small Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVSB), Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI) and Women-Owned (WO) Small Businesses in enhancing their capabilities to perform FAA prime contracts and subcontracts, foster the establishment of long-term business relationships between these entities and Mentor Firms, and increase the overall number of these entities that receive FAA prime contract and subcontract awards.

<DESC>The Alaska National Wildlife Refuge System invites the submission of new proposals in support of Alaskan natural resource management and science camps, both as components of the 2007 CCS program. A few proposals will also be accepted for the winter (October through February) of Fiscal Year 2008. Project proposals must demonstrate a strong relationship between a non-federal group and an Alaskan U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service office. This is the initial announcement for this funding opportunity.  The CCS program is an annual funding source set up on the federal fiscal year schedule; therefore, the objectives and work identified in the proposals selected for award under this announcement must be completed no later than September 30, 2007. The Service will award multiple CCS projects generally ranging between $1,000 and $30,000.  The Service may use cooperative agreements, procurement contracts, service contracts, grant agreements, or CCS agreements as the award vehicle.  The actual award instrument used depends entirely upon the type of proposal submitted and the nature of the project therein.  The Service will award multiple federal assistance (Challenge Cost Share Agreements) and / or acquisition instruments (Challenge Cost Share Contracts) to multiple recipients.  The nature of the specific project will be the determining factor in whether Challenge Cost Share Agreements or Challenge Cost Share Contracts are awarded.  The Federal Grants and Cooperative Agreements Act of 1977 is the defining factor in how a federal agency decides whether a project is "federal assistance" or "federal acquisition".  The decision factors associated with the Act may be viewed at the following link   http://elips.doi.gov/elips/release/3080.htm. A twin posting of this announcement can found on www.grants.gov.

<DESC>The National Technology Alliance (NTA), Integration Information Office (II), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).  This announcement is a request for information (RFI) only and is not a request for proposals nor is it an indication that NGA intends to contract for services that enable the development of critical new technologies at this time.  

The NTA is a government program that was established in 1987 with a mission to influence commercial and dual-use technology development with an emphasis on meeting national security and defense needs. The NTA has current agreements with industry to influence and provide for the access, management, facilitation, and encouragement of the development of commercial solutions and dual-use technologies.   Critical technologies of interest to the NTA include data storage, telecommunications (Wireless, VOIP), networking, information processing (data mining, knowledge management, data fusion etc.), data visualization, Geo-spatial intelligence (Geospatial analysis, imagery analysis etc.), chemical/biological sciences as well material sciences supporting these technologies.  

The NGA is the Executive Agent for the NTA program and intends to issue a Broad Area Announcement (BAA) for its NTA support contract in spring 2007.  The NTA uses a non-traditional contract authority, "Other Transaction (OT) for Prototype" to fund commercial-based solutions for government technology needs.  OT agreements are instruments other than procurement contracts, grants or cooperative agreements used to carry out prototype projects and independent assessment and evaluations of technology and processes that are relevant to weapons systems proposed to be acquired or developed by the Department of Defense or the Department of Homeland Security. OT authority is generally interpreted broadly to include not only weapon systems themselves, but also sub-systems, components and technologies relating to weapons, auxiliary and support equipment that are directly relevant to weapons or weapons systems.

This announcement is part of the market research to identify which companies and/or universities specialize in leading, managing, coordinating and integrating the activities of diverse technology development teams; and has the capability and experience to stay appraised of current technology developments and trends. The Government is also interested in knowing which companies and universities are interested in participating in the NTA program.  

Responses to this RFI should contain pertinent organizational information, including a point of contact, phone number, and an email address.  A two page (maximum) organizational profile sheet identifying primary technology capabilities and accomplishments may be submitted.  Additional information such as marketing pamphlets will be accepted.  Any information marked proprietary will be treated accordingly.  

Responses to this RFI should be emailed to Mr. James B. Troutman, Agreements Officer, at james.b.troutman@nga.mil, no later than close of business on December 4, 2006.  A confirmation of receipt will be provided within 3 days of being received.  If a confirmation of receipt is not provided, please email Mr. Troutman, and copy Mr. Paul Nagele at paul.a.nagele@nga.mil and call Mr. Troutman at 703-264-2173.

<DESC>This solicitation is a Multiple Award Service Contract (MASC)for Operations & Maintenance Services and is restricted to 100% percent Small Business Concerns to be procured as a commercial items acquisition in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561210 and the size standard is $32 million dollars.  This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award three (3) or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Operations and Maintenance contracts for work to be performed at various Naval and Marine Corps installations located in SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, NEVEDA, AND ARIZONA. The basic contract period will be for 12 months. Each contract contains nine (9) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 120 months. The Government will not synopsize the options.  The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $90,000,000.  The contract will end when 120 months is reached, or when $90,000,000 for all contracts combined is reached, whichever occurs first.  This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.  The task order range for this contract is between $2,500 and $8,000,000.  Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract.  The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the Government through issuance of a task order.  After award of the initial contract(s), each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in the contract.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered to each awardee under the performance period of the contract. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Services to be performed under the resulting contract(s) may include the following facility investment & utilities operations and maintenance: Building & Structures maintenance (interior & exterior finishes, plumbing, grease traps, exhaust hoods & ducts, electrical, structural, bridge & jib cranes, re-lamping, and locksmith); Building Systems (HVAC, fire protection, VTE, intrusion detection systems, boilers, and compressed air systems); Miscellaneous (cathodic protection systems, emergency generator systems, uninterruptible power systems, and lightning arrestors & grounding devices); Roads & Paved surfaces (traffic control devices, striping, curbs, sidewalks and parking lots, bridges, and drainage systems); Waterfront (piers & bulkheads, and wharfs); Trackage (railroads, crane, and elevated crane); Airfields (runways, taxiways, and navigational aids & lighting); Family housing/Bachelor Quarters; Miscellaneous Items (signage, fencing, and food service equipment); chiller plants, electrical, gas, wastewater, steam, and water.  The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following:  
Factor 1 - Experience
Factor 2 - Past Performance 
Factor 3 - Technical Approach
Factor 4 - Management
Factor 5 - Safety
Factor 6 - Price
Relative Importance of the Evaluation Factors: The evaluation factors are divided into two categories; non-price evaluation factors (Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5) and price (Factor 6).  Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are of equal importance.  When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, the non-priced Factors 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5 are approximately equal to Price, Factor 6.  The importance of price will increase if offerors non-price proposals are considered essentially equal in terms of technical quality, or if price is so high as to significantly diminish the value of a proposal?s technical superiority to the Government.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and represents the best value to the Government, price and non-price factors considered.  Proposed Task Order (PTO) 0001: The Contractor shall be required to perform maintenance, repair, and minor construction for hoods, vents, exhaust units, make-up air units, air handling units, and heating and air conditioning units at various locations at Camp Pendleton, California, see solicitation for specific locations.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to purchase SMARTpool? siARRAY? libraries directed against (1) the GPCR genes (2) genes involved in apoptosis (3) Part III of the Druggable Genome (4) Standard siGENOME SMARTpool? reagent A collection from Dharmacon, 2650 Crescent Drive #100, Lafayette, CO 80026. SMARTpool? reagents are mixtures of four siRNA molecules (short, duplexed RNA oligonucleotides) designed to work in a highly defined manner to target a specific sequence within an mRNA such that cleavage of that mRNA is mediated, leading to a decrease in the protein encoded for by that mRNA. The sequence of each siRNA is unique, and extensive bioinformatic analysis has been carried out to ensure that each siRNA sequence will provide both maximum efficacy and target specificity. Dharmacon Inc. is the only source known to the NIDDK that has developed and continued to enhance their own proprietary algorithm that addresses these issues and thus the SMARTpool? siRNA libraries produced by them are unique in composition. NIDDK has worked with and optimized their system and assay using Dharmacon SMARTpool? siRNA reagents for over one year. Dharmacon has done significant research and publication on the design of functional siRNA and has developed a proprietary algorithm for the design of these reagents which has lead to a guarantee of 75% knockdown (the highest guarantee for any company in the industry) for the SMARTpool? siRNA reagent and 3 of the 4 individual siRNAs. Approximately 85% of SMARTpool? reagents silence target gene expression by 95% or more.  Use of these reagents specifically from Dharmacon is necessary for the consistency and reproducibility in our experiments; these reagents, plus a large number of others that have been purchased in the past from Dharmacon, are part of an overall study in which direct comparison of the results is necessary. Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to current research in progress.  One of the key elements to successful siRNA experiment is maximal and specific knockdown of the intended target gene. This becomes especially true in screening when a great number of targets are evaluated for functionality for further specific evaluation. The phenotype we are looking for can be hard to achieve and a high level of knockdown will be critical to the success of our experiments. In addition, Dharmacon uses a patented 2'ACE? chemistry for the synthesis of these reagents which minimizes the risk of degradation of the RNA.  Specifications Required for All Sets: 1.  75% knockdown guaranteed for the SMARTpool? siRNA reagent and 3 of the 4 individual siRNAs (for follow up studies) measured by mRNA levels at 24 hours and normalized for transfection efficiency.  2.  Reagents must be SMARTpool? siRNA reagents consisting of 4 duplexes designed against a specific target dried down in a well.  3.  These Sets must be delivered within two weeks upon receipt of order.  4.  Must use 2'ACE chemistry for the synthesis of RNA duplexes for the purpose of consistency and efficacy.  5. ON-TARGET? modification - selectively used to enhance selection of highly function siRNAs by inhibiting sense strand involvement in RISC-mediated knockdown. This selective use allows for silencing of highly conserved sequences while Specifications for siARRAY? siRNA libraries for GPCR, Protein Kinase, and Mouse Drug Targets Part III:  1.   The SMARTpool? reagents must be delivered as 0.5 nmoles per well. 2.   The GPCR library must consist of 474 SMARTpool? reagents 3. The Protein Kinase library must consist of 719 SMARTpool? reagents 4.    Mouse Drug Targets Part III is a proprietary set of genes provided by Dharmacon Specifications for siGENOME reagent A collection: 
1.   The SMARTpool? reagents must be provided as 2 nmoles per well
2. This is a unique collection of targets developed in cooperation with Dharmacon.  All responsible businesses that are capable of providing the Government with the items that are listed above may request a copy of the Request for Quote (RFQ) in writing or by FAX to 301-480-8501 to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date of this notice.  It is anticipated that RFQ NIH-NIDDK-07-059 will be available fifteen (15) days after the publication date of this synopsis.  Receipt of quotations will be due ten (10) days after the release of the RFQ.  The anticipated award date is December 8, 2006.  Request for copies of the RFQ must be submitted to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, Two Democracy Plaza, Room 774B, Bethesda, MD 20817 or via email: griffinv@mail.nih.gov to the Attention: V. Lynn Griffin.  FAX quotations must contain offerors name, address, telephone number and fax number.  FAX quotations will be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.  All requests for quotations should have a valid email address.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Carlos Uriel Barragan Mina, Jefe del Grupo de Energia y Sistemas Electromecanicos, Unidad Administrativa Especial de Aeronautica Civil, Aeropuerto Internacional El Dorado, Piso 4, Bogota, D.C., Colombia, Tel: +57 (1) 266-2225, Fax: +57 (1) 266-3820 Civil Aviation Renewable Energy Project, Colombia.  The Grantee (Unidad Administrativa Especial de Aeronautica Civil, "AeroCivil") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study for the Civil Aviation Renewable Energy Project.

The objective of the Feasibility Study is to develop a plan for using renewable energy technologies to supply the power to operate remote radar installations, navigational aids sites, aeronautical communications stations, and aeronautical meteorological stations throughout Colombia. 

The Feasibility Study will be undertaken on the basis of a detailed assessment of nine remote aeronautical facility sites (El Paso, El Tablazo, Jurisdicciones, Mitu, Providencia, Puerto Inirida, Puerto Leguizamo, Santa Ana, and Tubara), beginning with a review of renewable energy systems that are currently in operation at some of the sites.  The nine sites are a representative sample of the 260 remote facilities in terms of facility type, geography, and anticipated renewable energy source.  The Feasibility Study will propose specific renewable energy technology solutions based on the nine sites, which in turn will allow AeroCivil to proceed with the conversion of the rest of its generating stations with a limited need for additional site-specific assessments.

The Terms of Reference ("TOR") for the Feasibility Study include the following tasks: 1) Perform Site Visits and Gather Data to Assess the Current Infrastructure of the Renewable Energy Power Supply System; 2) Develop Updated Resource Forecasts for the Nine Sites; 3) Determine the Best Technical Options and Create a Prioritized Investment and Development Plan; 4) Present Technical, Economic, Financial, and Environmental Feasibility Analyses for each of the Technical Options; 5) Develop Financing Options; 6) Conduct development impact assessment; 7) Provide a Renewable Energy Power Supply System Development Plan; and 8) Final Report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $700,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals ("RFP"), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM (local time in Bogota, Colombia), December 20, 2006, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) intends to award a performance-based contract for Chemical Management Services (CMS) at the retail level.  The solicitation will be full and open.  The purpose of the Department of Defense (DoD) CMS program is to provide an overarching strategic, performance-based approach where a CMS provider manages the rapid replenishment of hazardous materials and related services in support of the customer?s requirements.  The goals of this CMS program go beyond invoicing and delivering product to the customer; they emphasize the optimization of processes, the continual reduction of chemical lifecycle costs, and the reduction of risks and impacts to employees and the environment.  The type of contract will be Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) in accordance with FAR Part 12.  It is the government?s expectation to make at least two awards at the IDIQ level to small businesses and additional awards may be made to large businesses.  Formal source selection procedures will apply.  Awardees will then be allowed to compete on individual Task Orders (TO) that are specific to individual DoD site(s) requirements.  Site requirements may include a primary base organization, other base organizations, and/or defined regions.  It is anticipated that the first TO will be for Tinker AFB (maintenance wing initially with potential expansion to other base organizations) and is expected to be awarded within five months of awarding the IDIQ contract.  Only those CMS providers who receive awards under the IDIQ contract will be allowed to compete for TOs.  The contract period for the IDIQ contract will include a 3 year base and two option periods; 3 and 4 years consecutively for a total of 10 years.  TOs may not exceed 5 years.  The CMS provider will be a single point of contact for all chemical requirements at a site/base and is responsible for performing chemical material support functions currently performed by site/base personnel.  Items typically covered in a CMS program are cataloged under, but are not limited to, Table I of Fed-Std-313C which includes the following Federal Supply Classes (FSC) containing hazardous materials:  4210, 4220, 6810, 6820, 6830, 6840, 6850, 6930, 7930, 8010, 8030, 8040, 9110, 9130, 9135, 9150, and 9160.  Other FSCs not listed in Table 1 which are considered hazardous material may be included.  The CMS provider may be responsible for any of the following:  1) demand analysis & forecasting, 2) purchasing of hazardous materials, 3) inventory management, 4) distribution to point of use (POU), 5) environmental health & safety (EH & S), waste collection, consolidation and disposal preparation, 6) continual improvement projects, and 7) information technology capability.  CMS transformation involves lean and cellular design whereby traditional large, chemical products and services are centralized and can be tailored to meet site specific requirements.  As part of a CMS objective, the service provider will manage chemical inventories so that a minimum quantity is on hand for customer bench stock and retail inventory is kept to a minimum as well.  Because of this transformation effort, the service provider will need to be responsive, agile, versatile, and reactive to a changing environment for chemical management support.  A copy of the solicitation and all other applicable information will be available at http://www.dscr.dla.mil/UserWeb/FAGA/CMS.htm.  The anticipated issue date is December 2006.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Marty Daugherty, 562-626-7368
<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment 01, synopsis solicitation N00244-07-T-0083 are to provide answers to questions and clarification to Statement of Work. Q1. The amount of available sunshine between winter and summer is dramatic.  Based on the para II, the system needs to provide approx 520 watt/hr for 12 hours per day, or approx 6240 watts per day.  In the winter, this latitude can expect 5-6 hours of usable sunshine and if we size the system for this extreme, then it gets quite large (and expensive). Should the system be sized for worst case scenario?  If not, what would be the usage?  e.g., 5 days/week, 52 weeks/year, etc. A1. Yes, size this for worst case scenario. Q1a. If the answer to Question (1) is yes, then the charge control is inadequate.  The amperages produce by the panels would exceed the controllers rated capacity.  Work around for this issue is to use more than one controller wired in parallel, would this be acceptable? A1a. Yes, more than one controller wired in parallel would be acceptable.  Recommend Wiring Diagrams be provided with proposal. Q2. Para III. C.2. states the charge controller will be installed in a Nema 4x type enclosure.  This method of mounting provides no means of allowing heat to disperse.  If the controller is to be located in the specified enclosure, should we design a modification to the enclosure to allow heat dispersal?  Or can the controller be mounted next to the inverter in the GFE equipment container? A2. A modification to the enclosure is acceptable, with still maintaining environmental integrity. Q3. In order to size the battery bank, how many days of battery backup are required?  Para III. A. mentions 7 days of autonomy, is this days of backup or without human intervention? A3. Without human intervention. Q4. Who supplies the equipment located between the contractor supplied inverter and the GFE loads.  If it is contractor supplied, besides a breaker panel for both the AC and DC loads, are receptacles required?  and if so what type? A4.  All other equipment after the supplied inverter will be GFE. Statement of Work, Paragraph III, Equipment Specifications, revised, in part, to read: "...NSWC COR will require three identical copies of each hardware package." The closing date and time remain unchanged.

<DESC>The Bureau of Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Access Board, is assessing the market to gain information about the procurement of a telephone services system to include a voice-over-internet protocol for the Washington, DC office.  This notice is not a solicitation, but an inquiry regarding the capabilities of telephone systems providers and a request for information from offerors who are willing and capable of providing a presentation regarding telephone system capabilities.  We are seeking information from, and will invite, potential vendors for presentations to be conducted at the Access Board based upon the responses we receive from this Request for Information.

Access Board Background
The Access Board is an independent Federal agency devoted to accessibility for people with disabilities. Created in 1973 to ensure access to federally funded facilities, the Access Board is now a leading source of information on accessible design. The Access Board develops and maintains design criteria for the built environment, transit vehicles, telecommunications equipment, and for electronic and information technology. It also provides technical assistance and training on these requirements and on accessible design and continues to enforce accessibility standards that cover federally funded facilities.

The Board is structured to function as a coordinating body among Federal agencies and to directly represent the public, particularly people with disabilities. Half of its members are representatives from most of the Federal departments. The other half is comprised of members of the public appointed by the President, a majority of who must have a disability.  The Board has a staff of about 30 people, and offices in commercial space in downtown Washington, DC.  As part of its legislative mandate, the Board sets the requirements for which electronic and information technology purchased by the Federal government must meet under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Any new phone system must comply with all the applicable requirements Section 508.  These requirements can be located at www.access-board.gov/508.htm. 

Telephone System Requirements
The Access Board is investigating the purchase of a new state-of-the-art telephone system.  The Access Board believes that the new system should feature voice-over-the-internet-protocol, but is willing to consider other options.  The Board is seeking an integrated telephone system, which includes unified messaging, TTY capabilities, including support for Voice Carry Over(VCO)/Hearing Carry Over(HCO) users.  In addition, an accessible integrated telephone system would provide universal access to all telephone functions and information (e.g., caller ID, directory of extensions, ability to mark a message urgent, call status, number of calls in queue, do not disturb, call-forward and other configurations.) The Access Board requires a vendor that can provide managed life cycle support for the Access Board?s telephone system infrastructure.

Current Access Board System Infrastructure
The Board currently operates and maintains a Siemens HICOM 150 H Office PRO with Xpression Unified Messaging. The switch interface type is BRI with 4 ports. The Board estimates a maximum of 40 desktop systems will be maintained under the potential resultant contract.

Requirements for Request for Information Response
Vendors interested in providing the Access Board with information for an appropriate telephone system should plan to present their product(s), capabilities and potential solutions in a product demonstration to the Access Board staff.  The product demonstrations will be conducted as follows:
?	The demonstration will be made at the Access Board?s office at 1331 F St. NW, Suite 1000, Washington DC and will not exceed two hours in length. Demonstrations may be scheduled between November 27, 2006 and 
December 8, 2006.  No extensions of this time period will be accepted.
?	The vendor will bring all

<DESC>Department of the Air Force, 21 CONS/LGCZB Operations and Maintenance Specialized Flight, 135 E. Ent Ave, Ste 105, Peterson AFB, CO, 80914-1385.  
Description:  This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This is not a request for proposal but a survey to locate potential sources to Operate, Maintain and Support the AN/FPS-133, Air Force Space Surveillance System (AFSSS).  The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 01 May 2007 and will include a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A best value source selection is anticipated as the method of contractor selection.  The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB) Colorado seeks potential sources to provide 24-hour-a-day, 7 day-a-week operations for each geographically separated unit meeting mission requirements and other specified lesser requirements in support of the 21st Space Wing, Operations Group.  The contractor shall be responsible to provide all labor support required to operate and maintain the nine AFSSS field stations located in Glennville GA, Hawkinsville GA, Hollandale MS, Lewisville AR, San Diego CA, Truth or Consequences NM, Wetumpa AL, Maricopa AZ, and Archer City, TX.  The AFSSS has been identified as a critical defense system and therefore, shall be manned on a 24 hour, 7 days-a-week, 365 days-a-year basis. Further, the contractor shall ensure that the contractor's personnel continue to operate and maintain this critical system in the event of a national emergency to include declared or undeclared state-of-war. The AFSSS stations are remotely located on a constant path across the southern United States from Georgia to California and consist of six receiver and three transmitter stations.  Energy emitted from the transmitter stations forms a fixed position, fan shaped beam very narrow in the north-south direction and extends across the continental United States in the east-west direction.

Martin, NSWC Crane, Code 0564, e-mail LogR&D@navy.mil, 812-854-3723.       Technical: Ken Burt, NSWC CRANE, Code 609, email LogR&D@navy.mil , 812-854-2139. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT 2005) requires aggressive actions throughout the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE) to reduce the existing dependency on fossil fuels and to initiate the transition toward alternative fuels and alternative fuel power sources.  EPACT 2005 goals require the DOD to reduce existing oil consumption rates 20% between 2006 and 2015, increase the use of renewable energy sources more than 7.5% by 2013, and explore unconventional fuel alternatives (synfuels and biofuels) to initiate the transition towards a future hydrogen economy.  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) are conducting research and development (R&D) and experimentation to advance the state of the art in manufacturing technologies and processes to increase the knowledge of and to help DOD meet EPACT 2005 goals and to complement the Presidentís hydrogen initiative.   DOD can contribute to the Presidentí!  s initiative by being a îfirst adopterî of hydrogen fuel cell technology when a strong case can be made that the technology benefits DOD militarily.  The funding allocated to this program is approximately $10 million.  Each program award is anticipated to be between $750,000 and $1.5 million excluding any proposed industry cost sharing.  The goal of this program is to conduct a DOD hydrogen (H2) fuel cell Materiel Handling Equipment (MHE) pilot program.   NSWC Crane is interested in receiving R&D proposals for scientific study and experimentation in the form of pilot projects directed toward advancing the state of the art or increasing knowledge or understanding in H2 powered MHE and the associated infrastructure. While this BAA will involve delivery of equipment and technology pilot testing for the purpose of data collection, the focus of this BAA is on the collection of operational data.  Successful proposals will include installation, maintenance and training associated with all equipment and hydrogen infrastructure needed to produce the required data for increasing DODís knowledge and understanding of the maturity of the technology. 1.	Conduct a DOD hydrogen (H2) fuel cell MHE pilot program ñ  1.1.	Background: DLA is DODís largest combat support agency, providing worldwide logistics support in both peacetime and wartime to the military services, civilian agencies and foreign countries. If Americaís forces eat it, wear it, maintain equipment with it, or burn it as fuelÖDLA probably provides it.  The Defense Distribution Center (DDC), a field organization of DLA, operates warehousing and cross-docking facilities for DOD.  The DDCís 26 Distribution Depots, located throughout the United States and around the world, store items having 4 million different stock numbers in 327 million square feet of storage space and process more than 26 million transactions annually.   In total, DLA operates over 3,000 forklifts, of which approximately half are electric-powered.  DLA has identified some of these electric-powered forklifts as targets of this pilot program.  Proposers are expected to offer at a minimum a complete power unit that is equivalent in form, fit, and function an!  d equal or superior in performance to the lead acid or nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery system currently used in these forklifts.  Other new and innovative approaches, including new forklifts designed for H2 fuel cell power, will be considered based on their contribution to the overall goals of this BAA.   1.2.	Goal Objectives:  The overarching objectives of this goal are to significantly increase the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) and Manufacturing Readiness Levels (MRLs) associated with the fuel cell systems and components and to produce business case data for future retrofitting or replacement of the existing forklift fleet with H2 fuel cell powered forklifts. For definitions of TRLs see http://akss.dau.mil/dag/GuideBook/IG_c10.5.2.asp and for MRLs see https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=18231.   1.2.1.1.	Any award made at any phase must demonstrate a number of contributions to the maturation of H2 fuel cell or infrastructure technology.   H2 Fuel cell technology includes fuel cell sub-systems and components (e.g., Membrane Exchange Assembly, power electronics, thermal management sub-system), and on-board H2 storage.  H2 infrastructure includes hydrogen delivery or onsite production, onsite storage, and dispensing technology or off-board H2 generation systems. Use of solid hydrogen storage medium is one specific area of interest for technology maturation efforts.  The improvements must be associated with the deployment and use schedule at the site of the proposed business data collection.  1.2.1.2.	The general nature of the improvements and the associated results obtained from the program will be documented and shared with selected industry and government personnel, subject to appropriate protections for proprietary information and other intellectual property.   1.2.2.	Business Case.  Additional sites may be included in the pilot program to generate business case data.  The business case will be built on data collected during the use of the H2-powered MHE in daily warehousing operations by in-place government personnel.   1.2.3.	This BAA initially solicits proposals for the first phase of this effort, a turnkey operation providing, and maintaining for two years, at least twenty H2-powered forklifts, including hydrogen consumed and the associated hydrogen support infrastructure, at the Defense Depot Susquehanna, PA (DDSP), located in New Cumberland, PA.  It is expected that DDSP personnel will, after appropriate training, operate the forklifts, including fueling them from a local H2 storage facility using a hydrogen dispenser located within the warehouse facility.  Proposals must address how the MHE will be provided, either by retrofit of existing equipment with H2 fuel cells that are form, fit and function replacements for sealed lead-acid batteries or by replacement with MHE specifically designed to be H2 powered, and how the H2 will be provided, stored, and dispensed to the MHE.  The contractor or contractor team will also need to obtain the necessary approvals and permits for all aspects o!  f the infrastructure and associated applications.  Proposals must also provide a plan for operator training for both MHE operation and refueling and for initial emergency response training for operators and local firefighting personnel related to MHE and infrastructure equipment.   1.2.4.	Subsequent phases of the effort will seek to establish a similar capability at additional DOD locations.  Additional pieces of H2-powered MHE will be retrofitted or supplied.   1.2.4.1.	Generation (either on- or off-site) of the H2 from renewable, non-hydrocarbon based sources is an additional topic of interest and encouraged in these later phases.   1.2.4.2.	Subsequent phases are expected to be at defense depots located in Tracy, CA, Norfolk, VA, San Diego, CA, Albany, GA, and Anniston AL.  Awards will be made in accordance with paragraph 2. below.   1.2.5.	Business case data will be collected by Government personnel or their representatives using, to the extent practical, automated capabilities provided by the company or companies supplying the fuel cells or the hydrogen fuel equipment for the pilot program (for example, using built-in test data collection capability for the H2 fuel cell).  This data will be used by the Government to decide the timing and extent of later phases of this project, and to what extent H2-powered MHE will be used in DDC operations.  The data will also be made available to other researchers and businesses, subject to appropriate protections for proprietary information and other intellectual property.   2.	Proposals will be evaluated and selections will be made in phases over the period of time the BAA is open.  Proposals for DDSP will be first and are due no later than 12/13/2006.  Additional locations will be identified as they become appropriate and will be announced by amendment to this BAA identifying the specific location.  Proposals for these additional locations will be due roughly 30 days from the date of each such BAA amendment with precise dates being set at the time the amendment is issued. Proposal selections are planned to be made over the subsequent 12 months at intervals of approximately 60 days as additional sites are identified and added by amendment to this BAA.  Offerors do not need to submit for DDSP if they are only interested in other locations/sites.  Due to the fast pace of H2 technology development, a separate proposal and selection will be conducted for each subsequent location.  Any and all awards are subject to availability of funding.   3.	There will be a pre-proposal conference and site visit for potential offerors on the below date. This pre-proposal conference and site visit will explain and clarify the objectives of this program and allow prospective offerors to view the DDSP site.  Government personnel will also respond to questions, but the information contained within this BAA or amendments to it take precedence over verbal responses.  Any questions or clarifications that result in material changes to this BAA will be addressed by a written amendment to the BAA.

Questions will be considered at any time prior to or during the conference. Responses to some questions may be incorporated in an amendment to this BAA.  The Government will not be liable for expenses incurred by an offeror prior to contract award. Offerors are cautioned that remarks and explanations provided at the conference shall not change the terms of this BAA unless the change(s) is amended in writing.    This notice constitutes a combined synopsis and Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR Part 6.102(d)(2). It is intended that this BAA be open until one year from its initial publication.  Proposals may be submitted by any non-governmental entity, including commercial firms, institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such concerns. NSWC Crane encourages participation by small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, HUBZone small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions. However, no part of this BAA is specifically reserved for these entities.  The following guidelines apply to all proposals. Typically each proposal may be funded incrementally for periods up to two years subject to the availability of appropriations.  Awards are expected to be between $750,000 and $1,500,000, with the size of each dependent upon the topic(s) (although NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds). More than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area, and deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation.  Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and cannot be considered for funding.  Additionally, studies and theoretical concepts that do not lead to implementation are specifically excluded.  All criteria set forth in FAR Part 35.016 are applicable. Proposals should be submitted in two sections: full technical and cost.  Technical and cost sections should be submitted as separate files.  Each proposal is limited to 35 pages, including attachments and supplementary material.  Proposals will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: a.	Overall relevance and scientific and technical merits of the proposed effort, including the plan and schedule for implementing the pilot programs, completeness of the data collection and comparison, and expected improvements in H2 fuel cell capability at the pilot programís completion; b.	Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed and the comprehensiveness of the technical data produced from the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted rights;  c.	The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the organization or consortia with H2 implementations and the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these critical to achieving the BAA objectives;  d.	The degree to which the proposed costs are reasonable and realistic and the quality, amount and extent of proposed cost share in the pilot programs. These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when taken together, are significantly more important than price, but evaluated prices or costs must be reasonable and realistic to enable the Government to make an award. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. Any responsible business may submit a proposal.   Please send proposals via e-mail to LogR&D@navy.mil. Please refer to BAA number N00164-07-R-6685 in all correspondence and communications.

<SUBJECT>80 -- Ultra-violet curable coatings applicable to aerospace applications
<SOLNBR>RFIPKWRM0001
<RESPDATE>121506
<ARCHDATE>12302006
<CONTACT>Julie Hoyt, Contract Negotiator, Phone 937-656-7488, Fax 937-656-7534, Email julie.hoyt@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>Request for Information
to
Manufacturers of Ultra-Violet Curable Coatings 


Intent
The United States Air Force (USAF) is seeking interested companies or organizations that have commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) UV curable coatings or experience in developing UV-curable coatings that would be applicable to aerospace applications.  The USAF is requesting this information in order to assess the current state of the UV-curable coatings and/or technologies in industry.

Background
Ultraviolet (UV)-curable coatings have been proven to have significant reductions in environmental impact (i.e., zero volatile organic compounds [VOCs]/hazardous air pollutants [HAPs]) and cost and cycle time over standard solvent-borne coatings.  There is interest in evaluating the applicability of these quick cure coatings for USAF aerospace and ground support equipment applications.  Potential users of the coatings would include Air Logistics Centers (ALCs), original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), front-line maintainers for repair applications, and numerous back-shop and OEM users for non-aircraft applications.  In response to the interest in UV coatings, the USAF has established a UV curable coating program.  

The objective of this UV-curable coating program is to identify, test, and evaluate UV-curable coating processes for coating operations conducted at USAF sites, in order to meet the following goals:

?	Reduce worker health and safety risks by reducing, eliminating, or improving the control of hazardous materials
?	Reduce or eliminate the generation of hazardous waste 
?	Reduce or eliminate the release of hazardous materials into the environment
?	Decrease or maintain life cycle costs related to current coating operations
?	Minimize maintenance requirements while increasing current production rates or part quality,
?	Increase aircraft availability and mission readiness by decreasing coating process flow times.


Baseline Performance Requirements
At this time, the USAF is interested in primers, topcoats, and/or single coat systems (a single coating that functions as both a primer and topcoat) that would be comparable to or better than the current traditional coating systems.  The primary tests that are of interest are flexibility, adhesion, fluid resistance, salt fog resistance, and weatherability.  The Military Specifications MIL-PRF-23377J, entitled ?Performance Specification, Primer Coatings: Epoxy, High-Solids,? and MIL-PRF-85285D, entitled ?Performance Specification, Coating: Polyurethane, Aircraft, and Support Equipment? will be referenced to be used as guidelines for performing the evaluation testing.  

Vendor Requirements
Potential coating manufacturers are being requested to demonstrate compliance and provide information to support ability to meet the following qualification criteria:

1.	Company background, qualification, experience with UV-cure coatings and coating systems.	
2.	Product description, application directions and method
3.	Market availability (ex. COTS or near-COTS)
4.	Willingness to provide coated samples for coating evaluation testing in accordance with a screening test plan developed using the guidelines of the military specifications referenced above.
5.	List of current end users of the products.
6.	Applicability to parts or components with complex geometries (something other than a flat panel).

This is not a request for proposal.  This is a market research tool that will be used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources.  Responses are requested within thirty (30) days from the publication of this notice. 

Contact Information
Information should be sent to Ms. Cristina Bressler or Ms. Heather Rachocki, Concurrent Technologies Corporation, 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA  15904 or emailed to bressler@ctc.com or rachockh@ctc.com.  Technical questions can be directed to Ms. Bressler at 814-269-2863 or Ms. Rachocki at 814-269-2584.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-Picatinny, Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce in support of the U.S. Army Research Development Engineering Command ‚Äì  Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (RDECOM-ARDEC) is  conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources that are capable of  lightweight modular composite armor made up of advanced materials providing a  very high level of protection for use in civilian vehicles. These lightweight  advanced composite armor tiles are to be installed into civilian vehicles  through the use of brackets and an installation kits without any major  modification to the vehicle. These kits are to be installed by soldiers in the  field with tools on hand at the user and mechanic level, not factory  installed. The tiles are to be design in a modular fashion allowing for  soldiers to quickly switch out specific panels that may be damaged through  regular wear and tear use as well as from sustaining combat damage. The armor  and kits are to be designed to protect vehicle passengers from enemy small  arms fire and from potential damage sustained from anti-personnel mines.  Vehicle solutions are to include both non-transparent and transparent (glass)  armor material solutions. Kits are not to significantly detract from the  vehicle‚Äôs capability to drive, operate, and handle in a safe manor. The armor  Kits should not increase the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR)) significantly  which can cause excessive wear and tear of any major components that would  render the vehicle ineffective or unsafe. Kits are to be designed in a  modular, scaleable and adaptive  fashion allowing for the same panels and  brackets to be used in numerous and multiple different civilian vehicles.  Examples of potential vehicle applications are the Chevrolet Suburban, large  and medium luxury sedans, Toyota trucks, Nissan trucks, multiple versions of  SUV and truck utility type vehicles, and small and medium Toyota and BMW type  sedans. Maximum modularity, compatibility and similarity between kits, tiles,  and components among the different vehicle applications is highly desired.  Primary protection areas are to be focused on and highest in the passenger and  crew compartment area, with a secondary capability to expand to the vehicle  engine and cargo area. The information must be submitted in the form of a  brochure within 30 calendar days from the date of this publication to: Lance P.

Specifically, when administered following exposure to ionizing radiation, the products should either prevent/reduce the extent of incipient radiation injury or promote repair of manifest radiation injury to allow preservation/restoration of t he anatomic integrity and normal physiologic functioning of the GI tract.  A Prime Contractor will be responsible for conducting the advanced development activities and selecting and managing subcontractors capable of conducting various activities associat ed with drug development in manners that are consistent with eventual approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Depending on the technical maturity of the proposed technology, activities may include process development and related tasks, cu rrent Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)-compliant small-scale manufacturing and testing of the product, Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)-compliant acute toxicology testing in animals, filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, Phase 1 clinic al studies conducted in accordance with FDA Good Clinical Practices (GCP) regulations and guidelines, follow-on clinical studies, and definitive animal studies (assumes use of the FDA 'Animal Rule' 21 CFR 314.600 Subpart I) and appropriate non-clinical stu dies leading to eventual FDA approval of the product.  MITS anticipates that the Prime Contractor will file the New Drug Application (NDA) and hold the license for the product. These therapeutic products are being developed in response to a requirement to treat service members for the effects of radiation injury and to allow commanders to sustain and continue operations in the event of nuclear or radiological attacks on U.S. Forces.  Prospective products should have substantiated in vivo safety and efficacy  data that clearly demonstrate the potential for further development into a FDA approved drug/biologic. This is not a request for competitive proposals, however, parties interested in responding must furnish, in writing, a 1-2 page synopsis of their candid ate which clearly supports its therapeutic potential. The inclusion of in vivo data in the synopsis is encouraged.  Any information received in response to this Sources Sought Notice that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly. This information may be submitted via mail, e-mail, or fax.  All responses are to be submitted by no later than December 1, 2006 by 4:00 pm EST in order to be accepted for review.  All paperwork must be sent to U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, ATTN: Shelley Mar ken, 64 Thomas Johnson Drive, Frederick, MD 21702, Fax (301)619-5069 or by e-mail to shelley.marken@det.amedd.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>R -- Student Inquiries
<DESC>Operational Contracting, US Air Force Academy intends to award a sole source purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures to The Princeton Review Inc for purchase of lists of diversity students interested in the United States Air Force Academy through the Princeton Review Initiated Student Match (PRISM) program.

Princeton Review is the only source for the specific match of qualified diversity students who are interested in an engineering or military school.  These students are not random names to be purchased but students that come to us qualified with interest and are cleared by PRISM.
 Supplies and/or services are available from only one responsible source.   No other type of supply or service will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet this requirement.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  If no response is received by November 21, 2006 to the effect that comparable supplies and/or services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these supplies and or services though a sole source procurement with The Princeton Review a sole source award will be made.

This solution will provide one of the major components required for a robust, fully functioning, and enterprise-scale Enterprise Services Bus.

Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentís requirements as a key component of the Departmentís information sharing requirements. The Oracle Internet Application Server, Enterprise Edition has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.

PROMPT PAYMENT TERMS

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS

A. Systems Submission of Invoices. 

 Invoice submission is a two step process:

The Vendor shall develop an Acceptance Information document in IT Solutions Shop (ITSS) and attach a copy of invoice with all required back-up documentation.

     Current ITSS web site https://it-solutions.gsa.gov

The Vendor shall also complete the invoice form on the Finance web site and attach soft copy of invoice.  This is the official system of record; the invoice will not be processed for payment unless this process is completed.  

     Current General Services Administration (GSA) Finance web site is www.finance.gsa.gov.  Go to
    http://finance.gsa.gov/password/ to obtain Password/Sign-Up for Email Notification.

B. Invoice Submission Process.

?	Submit each invoice only once.  Submitting multiple copies confuses and delays processing.

?	If editing is required, update the first submission; don?t create a second invoice submission.

?	Make sure the invoice amount and the acceptance document amount are the same.

?	Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Don?t use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

?	Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

?	If an invoice is rejected, a corrected invoice will be submitted using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. ?R? to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

?	In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice. This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

?	Invoice must be submitted in ITSS on Acceptance Information document and include copy of invoice and required back-up attached.

C. Timing of invoices.

Invoices shall be submitted for payment of deliverables that have been completed and accepted by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).

For Firm Fixed Price (FFP), this will be a completed and accepted deliverable.  Evidence that the COR accepted the deliverable must be present before the GSA Project Manager (PM) can proceed.  Ensure the invoice is submitted in accordance with the established payment schedule.  

For Time and Material (T&M), this will be a month?s worth of services.  The COR will certify that the contractor has performed in accordance with the statement of work and the government has received the hours and/or materials billed by the contractor.  Ensure the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, are fully complied with.  GSA PM will certify the invoice for payment.

D. Payment of Invoices.

Payment of invoices shall be based on the quality of the invoiced deliverable.  If the invoiced deliverable does not meet the established contractual standards, the invoice will not be paid until the deliverable has been determined to meet the established standards, as applicable.

	The contractor is reminded that invoices will be submitted In accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions ? Commercial Items, paragraph g, which states the following:

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS

A. Systems Submission of Invoices. 

 Invoice submission is a two step process:

The Vendor shall develop an Acceptance Information document in IT Solutions Shop (ITSS) and attach a copy of invoice with all required back-up documentation.

     Current ITSS web site https://it-solutions.gsa.gov

The Vendor shall also complete the invoice form on the Finance web site and attach soft copy of invoice.  This is the official system of record; the invoice will not be processed for payment unless this process is completed.  

     Current General Services Administration (GSA) Finance web site is www.finance.gsa.gov.  Go to
    http://finance.gsa.gov/password/ to obtain Password/Sign-Up for Email Notification.

B. Invoice Submission Process.

?	Submit each invoice only once.  Submitting multiple copies confuses and delays processing.

?	If editing is required, update the first submission; don?t create a second invoice submission.

?	Make sure the invoice amount and the acceptance document amount are the same.

?	Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Don?t use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

?	Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

?	If an invoice is rejected, a corrected invoice will be submitted using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. ?R? to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

?	In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice. This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

?	Invoice must be submitted in ITSS on Acceptance Information document and include copy of invoice and required back-up attached.

C. Timing of invoices.

Invoices shall be submitted for payment of deliverables that have been completed and accepted by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).

For Firm Fixed Price (FFP), this will be a completed and accepted deliverable.  Evidence that the COR accepted the deliverable must be present before the GSA Project Manager (PM) can proceed.  Ensure the invoice is submitted in accordance with the established payment schedule.  

For Time and Material (T&M), this will be a month?s worth of services.  The COR will certify that the contractor has performed in accordance with the statement of work and the government has received the hours and/or materials billed by the contractor.  Ensure the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, are fully complied with.  GSA PM will certify the invoice for payment.

D. Payment of Invoices.

Payment of invoices shall be based on the quality of the invoiced deliverable.  If the invoiced deliverable does not meet the established contractual standards, the invoice will not be paid until the deliverable has been determined to meet the established standards, as applicable.

	The contractor is reminded that invoices will be submitted In accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions ? Commercial Items, paragraph g, which states the following:

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except

`at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of
section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign
corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an
inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?

properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the
properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when
determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted

I.  GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

The Police Liaison Officer (PLO) reports to the Department of State?s Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) and United States Office in Pristina (USOP) to assist in the development, implementation, and management of U.S. foreign policy regarding the continued successful deployment of U.S. Civilian Police (CIVPOL) assigned to the police component of United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), and the training, equipping, and continued development of the newly established Kosovo Police Service (KPS).  When the mission transfers to the European Union (EU), the PLO will serve the same functions with respect to that mission.  The PLO frequently meets with members of the international community, including police and non-police assigned to UNMIK, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), EU, KFOR (the NATO military force in Kosovo), and various non-governmental organizations (NGO?s) for the purpose of gathering and disseminating information pertinent to CIVPOL, KPS, and the overall international effort directed at Kosovo law enforcement development.  The PLO is frequently required to attend emergency action committee meetings at USOP and render opinions of overall mission security based on sources such as reporting by relevant UNMIK police authorities.  

Background

Since 1999, INL has managed CIVPOL and local police development programs in Kosovo.  The program currently costs approximately $30 million a year.  The primary program elements include 1) U.S. contribution of American police (currently approximately 220 officers) to the civilian police component of the United Nations Mission (UNMIK).  UNMIK Police are responsible for law enforcement functions in Kosovo until the new police force is established and prepared to assume responsibility for law enforcement throughout Kosovo; 2) logistical, medical and administrative support for U.S. CIVPOL is provided by the Department of State contractor, Civilian Police International (CPI), from building complexes in Pristina and the four outlying regions ; 3) U.S. contribution of trainers (approximately 7) and academy director to support the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) effort to train some 7,300 members of the new Kosovo Police Service (KPS) at the police academy; 4) U.S. donation of police equipment, supplies and materials via the contractor, CPI; 5) U.S. contribution of two American attorneys to provide advice, guidance and training in the specialized area of criminal codes and associated legal procedures; and 6) U.S. support to the UNMIK Police intelligence and investigative units.  After transition to an EU mission, it is anticipated that only a small number of international civpol officers will retain executive powers, and the remainder will serve as mentors/advisors to the KPS.  It is expected to remain an armed mission.  The management of this complex program and its importance to U.S. foreign policy goals requires a full-time person with significant police expertise to monitor and troubleshoot the day-to-day aspects of the program.

Project Title
Coast Guard Technical Information Management System (CG-TIMS); Technical documentation management is an essential component in ensuring that the Coast Guard is successful at optimizing the operational effectiveness and suitability of our cutters, aircraft, electronic systems and facilities.  Coast Guard Civil Engineering, Coast Guard Yard, Naval Engineering, Electronics, and Aviation Engineering communities currently use different and separate Technical Information Management Systems (TIMS) to find, manage, track, and control access to their electronic data and documents. The CG-TIMS Project will consolidate these TIMS into a single COTS product.
Background
The Logistics Management Transformation Integration Office is developing the business process framework for the single, integrated, enterprise level logistics system.   In today?s Coast Guard, we have many logistics information management systems that provide the same capabilities for different platforms.  These systems create layers of redundant capabilities for logistics information management. As part of the logistics transformation effort, these capabilities will be consolidated into a single set of IT tools, using the aviation community?s business processes as a benchmark.  

The Coast Guard requires one solution that will meet the technical information management needs of the entire Coast Guard. The vision is to unify disparate technical data into one centralized database called the Coast Guard Technical Information Management System (CG-TIMS).  CG-TIMS will manage all technical information management systems across all communities, creating an enterprise level logistics system.
Scope
Synergis Adept is the system of choice to manage the Coast Guard?s Technical documentation and has been selected as the COTS product behind CG-TIMS.  Adept was first used by the Coast Guard Civil Engineering community in 1993 and was certified by TISCOM in 1998. Adept is currently available on the Engineering Workstation Image.  

The applications for which the CG-TIMS project will consolidate technical data are: Coast Guard Planned Maintenance Systems (CGPMS), Hull Mechanical and Electrical (HM&E) PMS Tool, A-TIMS, NE-TIMS and CE-TIMS. The consolidation of these existing TIMS systems into a COTS solution will create a single repository for Coast Guard technical data. 

The scope of work performed during the stated period of performance includes data migration and support from legacy NE-TIMS naval and electronics data into Adept and the maintenance and support of the Adept application and unique extensions in the Coast Guard.
Specific Tasks
NE-TIMS Data Migration - Migrate NE-TIMS data into the CG-TIMS per the approved specification. Provide support post migration electronic and naval data by making modifications of relationships, metadata, workflow, libraries, and library cards per the approved modified specification.

Annual Maintenance Agreement of Adept Oracle Version - Annual Maintenance Includes what was previously known as Annual Subscription and Annual Support Price per seat - Includes All Upgrades and Updates to core Adept Software and Off the Shelf Extensions and includes unlimited telephone, web and email support for one year.

Annual Maintenance for CG-TIMS-Specific Adept Extensions - Includes upgrades and updates to CGTIMS specific Adept custom extensions enabling them to work with new versions of Adept.  Annual Maintenance also includes unlimited telephone, web and email support for these extensions.
Government Acceptance
COTR acceptance must be obtained for each deliverable under this task.  Once each deliverable has been provided to the Government and has successfully passed operational testing, or upon receipt of a software maintenance plan, the COTR will provide documentation (electronic mail is acceptable) stating approval of the deliverable. 
Travel
Contractor travel will be required to support this task order.  All travel required by the Government outside the local commuting area will be reimbursed to the Contractor in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations.  Travel shall include, but is not limited to, airfare, per diem, and rental vehicles.  Profit will not be paid on travel.  The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining COTR approval (electronic mail is acceptable) for all reimbursable travel in advance of each travel event.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a  Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to provide support for the DOC/NOAA's Office of Atmospheric Research, Air Resources Laboratory of the Atmospheric Integrated Research Monitoring Network (AIRMoN) through analysis of precipitation samples.  A precipitation chemistry database consisting of major ION data from all analyzed samples, as well as routine supporting information such as sample dates and precipitation depths will be provided.  

The scope is monitoring precipitation chemistry on a daily basis according to the methods specified by the AIRMoN Central Analytical Laboratory located in Champaign, IL.  The following are the efforts required for this acquisition:  Routine (at least weekly) maintenance of Aerochem Metrics precipitation collector and official recording gages; Collection of all precipitation samples on a daily basis, 365 days per year;  Analysis of conductivity and pH for all precipitation samples with greater than 50 ml volume; Packaging and shipping of samples to the Central Analytical Laboratory according to AIRMoN protocols at least once per week; Participation in AIRMoN program development efforts through telephone conference calls or formal meetings.  Participation in special field studies.  These studies are occasionally required to test proposed sampling protocol modifications.  

In 1991, the Air Resources Laboratory assumed control of the MAP3S network.  The station at Lewes, Delaware remains as one of the longest continuously monitoring sensitive ecosystem stations in the nation and has contributed greatly to the knowledge base regarding eutrophication of coastal resources and metals loadings to the mid-Atlantic region.  AIRMoN consists of a network designed to determine the effectiveness of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments in reducing sulfur deposition and to address regional source-receptor issues.  The west deposition segment of the AIRMoN program is structured to answer many of the questions originally contemplated by MAP3S and mandated for NOAA to study as part of the Clean Air Act and subsequent legislation addressing air pollution agricultural emissions.  The Lewes station is a critical member of the AIRMoN precipitation network.  All approved protocols must be met and include routine maintenance and troubleshooting requirements.  

The period of performance is expected to be twenty-four (24) months, with an estimated price of $48,000.00.  Performance is expected to begin on or about January 1, 2007. 

The resulting purchase order shall be negotiated on a firm-fixed price basis.  The award shall be made on a best value basis. Offers will be evaluated based upon approach, past performance and price.  While these factors are relatively equal, they are listed in order of importance.  An annual Final Report shall be delivered to NOAA which contains the analysis of the precipitation samples and a chemistry database consisting of major ion data from all analyzed sample dates and precipitation depths.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and the solicitation number is SP3100-07-T-0022.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-13 effective 28 Sept. 2006 and DFARS DCN 20061026 edition.

The requirement consists of the following:

NOTICE TO DLA SUPPLIERS: New DOD requirements for wood packaging material (WPM) have been developed in response to international implementation of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization protocol on International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) 15. ISPM 15 is designed to block movement of pests that can destroy forests from one nation to another. DOD shipments inside and outside of the United States must meet ISPM 15 whenever WPM is used to ship DOD cargo. (For more information, see the American Lumber Standard Committee, Incorporated Web page at http://www.alsc.org ). The new WPM requirements will be reflected in DLA solicitations issued on or after August 1, 2006. WPM is defined in the clause at DLAD 52.247-9012, Requirements for Treatment of Wood Packaging Material. (Note that DOD does not endorse the Methyl Bromide Fumigation Program. Only heat treatment or kiln dried heat treatment of WPM are authorized.) When a contract includes the clause at DLAD 52.247-9012, contractors can be held accountable for taking corrective action on noncompliant shipments. END OF NOTICE

<DESC>BRIEF BACKGROUND

UNAIDS estimates that there are almost two million adults and children living with HIV infection in Latin America and the Caribbean, of whom almost 700,000 are women of childbearing age and children (numbers that are generally regarded as underestimates).  In 2005, fewer that 65,000 adults and children were newly infected with HIV in North America, as compared with almost 180,000 adults and children in Latin American and Caribbean nations.  Lastly, while 73% of all people requiring antiretroviral therapy in Latin America are receiving it, only approximately 8% of children are receiving antiretrovirals and almost 3,000 children in these countries died of AIDS in 2005. 

The epidemiology of perinatal HIV infection has markedly changed over the years with implementation of interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV, i.e., antiretroviral prophylaxis, cesarean delivery before labor and before rupture of membranes, and complete avoidance of breastfeeding.  Use of highly active combination antiretroviral regimens to treat HIV disease has significantly decreased morbidity and prolonged the life of infected individuals, and when used by HIV-infected pregnant women, may further decrease the risk of mother-to-child transmission.   However, many questions remain. For example, the safety of exposure to combination antiretroviral regimens in pregnant women and their uninfected children, and the long-term effects of potent combination antiretroviral therapy on HIV-infected infants, children, and women, needs to be better defined.  

The goals of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development?s (NICHD) research on pediatric HIV infection include development of improved interventions for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, as well as improved treatment of HIV infection and its sequelae in infants, children, adolescents, pregnant women and mothers. NICHD has funded a NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Perinatal HIV Clinical Studies Network Coordinating Center to coordinate clinical studies related to HIV infection in these populations.  Westat , a contract research organization located in Rockville, Maryland, U.S.A, has served as this Coordinating Center for over 15 years.  The Coordinating Center has funded a network of clinical sites in the U.S. and other countries enrolling subjects in trials related to preventing and treating HIV infection and its complications in neonates, infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women.  The network has included sites in the U.S. and more recently, international sites.

Additionally, over the previous 5 years, NICHD has asked the Coordinating Center to expand its international collaborations in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean through funding of two prospective cohort studies in the NICHD International Site Development Initiative (?NISDI?) project, which began enrollment in 2002.  One study enrolled HIV-infected pregnant women and followed these women and their HIV-exposed infants until six months after delivery/birth (the 

NISDI Perinatal study).  Another study enrolled HIV-exposed and HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents (the NISDI Pediatric study).  

The new NISDI studies will be prospective cohort studies of two different populations: 

Protocol I: a perinatal study to collect data regarding HIV-infected pregnant women through 6 months postpartum and HIV-exposed, uninfected children for up to 5 years of follow up.

Protocol II: a pediatric study to collect data on HIV vertically-infected children less than or equal to 5 years of age (up to 5 years and 364 days old) for up to 5 years of follow up.

The conduct of these prospective, multicenter, observational studies of HIV-infected pregnant women and their HIV-exposed but uninfected children (Protocol I) and of HIV-infected children (Protocol II) at sites in Latin America and the Caribbean will provide critical data about the demographic, clinical, immunologic and virologic characteristics of these populations.  In addition, such studies will provide information about the safety of antiretroviral drugs or other therapies among HIV-infected pregnant women and children and about the safety of in utero and early postnatal exposure to antiretrovirals by HIV-exposed but uninfected children. 

As the NICHD Coordinating Center, Westat's role includes negotiating and managing budgets and subcontracts with clinical centers, participating in protocol and forms development, training clinical center staff, site monitoring, data processing, data analysis, and manuscript preparation.  The NICHD Coordinating Center will serve as the coordinating center for the observational studies to be conducted as specified in this RFP. 

GOALS/RESEARCH OBJECTIVES  

The overall goal of this initiative is to describe HIV-infected pregnant women, HIV-exposed, uninfected children, and HIV-infected children at clinical centers in Latin America and the Caribbean.  Please refer to the attached Abstracts I and II for more specific information regarding these two research studies.  Sites will have the option of proposing to participate in either one or both of these studies. Sites currently participating in the NISDI protocols must reapply to this RFP in order to be eligible to participate in these studies. If sites choose to propose to participate in both studies, only one proposal needs to be submitted to cover both studies. 

NOTICE OF INTENT TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL
Interested institutions are requested to complete the Notice of Intent to Submit a Proposal form which is included in the RFP and return it by e-mail or fax to Steven Sokolowski at the address listed on the form by 5:00 p.m. U.S. Eastern Standard Time (USA) on Friday, December 15, 2006.  Although the Notice of Intent is not required, is not binding, and is not part of the review of a subsequent proposal, the information that it contains allows Westat staff to estimate the potential review work involved and avoid conflict of interest in the review process.

<DESC>BRIEF BACKGROUND 

Since 1992, Westat, a contract research organization located in Rockville, Maryland, has served as the coordinating center for the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Pediatric and Perinatal HIV Studies Network under contract to NICHD.  The coordinating center subcontracts with clinical sites to form the multi-center NICHD Pediatric and Perinatal HIV Studies Network.  This Network consists of domestic and international clinical sites that conduct clinical studies related to treatment and prevention of HIV infection and its complications in infants, children, adolescents and pregnant women, observational HIV studies and selected clinical trials of gender-specific manifestations of HIV infection in non-pregnant women.
 

Clinical studies are conducted within the NICHD Network primarily but not solely in collaboration with the International Maternal, Pediatric, and Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Group funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and NICHD.  The IMPAACT Scientific committees, in conjunction with the Network Executive Committee (NEC), set the scientific agenda for therapeutic research in children and pregnant women in the U.S. and abroad.  These Committees consist of investigators from IMPAACT, NIAID- and NICHD-funded HIV clinical trials sites, and staff from DAIDS/NIAID and PAMA/NICHD. Additionally, NICHD has developed collaborations outside of IMPAACT such as with the Pediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA), HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), and the Adolescent Trials Network (ATN) to permit the addition of special expertise to answer specific research questions.  


Westat and the Network have participated in over 120 multi-center phase I through IV clinical trials in HIV-exposed and infected infants, and HIV-infected children, adolescents, and pregnant and non-pregnant women.  The current coordinating center contract expires October 31, 2007. Westat has been directed by NICHD to conduct a competitive solicitation of clinical sites for participation in the Network in anticipation that NICHD will continue to support the network of clinical centers in the conduct of HIV studies in these populations.

As the demographics of pediatric and maternal HIV infection have changed over time, the NICHD Network has expanded and modified the number and type of clinical trials sites that form the Network as well as the types of studies being done within the Network.  Initially under this contract, the Network sites included a specialized obstetric component for the conduct of perinatal trials. In 1996 there was a competitive solicitation for new sites with an emphasis on sites with large pediatric/maternal populations that did not have access to clinical trials, and in 1997 the entire NICHD Network underwent a review prior to the coordinating contract recompetition.  In recognition of the global nature of the pediatric and maternal HIV epidemic, the NICHD began an international expansion in 1998 in mid-developing countries in the Caribbean and Latin America, funding 5 sites in Brazil and 1 in the Bahamas.  In 2002, all domestic NICHD-funded clinical sites were recompeted.  Currently, the domestic Network consists of 29 centers located in 18 cities in 11 states/territories (including Puerto Rico). 


This Westat-initiated RFP intends to evaluate domestic and international sites for the NICHD Pediatric and Perinatal HIV Studies Network.  Current sites that wish to continue participation in the NICHD Network under the new NICHD contract and potential new sites that have evidence of prior participation in NIH sponsored HIV clinical research studies such as Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trial Group (PACTG)/IMPAACT, NICHD International Site Development Initiative (NISDI), ATN, HPTN perinatal studies (including HPTN040) and Comprehensive International Program of Research on AIDS (CIPRA) studies may respond to this RFP.  Clinical sites participate in the Network as subcontractors to the prime contractor.  They are funded through a fixed price budget that is negotiated annually based on the actual and projected numbers of subjects to be enrolled in protocols and the work to be performed.


GOALS/RESEARCH OBJECTIVES  

The primary goals of the NICHD Pediatric and Perinatal HIV Studies Network and this RFP include:
? Evaluating and developing improved interventions to further reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission, particularly for women who are identified very late in pregnancy or at labor and therefore have not received antiretrovirals;
? Evaluating the pharmacokinetics and safety of antiretroviral drugs in pregnant, infected women and their neonates, including metabolic and short- and long-term effects of exposure on the women and their infants;
? Identifying optimal strategies for timing therapy initiation in antiretroviral-na?ve infants, children, and adolescents; determining when to change therapy in those who are antiretroviral-experienced; and finding optimal treatments for those failing therapy;
? Identifying therapies that improve the clinical status, quality of life, and survival of HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents at all stages of disease, from early asymptomatic infection to end-stage AIDS, including antiretroviral drugs, therapies aimed at reconstitution, and use of therapeutic HIV vaccines;
? Identifying therapies or prophylactic regimens that prevent or mitigate the development of serious sequelae of pediatric and adolescent HIV infection, including opportunistic infections, growth abnormalities, neurologic /neurodevelopmental impairments and other complications;
? Evaluating the long-term impact of antiretroviral therapy on HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents, including morbidity and survival, with a particular emphasis  on metabolic toxicities;
? Identifying and evaluating gender-specific manifestations of HIV and identifying therapies to treat women-specific manifestations in HIV-infected, non-pregnant women; and
? Evaluating the pathogenesis of HIV disease in children and women, and that of perinatal transmission in the context of clinical trials.

partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in
the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not
have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of
which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of
such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when
determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted
domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity
as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining
ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign
incorporated entity; or
 (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition
described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C.
395(b)(1).

control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall

(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some internal forums.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>THIS AMENDMENT INCORPORATES CHANGES TO THE STATEMENT OF WORK/ SPECIFICATIONS AND EXTENDS THE DUE DATE UNTIL APRIL 27, 2006. ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS REAMAIN UNCHANGED.

THE FOLLOWING CHANGES ARE INCORPORATED:

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES IN ìSOW_scattered_beam_PG_filter_v2c_AMD-1 CB.docî 

Overall description of changes: 
The requirement on mosaic has been tightened from 15 degrees as measured with 11.6 meV neutrons to 7 degrees for 14.7 meV neutrons
The minimum transmission requirement has been changed from 80 percent at 11.6 meV to 65 percent at 14.7 meV. Because of the specific nature of neutron transmission through graphite both of these changes imply stricter requirements on the materials quality. 
 
Specific edits:
