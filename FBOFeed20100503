<DESC>Presolicitation Synopsis
<p>T-38 Prefabricated Aircraft Shelters<br />Solicitation Number: FA3020-10-R-0028<br />Agency: Department of the Air Force<br />Office: Air Education and Training Command<br />Location: Sheppard AFB Contracting Office</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: <br />FA3020-10-R-0028 <br />Notice Type: <br />Presolicitation <br />Synopsis: <br />May 03, 2010 4:15 pm</p>
<p>The 82d Contracting Squadron, Sheppard Air Force Base, Wichita Falls, Texas is synopsizing this requirement for a contractor to provide all materials, equipment, transportation, labor, and supervision necessary to manufacture and install 9 rows of prefabricated STEEL aircraft shelters, 6 shelters per row. Each shelter must accommodate 2 aircraft per shelter (12 aircraft per row) to cover 108 T-38 aircraft parking spaces, located on the 80th Flying Training Wing Aircraft Parking Apron. NOTE: Aluminum framed and fabric covered shelters are not acceptable. <br />This announcement constitutes the only synopsis. This requirement is a 100% Set Aside for Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) concerns. The resultant contract will be a Firm-Fixed Price commercial contract. The North American Industrial Classification Code is 332311 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. Performance period will be 240 days after award of the contract.<br />Davis Bacon (FAR 22.403-1) and Berry Amendment (DFAR 252.225-7014) rules apply for this acquisition. Offerors will be required to provide certification of compliance with the Berry Amendment. Violation of the Berry Amendment constitutes a potential violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act.<br />In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to a responsible offeror, whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. Best value means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. In determining the best value, the government shall consider Price and Past Performance. NOTE: Past performance will be significantly more important than Price when being evaluated. Past performance questionnaire submissions will be required before the due date of the proposal. The government will query past performance references submitted. Offerors will be required to provide past performance questionnaire submissions from at least five (5) and no more than seven (7) relevant contracts, from different customers, performed for other Federal agencies or commercial agencies within the last three (3) years. Relevant past performance information includes an effort that is essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities as this solicitation requires. Relevancy will be further defined in the solicitation.<br />Funds are not currently available for this solicitation. Award as a result of this solicitation is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds. There shall be no legal liability on the part of the Government for contract purposes until funds are made available to the contracting officer. The contracting officer will confirm availability of funds in writing to the contractor upon award. The Government reserves the right to award all or a portion of this requirement. Prospective contractors are cautioned to closely review the Schedule Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINS) on the solicitation as they contain multiple timelines and options for pricing. As a result of this option pricing structure, the Government will not provide a price adjustment if material and/or shipping cost change between the award date and the start date of the contract. Therefore, offerors shall take this into consideration when submitting their proposal.<br />A formal site visit will be conducted. A Pre-Site Visit Conference Meeting will be held at the Sheppard AFB Base Contracting Office Auditorium, Bldg 1664, 136 K Ave, Suite 1. This meeting will provide an overview of the project and will allow for accountability and transportation arrangements (Government Bus) to the project site. The aircraft shelter installation area is within a designated Sheppard AFB controlled area, therefore all site visit attendees will require physical escort to the project area. Privately owned vehicles will not be allowed on the aircraft parking apron. Site visit and conference meeting dates/times will be finalized in the solicitation. NOTE: The government will not accept questions regarding the site visit and technical specification requirements after the date specified in the solicitation; therefore, attendance is at the contractor's discretion and expense. The government will not reimburse attendees for travel expenses.<br />All information required for submission of an offer will be identified in the Request for Proposal (RFP). Interested parties must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) as prescribed in DFARS 252.204-7004. CCR can be accessed at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx or by calling 1-866-606-8220. The CCR registration must be completed before award can be made. All prospective offerors interested in submitting a proposal must have a commercial and government entity code. The anticipated issue date of solicitation is on or about 18 May 2010. The RFP will be issued electronically and may be accessed and downloaded at the following web address: http://www.fbo.gov/. NO HARD COPIES will be provided by the issuing office. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for updates or amendments to any and all documents. All responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by this Agency. Proposal submission due date will be finalized in the solicitation</p>

<DESC>This synopsis is for a noncommercial engineering effort for the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U. S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center, ATTN. CCAM-RDT, 401 Lee Blvd., Ft. Eustis, Virginia 23604-5 577. POC Ms Sandra Schuck, Contract Specialist, 757-878-4819.  The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals to conduct a 6.2 Research & Development program as described below.  Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein.  This Broad Agency Announcement constitutes the total solicitation.  There will be no other solicitation issued in regard to this requirement.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may permit extensions to the proposal submission date.  This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs.  No pre-proposal conference is to be held.<BR>INTRODUCTION The Army desires to transition its aviation fleet to Condition Based Maintenance (CBM), as directed by the DoD Logistics Transformation Strategy and the Army CBM Plus Plan. This BAA is responsive to the Armys plan to mature embedded diagnostics and prognostics for CBM. Current maintenance is reactive to faults, not proactive, resulting in an excessive logistics support burden and high operations and sustainment (O&S) costs. The Army science and technology (S&T) goal to decrease O&S cost by reducing maintenance supports this transition to CBM.  The Operations Support and Sustainment Technologies Phase II (OSST-II) program will develop and demonstrate diagnostic, prognostic, and system health assessment technologies to support the Army goal and enable transition to a CBM based philosophy. Specific OSST-II objectives are reduction of inspections and preventative maintenance, expansion of serviceability criteria, extension of life or time between overhaul, and prediction of failure with sufficient fidelity to allow scheduling of maintenance. Many technical opportunities exist to enable implementing condition based maintenance; however there are several key technical challenges. High fault detection accuracy needs to be achieved with minimal false alarms. A wide range of aircraft components and failure modes need to be monitored with limited sensor data and a minimal weight penalty. Accurate estimates of remaining useful life for components across varying usage and environment are required. Open systems architecture and use of common data standards are required. Aircraft integration of on-board data collection, processing, and storage shall be considered. This program will result in a series of technologies that can be transitioned to support the implementation of CBM. For this program transition is defined as the continuation of technology development through a future Advanced Technology Demonstration for potential fielding on current and future Army rotorcraft. This OSST-II BAA is limited to 6.2 Applied Research. Efforts under this BAA will develop and mature promising technologies that enable an assessment of health or integrity obtained from sensors and other data sources to improve diagnostics and prognostics capabilities. Through this effort, technologies are expected to be matured to a TRL 4 (Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment). Testing shall be conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of developed technologies. A follow-on competitive 6.3 effort to continue development and demonstrate the 2016 Army S&T O&S metrics is anticipated to start in FY14.  The 2016 S&T O&S metrics are 65% Reduction in Inspections/ Flight Hour, 15% Reduction in Maintenance Labor/ Flight Hour, 20% Increase in Component Mean Time Between Removals, less than 3% False Removal Rates, and 25 Hour Detection Time Before Failure measured against a 2005 fielded aircraft baseline, plus a 10% Reduction in System and Installation Cost and 10% Reduction in System Weight measured against current systems. <BR><BR>REQUIREMENTS.  Technical Description.  The Government is seeking OSST-II solutions that reduce the future maintenance burden, reduce O&S costs, and enable implementation of CBM methodologies. Specifically, the Government desires to advance the state-of-the-art by investing in the development of technologies to allow. reduction of inspections and preventative maintenance; expansion of serviceability criteria; extension of life or time between overhaul; and prediction of failure with sufficient fidelity to allow scheduling of maintenance. Six rotorcraft technology areas, listed below, are identified as investment areas for OSST-II Applied Research. Technology area investments are expected to contribute to the 2016 S&T O&S metrics, but are not required to achieve the metrics in total. Offerors shall describe in their proposal a clear path for transition and quantifiable operations and support benefits, relative to the 2016 metrics. <BR>Propulsion System .  Turboshaft engine maintenance is a significant cost driver in rotorcraft operations and has a large impact on aircraft safety, reliability, and readiness.  Efforts in this technical area should further develop prognostic capabilities for propulsion components using novel algorithms and sensor designs while minimizing sensor and wiring weight.  Efforts shall further develop the ability to determine the RUL (remaining useful life) of engine mechanical components, controls, sensors, lubrication, and wiring, and provide feedback for mission planning and maintenance scheduling.  Lube System and mechanical components tend to be a high cost on over-all maintenance drivers.  A means to better track and predict lube system health would be of benefit.  Consideration should also be given to prognostics/RUL for electric accessories applicable to future engine designs. <BR>Drives System.  Efforts shall focus on prognosis of mechanical failures. Much effort has been put into detecting gear and bearing failures through vibration, as well as detecting gearbox housing corrosion. Proposed tasks shall extend the current work to develop prognostic methods with improved accuracy.  Models capable of simulating drive system faults are needed in order to reduce time required for testing.  Efforts shall be designed so that they can be integrated into a current Army health monitoring system.  Reduction of additional hardware weight (such as separate data collection boxes, and wiring) is needed.<BR>Electrical System.  Efforts shall focus on the prognosis of electrical components and wiring.  Electric components are currently replaced when functionality is lost.  Failure is treated as an event with no consideration for levels of degradation or functional margins.  Prognosis of electrical components is needed with health indications for the internal component state, the quality of output and impact on the overall system.  The burden of maintaining aircraft wiring is increasing due to the cumulative effects of fleet aging, normal repair activity and system modifications.  Technologies for health management of wiring are needed to reduce this burden.  System level models are needed that account for both wiring and electrical component health and tolerance to degradation.  <BR>Structures.  Structural maintenance labor and cost will be reduced through more durable and damage tolerant structures and managing the helicopters structural integrity.  To enable implementation of damage tolerance methodology and CBM, Applied Research is needed to develop and mature technologies that determine structural health and predict service life remaining (with some confidence interval) of airframe primary structural components (e.g. beams, frames, stringers).  Validation of the developed technologies on a representative airframe structural component is expected.  To maximize technology transition potential as well as minimize cost and aircraft weight penalty, solutions should address. (1) Wide-area monitoring of loads, damage, and environment through virtual or hybrid approaches that require little to no dedicated structural health monitoring (SHM) sensors. (2) Multipurpose and/or multifunctional data sources (potentially sensor nodes) capable of detecting a variety of damages and conditions through data interpretation. (3) Advanced algorithms capable of fusing available on-board data sources (e.g. HUMS, other aircraft diagnostic systems, bused aircraft state data) with a minimal number of dedicated SHM sensors to accurately derive the local / global health and determine the structural integrity status. (4) System level footprint and performance, to include size, weight, processing, durability, system reliability, and probability of detection.  The intent of this effort is to develop the capability to assess the structural integrity of an airframe without creating the burden of numerous single purpose sensors and their associated equipment.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to take advantage of currently available technologies (sensors, algorithms) and existing aircraft data sources wherever possible. <BR>Rotors System.  Rotor blade de-icing systems on Army rotorcraft consist of embedded resistive heater blankets, power distribution units, slip rings, controllers, temperature sensors, and other components.  De-icing systems are problematic and maintenance intensive. In some cases, the de-icing system is completely disabled in order to avoid the maintenance burden, resulting in a limited operational environment for the aircraft.  False indications of de-icing system failure are also a problem.  The Army desires reliable, accurate, on-board fault detection throughout the entire de-icing system that indicates the health of the de-icing system and its components, and eliminates false indications.  Research and development of active components (e.g. trailing edge flaps, leading edge slats, and active trim tab) to significantly improve next-generation rotor system performance is ongoing.  These systems utilize different types of actuators, such as electromechanical or piezoelectric, require power and data transfer, generate heat that can potentially harm adjacent components, and are exposed to a hostile operating environment (sand, rain, high centrifugal force).  These systems may be used for primary flight control, making the actuators and other components flight critical.  Therefore, the Army desires technology that can monitor the health of various types of active rotor components in order to ensure constant safe flight operations and timely maintenance actions to sustain safe flight. <BR>Vehicle Management System.  Vehicle Management System (VMS) components are transitioning to a more digital control realm that will introduce unique maintenance requirements.   The intent of this effort is to minimize unique maintenance requirements for digital VMS components (e.g. computers, inceptors, control units, actuators, and software) and the number, frequency, and amount of time required to perform maintenance actions for the VMS legacy components.  Expected unique digital component characteristics that will require maintenance actions within a digital VMS architecture should be addressed in the proposal.  This effort should. (1) develop technology to diagnose and prognose the health of VMS components in order to minimize maintenance actions on the proposed components; and (2) develop methodology(s) to validate and verify these developed technologies.  If this technology development addresses individual digital VMS components, the interaction of these components at the VMS level also needs to be addressed.   <BR>Deliverable Items.  All awards will require delivery of the following data items or deliverables. (1) Program Plan, (2) Bi-Monthly Progress, Cost and Performance Reports, (3) Final Report, (4) Final Briefing at Ft. Eustis, (5) Design Review Briefing Charts, (6) Test Plans, (7) Test Reports, and may require (8) Software Development Plan, and (9) Software Requirements Specification. (Note.  Each of these items shall be delivered in the Offerors format).   <BR>Proposal Evaluation.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR), hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to the University of Buffalo, Department of Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering to procure a contract with Victor Paquet to develop methodologies for video based exposure assessment.
<p>Purpose and objective:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) would like to contract with the university to collaborate in improving the safety and health of preparation and minerals processing plant workers when performing maintenance and repair work. The objective for the overall research project is to develop ergonomics audits for safety professionals in the mining industry such that they are able to perform comprehensive audits of workplace ergonomics that are not overly time-consuming or technical. The goal of this portion of the project is to determine key risks for injuries to maintenance and repair workers and develop recommendations to be included in the audit for reducing these risks. To quantify musculoskeletal disorder risk in preparation and minerals processing plants, this study will quantify mechanical exposures to workers (e.g. forces applied to the body, posture) while performing maintenance and repair work. These exposures will then be used to determine areas where future research should be conducted and those that will be included in the audit.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p>Using video of maintenance and repair tasks provided by NIOSH, establish appropriate methodologies (ex: PATH or MVTA) to characterize tasks using a video analysis package that is inexpensive to purchase (&lt; $3,000) or custom built. Compare methodologies by evaluating methods for validity and reliability. Develop taxonomy whereby tasks will be analyzed including process flow diagrams and job task analysis. Test and assess methods until satisfactory methods have been obtained and approved by NIOSH personnel. Using the accepted method, perform an analysis of approximately 100 hours of video provided by NIOSH and provide a descriptive analysis of exposures as they relate to the various tasks evaluated. Prepare report of exposures and provide raw data.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Reference 2010-Q-12150. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with University of Buffalo, Department of Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering, State University of New York, Buffalo, NY 14260-2050 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted. The government intends to exercise option years for this requirement; total period of performance would be three years.</p>

Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine Baltimore, MarylandSCOPE OF WORK CONTROL CANADA GEESE POPULATION AT FORT MCHENRY WITH USE OF WORKING BORDER COLLIES 
SCOPEIn accordance with the terms and conditions of the Contract, the Contractor shall perform the work of this task order for the National Park Service (NPS) as described below.CONFIDENTIALITYThe information developed under this task order is the property of the U.S. government and shall be kept in strict confidence.PERFORMANCE PERIODThe work shall begin following issuance of the delivery/task order, proceed in accordance with the schedule for submittals, and be completed one year from the date of issuance.POINTS OF CONTACT:Contractual:		Contracting Officer (CO):  TBD		Contracting Officer's Representative (COR):  Paul BitzelI.	General  InformationBackgroundA.	Located on the Patapsco River at the mouth of Baltimore's Inner Harbor, Fort McHenry is approximately three miles southeast of the center of the city, attracting 700,000 visitors annually.  This is the site which inspired Francis Scott Key to compose the poem which became our National Anthem as the "Star- Spangled Banner".  Key's verses describe the bombardment of Fort McHenry by the British on September 13-14, 1814 during what became known in this country as the War of 1812.B.	Used as early as 1776 for harbor defense, then known as Whetstone Point, the current 43.26 acre site was authorized as a National Park Unit in 1925 under the management of the War Department, until it was transferred to the administration of the National Park Service in 1933.  However, the military history of the property extends through World War II with its use during that time by the United States Coast Guard.  C.	Between 1798 and 1800, federal funds were made available for fortifications at Whetstone Point and much of this was directed to what the National Park Service refers to as Fort McHenry's "Star Fort".  D.	Project Description  The purpose of this project is to protect human health and resources from damage caused by resident and migratory Canada geese.  Environmentally safe and humane control of the Canada geese population that roost, feed and nest within the park boundary shall be accomplished  through the use of working border collies and other approved techniques to reduce the population of geese in the park to an acceptable level.  E.	Legal Authorities, Policies and Considerations1.	Canada geese area migratory game birds protected by federal and state legal authorities; specifically the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) signed in 1918 and amended in 1936, 1974 and 1989 (16 U.S.C. 703-711).  Geese populations are managed y the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, the Maryland Division of Fish and Wildlife Service pursuant to the MBTA, Federal Regulations (50 CFR 10, 13, 20 & 21), and state game codes.  President Clinton (2001) issued Executive Order 13186 directing federal agencies to protect migratory birds.  Therefore, the National park Service is subject to the provisions of the MBTA.  Procedure like handling nests and eggs, capturing and relocating or euthanizing birds, and shooting birds to reduce damage, and any other activity that includes handling birds, their parts, and/or their nests and eggs requires a depredation permit (USDA APHIS 2003a).  The permit application is available online or from the USDA APHIS Wildlife Services or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.2.	NO FEDERAL OR STATE PERMIT IS REQUIRED TO HARASS GEESE, AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT HANDLED.  3.	Population management through the use of oil and/or egg addling requires a Federal permit.4.	If dog inadvertently harms or kills a goose, the handler may be in violation of federal or state laws.




II.	SCOPE OF WORK		PART 1:  SCOPE		A.

Subsequently, Fort McHenry shall be visited two times/day or more as required, during each remaining day of the contracted period of performance.	E.	Egg Addling/Oiling shall be included in contracted service.  NPS will apply for the addling permit, which authorizes the control of local population of Canada geese by freezing, shaking, puncturing or oiling of the eggs and immediately replacing the eggs to the nest.  The contractor shall supply information and complete the report due at the expiration of the permit.  The contractor shall be named as the sub-permittee and will be the sole entity to handle the eggs and nests.      	F.	NPS shall notify the contractor at least twenty-four hours prior to the application of any chemicals including but not limited to fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. Insecticides and fungicides at the park.  	G.	The Contractor shall be fully insured to conduct this service.

<DESC>Synopsis
In less than 100 years there have been four influenza pandemics: The Spanish Flu of 1918, the Asian Flu of 1957, the Hong Kong Flu of 1968, and most recently the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. Production of a vaccine to immunize against the influenza strain causing the next pandemic must occur as quickly as possible at any time of year. The ability to achieve this objective currently is limited by the seasonal nature of influenza vaccine production and seasonal variability in the availability of supplies essential to vaccine manufacture. Assuring the early availability of a sufficient quantity of vaccine for the U.S. population in the setting of a pandemic will potentially prevent thousands of deaths and save billions of dollars.
The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has an obligation to promote capabilities that assure a pandemic vaccine can be produced at a U.S.-licensed influenza vaccine facility at any time of the year, without limitations imposed by the availability of essential supplies. In addition DHHS is interested in development of investigational influenza vaccine lots against potential pandemic strains. An ongoing program is designed to support these interests.
The purpose of this requirement is twofold: (1) to assure the year-round availability of sufficient embryonated hens eggs and other essential supplies to support production of pandemic influenza vaccine at full current capacity; and (2) to produce investigational lots of pandemic-like influenza vaccine for clinical testing.
It is anticipated that the resulting contract duration will be for a 36-month base with three 24-month option periods. This requirement will be Full and Open to all sources; it is anticipated that a Request for Proposals will be issued for this requirement on or about 15 days after the release of this synopsis. The solicitation, all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through the FedBizOpps posting system at http://www.fedbizopps.gov under the Vendors option followed by selection of the DHHS. As such, no written, telephonic, facsimile or email requests for the solicitation package will be honored. Interested parties can register at the aforementioned site to receive procurement announcements by email. Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it is solely the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps website for any solicitation amendments. The NAICS code for this solicitation is 325412. NO OTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit an offer.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Contractors must submit questions concerning, or request clarification of, any aspect of the draft specification electronically via e-mail to john.dijoseph@usmc.mil no later than 20 January 2009.   Comments and questions must reference Request for Quotation M00146-10-T-9023.  
8.  Failure of a contractor to submit questions regarding this requirement or to attend the Site Visit will be construed to mean that the contractor fully understands all requirements of the final specification and Request for Quotation.  In no event will failure of a contractor to submit questions or inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.
9.  Interested contractors should continue to monitor the NECO web sites for additional information and documents relating to this requirement.

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command, Joint Munitions and Lethality Contracting Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of the U.S Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), is seeking sources that will improve the capabilities of the war figther. Below are some of the technologies that are of interest.This notice is not limited to the below technologies and ideas, and any new idea or technologies that will improve Target Acquisition and Fire Control are welcome:1.	Non-lethal directed energy weapon utilizing intense visible light tocause temporary blindness and can be attached quickly on a M16 or M4Carbine. 2.	Embedded Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) products for smalland medium caliber ammunition types to allow better tracking of theammunition.3.	A special fabric (uniform material) that will reduce the soldier'sinfrared radiation / signature or appear to be at the same infraredradiation level as the surroundings  (Avoid detection by infrared sensors).4.	Low cost sensors that would detect missiles and other hostile fireevents. 5.	A low cost short range handheld device for detection of concealedsmall arms weapons, Improvised Explosive Devices, mines and other hiddenthreats using undetectable ultra wideband radar or another technology. Thedevice may also be used as building / wall penetrating radar to detectconcealed armed enemy combatants. It should be:a.	Robust with reference to interference or jamming - thus undetectableand hard to intercept b.	Designed not to interfere with other radar systems. c.	Light weight for very short-range applications d.	Can be tuned to be target specific (with the ability to specifymultiple targets)6.	There is need within the Army for a Modeling and Simulationapplication that can predict target acquisition performance of Direct ViewOptics (DVO) (similar to 'NVTHERM' for FLIR systems).  It is desirable tohave a tool that will calculate performance using measured inputs fromcurrent production systems and the calculate the performance ofconceptual/developmental systems modeled in programs such as ZEMAX.  The DVOinformation, together with environmental inputs such as atmospherictransmission (due to obscurants like rain, fog, smoke), will be used togenerate a graph/relationship between  image characteristics,  range andatmospheric conditions.  The image characteristics, combined with theunderstanding of the human psychophysical response, will result in aprediction of target acquisition performance of the DVO.  (the applicationcan be validated by comparing the models output versus DVO systems inproduction performance).7.	There is a need in the Army for a combined Direct View Optic (DVO)and SWIR imager.  Since each of these wave bands offers distinct advantagesto the Warfighter it is desirable to provide a system capable of viewingboth bands.  This handheld optic can be dual or single channel and shouldprovide the option of a fused Visible/SWIR imagery (VNIR/SWIR would also beacceptable for this proposal).  Methods of Active and Passive IdentificationFriend-or-Foe (IFF) are desirable. 8.	The Army is interested in the capability to design and fabricaterobust nano-structured high performance anti-reflection coatings that allowover 98.5% light /energy transmission over a broad visible spectral rangewith cone angles up to 120 degrees.  The intended use is for improvedBattlespace Awareness.9.	The Army is interested in a small, low cost navigation sensor. Thesensor may include but not limited to inclinometer, accelerometer, orgyroscope. The sensor has to be stable and highly accurate. It is desirablethat the sensor can withstand high shock levels and ruggedized for militaryenvironments.
Firms/companies are invited to indicate their capabilities by providing specifications, brochures, manuals, reports, demonstration video and other technical data. The submittals provided will not be returned. All responses shall be sent at no cost to the US Government NO LATER THAN CLOSE OF BUSINESS JUNE 01, 2010 to the US Army ARDEC. ATTN: Pamela Penaherrera Bldg 10 Picatinny, NJ 07866-5000, email: pam.penaherrera@us.army.mil. In addition, please provide the firms name and address, point of contact with telephone number and email address, and size of business (small/large).  TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  The Government will accept written questions by email. This is a market survey to be used for informational planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is the Government obligated to issue an RFP. The US Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. The government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.

<SUBJECT>Services to Continue the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR).

<RESPDATE>051410
<CONTACT>Daniel Matusiewicz, Contract Specialist, Phone 301.443.4703, Fax 301.443.6038, Email dmatusiewicz@hrsa.gov - Francis R Murphy, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 443-5165, Fax (301)443-5462, Email fmurphy@hrsa.gov
<DESC>Description<br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUB Zone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide services to Continue the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR). The Division of Transplantation, Healthcare Systems Bureau, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is seeking a contractor to operate the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR). The Contractor will be responsible for providing statistical and other analytic support to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) in the formulation and evaluation of organ allocation and other OPTN policies. Additionally, the Contractor will provide analytic support to the Department of Health and Human Services in a variety of areas including: policy formulation and evaluation, system performance metrics, economic analysis, and preparation of recurring and special reports to Congress, including the Biennial Report to Congress of the Clinical and Scientific Status of Organ Donation and Transplantation in the U.S. The Contractor will be responsible for working closely with the OPTN and the Contractor for the OPTN on data collection, analysis and quality improvement activities. The OPTN Contractor is responsible for primary data collection and providing these data to the SRTR on a regular basis. The OPTN collects data for each major event in the transplant process including: patient registration on the transplant waitlist, transplant procedure or removal from the transplant waitlist, and periodic follow-up of both transplant recipient and living donor following transplantation. The OPTN also collects information about the organ donor and the disposition of organs retrieved from each donor. The SRTR is responsible for the effective organization, maintenance, storage and protection of this data and supplementing these data, as necessary, with data from other available data sets, to establish and utilize an ongoing analytic data set for the purpose of conducting analyses in support of the OPTN and HRSA and for making a subset of these data available for bona fide research.
<p><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Section 373 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act requires the operation of SRTR tosupport an ongoing evaluation of the scientific and clinical status of solid organ transplantation including: kidney, heart, liver, lung, pancreas, and intestine transplants. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may include other organs within the definition of organ for purposes of the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) and the OPTN final rule (42 CFR 121). The OPTN Contractor is responsible for primary data collection and providing these data to the SRTR on a monthly basis. From 1987 to 2000, HRSA contracted with the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) to develop and operate the SRTR. Since September 28, 2000, the University Renal Research and Education Association (URREA) has operated the SRTR. In July of 2006, URREA formally changed its name to Arbor Research Collaborative for Health. Currently, the database contains information on approximately 850,000 waitlist registrants, 475,000 transplant recipients, and 235,000 deceased and living donors. The size of most current monthly OPTN database transfer is over 60 gigabytes, including over 650 million records, and 13,870 columns in over 1,000 tables. The size of this database will continue to expand given the tremendous demand for organ transplants. Approximately 28,000 organ transplants performed in the U.S. in 2009. As of the end of March 2010, there were approximately 106,000 individuals with end-stage organ failure awaiting organ transplants in the U.S. The demand for organs for transplants far surpasses and will continue to surpass the number of organs donated each year. There is a clear need for the monitoring and evaluation of advances in transplant surgery techniques, clinical donor management and organ preservation, improvements in matching donor organs with recipients, and developments in immunosuppressive therapies in order to improve transplant outcomes.</p>
<p>The OPTN final rule provides a framework for the structure and responsibilities of the OPTN. One of the major responsibilities of the OPTN is the development of policies that determine how deceased donor organs are allocated to transplant candidates. The OPTN final rule requires that these policies be based on sound medical judgment and reviewed periodically and revised as appropriate. It is the primary responsibility of the SRTR Contractor to provide the analytic support and evidence necessary to support the OPTN in the development and evaluation of OPTN policy. Although, the SRTR Contractor is substantively involved in the policy development process, it is the responsibility of the OPTN and not the SRTR Contractor to develop OPTN policy.</p>
<p><br />REQUIRED TASKS<br />The Contractor for the SRTR shall serve as the primary analytic resource to the OPTN and HHS. The SRTR contractor shall provide analytic expertise to support analysis of a broad range of issues relating to: waitlist and post-transplant outcomes evaluation; the evaluation of existing OPTN policies; the likely impact of proposed OPTN policies; and the operation and performance of the OPTN as a whole and of its various members. The performance of this contract requires the Contractor to establish and maintain a close working relationship with: the OPTN Contractor; the various committees and members of the OPTN; the Division of Transplantation (DOT and other entities within HHS such as Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Agency For Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS); the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Organ Transplantation (ACOT); and other members of the transplant community. In the performance of this contract, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities needed to perform the tasks <br />described in this Statement of Work (SOW). Most of the data required to perform these tasks shall be those collected by the OPTN Contractor and provided to the SRTR Contractor on a periodic basis, but will also include other datasets to be provided by the SRTR Contractor to help validate and supplement the OPTN data.</p>
<p>A Cost type contract is anticipated, for one base year and one option year. The previous source for this requirement was the University Renal Research and Education Association, Arbor Research Collaborative, Ann Arbor, Michigan. The NAICS Code is 541690 with a small business size standard of $7.0m.<br />Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice. However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required. Responses must directly demonstrate the company's capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform each of the tasks described above at a sufficient level of detail to allow definitive numerical evaluation; and evidence that the contractor can satisfy the minimum requirements listed above while in compliance with FAR 52.219-14 ("Limitations on Subcontracting"). Failure to definitively address each of these factors will result in a finding that respondent lacks capability to perform the work.<br />Responses to this notice shall be limited to 15 pages, and must include:<br />1. Company name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and FAX numbers, website address (if available), and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.<br />2. Name, title, telephone number, and e-mail addresses of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses.<br />3.

Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure.<br />This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in this announcement. This request is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this announcement.<br />Responses to this notice must be received by the Contract Specialist named below not later than 2:00 PM Eastern Standard time on May 14, 2010 for consideration.

<SUBJECT>Develop Recruitment Strategy and Recruit Participants for a CAT Tool Study associated with SSA's Disability Evaluation Process
<SOLNBR>SSN20100503
<RESPDATE>051810
<CONTACT>Ann G Argaman, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 594-5919, Fax (301) 594-5920, Email ann.argaman@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center is conducting a market survey/sources sought to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZONE small business capable of serving the needs mentioned below. This market survey/sources sought announcement is not a request for proposals and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research. The Government will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this market survey.
<p>The Rehabilitation Medicine Department in the Clinical Research Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH-RMD) in Bethesda, Maryland has agreed to assist the Social Security Administration (SSA) explore innovative methods for augmenting the disability evaluation process. This requires assessment of individuals' abilities across a variety of functional domains while considering functional workplace demands and environmental features of workplace, home, and community settings. Current efforts to develop assessments of human functioning using computer adaptive testing (CAT) tools founded upon item response theory (IRT) are underway. The use of CAT tools could potentially allow the SSA to collect more relevant and precise data, in a faster, more efficient fashion. Rapid assessment methods are needed that are compatible with SSA processes and will yield easily interpretable results that can be efficiently and meaningfully integrated to provide accurate and uniform information about an individual's ability to engage in substantial gainful employment.</p>
<p>To meet objectives associated with the NIH-RMD collaboration with the SSA, CAT tool development will require a calibration study for each instrument. A calibration study is a field study of item content and structure conducted with samples of respondents representing the intended users of the CAT instruments. Item pool development and subsequent item calibration are unique for each CAT tool and for the target population for which they are developed. To better support the SSA's evaluation process, distinct applicant and provider CAT instruments are being developed. Participant recruitment and telephone as well as internet test administration will be needed to conduct the CAT tool calibration studies.</p>
<p>The NIH-RMD seeks a contractor for a base period of six months, with one 6 month unilateral option available to extend the term of services, who will develop a detailed recruitment plan and implement a participant recruitment effort to achieve projected sample sizes for the calibration studies. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541512, Size Standard - $21.0 million dollars</p>
<p>The recruitment plan must seamlessly integrate with existing work being conducted by Boston University to develop CAT tools under Contract number HHSN26920090004C. For the purposes of CAT calibration, it will be necessary to collect information from both providers and claimants about the functional abilities of claimants relative to workplace demands. It is recommended that pairs (or dyads) of claimants and providers be recruited for the CAT calibration studies. Sample sizes for most scientifically defensible CAT calibration projects are in the range of 500-700 respondents. This sample size is needed to support a series of confirmatory factor analyses and to perform statistical modeling. Inadequate sample size may lead to inaccurate and unstable statistical outcomes. Due to projected response rates for the recruitment of claimants and providers, the anticipated recruitment volume will require the contractor to provide evidence of established procedures and staffing to efficiently manage the recruitment effort. The contractor must demonstrate expertise in CAT tool development and the application of CAT technology for the purposes of disability assessment. The contractor should demonstrate prior success in the completion of calibration studies associated with CAT tool development in domains of human functioning. In order to optimize the contractor's ability to complete this requirement in the established timeframe, current SSA clearances are required.</p>
<p>The vendor responses must demonstrate their expertise in ALL of the areas described above. Please note that failure to specifically demonstrate capability to provide the required services in your response to this market survey may affect the Government's review of industry's ability to perform these services. The vendor's response shall be in sufficient detail to allow the Government to assess the capability of your firm.</p>
<p>The vendor response shall also include any other specific and relevant information related to the requirements of this project that will enable the Government to determine the capabilities of the company to perform the specialized requirements described in this synopsis. Interested organizations must demonstrate and document in any response submitted, to this market survey extensive experience with and the ability to perform all of the specialized requirements elsewhere described.</p>
<p>This notice is a market survey and is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The Government will not award a Purchase Order or Contract based upon Vendor responses to this announcement. The Government shall not assume any costs for preparing or submitting any information in response to the market survey or the Government's use of the information. Any proprietary information should be clearly identified as "proprietary information".</p>
<p>Vendors must send written capability responses by May 18, 2010 to the Contract Specialist at the following e-mail address aargaman@cc.nih.gov. For any questions, please contact Ms. Ann Argaman at (301) 594-5919.</p>

<DESC>RFI- Medical Maintenance Reprocurement<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM), Center for Health Care Contracting (CHCC), on behalf of the Department of the Army, and the Department of the Air Force has developed this Request for Information (RFI) to solicit market research information from industry to assist the Government with analysis of a Government requirement and provide commercial insight on performance-based solutions, best practices, possible contractual arrangements, and potential issues.<BR><BR>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a Solicitation, or an indication the CHCC will contract for the items contained in the RFI. This RFI is part of a Government market research effort to determine the scope of industry capabilities and interest and will be treated as information only.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responses to this RFI are strictly voluntary and the Government will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI. Responses to this RFI will not be returned and respondents will not be notified of the result of the review.  If a Solicitation is issued, it will be announced on the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fbo.gov at a later date, and all interested parties must respond to that Solicitation announcement separately from any response to this announcement.  This RFI does not restrict the Governments acquisition approach on a future Solicitation.<BR><BR>The Governments requirement is to obtain non-personal services in which the contractor shall provide service, repair, calibration, upgrading and performance  of preventive maintenance on a per call basis for the representative types of equipment specified in the Technical Exhibits attached in the following pages.  A draft performance work statement (PWS) is attached to this announcement.<BR><BR>The Government desires that respondents offer their experience and recommendations on the following questions and issues related to the medical maintenance requirements of the Army and Air Force.  When addressing these items, respondents should consider the size and scope of the requirement, which includes providing services to the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs), listed in Technical Exhibit A along with the inherent possibility of future CONUS Air Force base locations being possibly added over the period of performance.<BR><BR>1.

<p>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and Joint Services Community are seeking commercial technology solutions to requirements associated with clandestine underwater communications and navigation.</p>
<p>The desired capabilities for an underwater communications device are as follows:<br />&bull; Lightweight, waterproof, survive and operate in battlefield environments<br />&bull; Provide digital acoustic signal through water communications <br />&bull; Have a low noise output that can blend with ambient noise levels from beach to harbor environments<br />&bull; Have an underwater range of up to 500 yards depending on the environment<br />&bull; Provide an on demand homing signal<br />&bull; Be able to allow communication between up to six swim pairs of divers and a host platform<br />&bull; 3D underwater compass for depth and direction<br />&bull; Have a minimum 12 hours active use between charges<br />&bull; Be small enough to be wrist worn, compact, and not interfere with combat swimmer activities<br />&bull; Allow for software upgrades as they are developed<br />&bull; Achieved a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 7 or higher</p>
<p>The technology will be used by swim teams operating at night. The focus will be on technologies that provide clear communications, accurate navigation and homing, and allow swimmers the maximum team situational awareness at the desired ranges. Sources having the capability to provide technologies addressing any or all of these requirements are invited to submit white papers (6-10 pages maximum); white papers need to include sufficient technical information for a review panel to assess the scientific validity of the submitted technology (e.g., system technology, sub-component technologies, system dimensions, information display, weight, power, environmental tolerances to temp, water, vibration, EMI).

<DESC>DO NOT SUBMIT A QUOTE AT THIS TIME<br />Please read the ENTIRE synopsis before submitting any response.
<p>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado has a Brand Name Only requirement for the purchase of Dell Latitude E6400 Notebooks. This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-41, 13 April 2010. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 334111 and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>The USAF Academy has a Brand Name Only requirement to purchase Dell Notebooks. Dell Notebooks have been approved by the 10th Communications Squadron as the standard across the USAFA .mil network. Per AFNetOps Functional Concepts, para 6.5, "Standardization of configurations, processes, and applications across the enterprise, from the gateway to the desktop, will facilitate centralized management, enhance security through configuration control, and save manpower in certification and accreditation, patch implementation, hardware/software upgrades, and asset tracking." Also per para 6.1 "Robust, redundant data paths and nodes with both physical and logical diversity are needed to maximize effectiveness and eliminate single points of failure. This will enable the integration of distributed capabilities, improve real-time detection/correlation of network anomalies, and give the AFNetOps Commander a comprehensive picture of any potential network degradation, outage, or attack. As importantly, it will help the NetOps community better understand the impact of network actions and the war-fighting operations that rely on their support."</p>
<p>This guidance lends itself to procuring, configuring and maintaining one standard platform per network that can be cannibalized if necessary, switched out with no impacts and easily repaired physically or remotely when needed. Also, a single platform is easier to track when products are under warranty.</p>
<p>The Academy server farm is standardized on Microsoft Operating Systems, ensuring continuity of training for our Network Administration staff. Limited platforms enable fast and accurate troubleshooting and reduce training overhead.</p>
<p>Although other brands, such as HP or IBM would meet our need from a technological standpoint, they incur much greater complexity for management and administration, due to the increasing number of discrete hardware platforms and the fact that USAFA has multiple independent networks. In addition, purchasing other brands would not meet the guidance of the AFNetOps Functional Concepts described above.</p>
<p>By standardizing on Dell, USAFA is able to manage and administer multiple networks, multiple platforms and the associated training and troubleshooting tasks that are unique to each. Standardizing on Dell to support the machines with Microsoft operating systems enables our desktop technicians to do more with less in an ever-changing technological environment.</p>
<p>Delivery is to be made to IT Accountability 5136 Community Center Drive East Loading Dock at the U.S. Air Force Academy.<br />FOB: Destination.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. DO NOT SUBMIT A QUOTE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>Any offerors believing they have an equal product that meets all of the features and functionality of the Dell Latitude E6400 Notebooks may provide EVIDENCE for consideration. Evidence must support the offeror's claim they can provide an equal product. It is the offerors responsibility to prove their product is an equal by demonstrating their product, at a minimum, has the same features and functionality of the brand name product. Providing brochures, specifications and/or quotes alone is not enough for the Government to make a decision. The offeror should provide an understandable comparison between the two products. The Government is not responsible for developing the comparison from insufficient information provided. All qualified sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by this agency. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a brand name or equal procurement can be conducted. A determination that equal products exist based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received 12:00 pm NOON Mountain Standard Time (MST) on 7 May 2010. Responses received after this will be considered late IAW FAR 52.212-1(f) and will not be evaluated. <br /><br />The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis. Contractors must have a current registration with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov and with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>
<p>Questions should be addressed to the Primary POC Karen Jackson, Contract Specialist, (719) 333-4060 or sent via e-mail to karen.jackson@usafa.af.mil. Alternate POC is Leslie Ryan, Contracting Officer, (719) 333-3961, leslie.ryan@usafa.af.mil.</p>
<p>5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen,</p>
<p>Kelly Snyder<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-9018<br />email: kelly.snyder@usafa.af.mil</p>
<p>Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with Raytheon Company (Raytheon) of Garland, Texas to provide an additional "bridge" of six months, 01 October 2010 through 31 March 2011, of service of the existing high performance computing (HPC) system being leased by the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) under contract DG133H-07-CN-0002.  The HPC system is the sum of three subsystems located at three locations: in IBM's Business Continuity and Recovery Services facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) in Princeton, NJ, and the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) in Boulder, CO.  This synopsis serves to notify the public of the proposed contract action.<br /><br />The Government intends to modify the existing contract to acquire an additional six months of processing capability, storage, networking, software, services and facility housing/services in support of research and development activities associated with the R&amp;D HPCS program.  The existing HPC system was designed by Raytheon to provide a balanced supercomputing environment that includes not only large-scale computing but disk storage and tape storage with associated infrastructure to access existing data archives.&nbsp; At Boulder, NOAA has three computing clusters.  The first system, W-jet, has 1,456 Intel Woodcrest cores, the second system, H-jet, has 2,016 Intel Harpertown cores, and the third system, N-jet has 3,584 Intel Nehalem cores. Boulder has 142 TB of disk storage and 1 AML/J tape library.  NOAA has two clusters located at the IBM facility in Gaithersburg which are comprised of 2,736 cores.  The first cluster consists of IBM P5 cores and the second cluster consists of IBM P6 cores.  There are 329 TB of raid storage and 3 STK Powderhorn tape libraries (11.3 PB). At Princeton, NOAA has 7,790 SGI cores comprised of both Montecito and Montvale architectures.  Princeton has 2 SGI nodes that are dedicated to post processing activities and 9 SGI nodes dedicated to batch processing.  Princeton has 437 TB of raid disk storage, 5 STK Powderhorn tape libraries (13.5 PB), and one SL8500 tape library.<br /><br />The HPC systems currently utilized by NOAA directly supports NOAA's strategic goals in climate, weather and water by enabling its research into the physical processes governing the Earth's weather, climate and ocean.
<p>The HPC systems must provide a continuation of operational performance at least equivalent to the existing system, and meet the current dependability standard of 97% system availability and 99% scientific data availability guarantee for the Gaithersburg and Boulder subsystems, and 95% system availability and 95% scientific data availability at the Princeton subsystem.  The HPC system must be fully supported by system administrators and maintenance provided on a 7X24 basis.  The HPC system must continue to support full integration with the existing tape archival subsystems.  In addition, the HPC system must be integrated into each subsystem's local area network and wide area network, supported by industry standard communications hardware/software.</p>
<p>The estimated budget for the additional six months of system and facility utilization is approximately $6.6 million.  NOAA anticipates leasing the hardware and software and purchasing services under fixed-price terms.  Six months of maintenance (7X24) and support services must be included in the acquisition.  Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government's requirements are invited to submit an affirmative response.  To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates and ability to furnish a production-ready system capable of meeting the previously cited requirements and a facility to support that system.  Seamless integration of the HPC system into the existing infrastructure is required.  Of particular concern to the Government is accomplishment of system integration with zero disruption of current R&amp;D activities.  Vendors must include in their response an explanation, in detail, of its plan to implement and manage integration with the existing HPC and communications systems.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion. Affirmative responses must be received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.</p>

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER DACW01-03-C-0017.  Using Recovery Act Funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number DACW01-03-C-0017, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Walter F George Lake, ACF Rivers Project, Fort Gaines Georgia, awarded to Anderson Construction Company, 58 Crozier Lane, Fort Gaines, Georgia. Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds were previously added to the basic contract. The contractor will develop specifications and perform building rehab services including connecting existing sewage system to FT Gaines, GA municipal system and installing a rainwater collection system for irrigation and erosion control at the ACF Rivers Project Management office. The modification will also incorporate contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds.  This existing contract must be used because: 1) The contractor is currently performing a major renovation to the building these systems serve.  2) This contract enables work to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on the visiting public, commercial shipping and the economy. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation , and, to the maximum extent practicable, making fixed-price (FP) contract awards using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although Mobile District's contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles for the work anticipated under this modification.<BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>US Army Engineer District, Mobile, P.

Contract Line Item number 1, is changed from Exact Flow Extended Range Turbine Flowmeter, Part Number EFM08ER-L-4-AN-A-2 to Part Number EFM08DR-L-4-AN-B-2/4 (CAL 2B2) EXACT FLOW DUAL ROTOR TURBINE FLOWMETER, is changed from 18 each to 13 each; and Contract Line Item number 2, is changed from Channel Signal Conditioner, 10 Ohm Power 10-32 VDC and PCM Decommunator comes with differential I/O Cable, Part Number EF21514-004 to Part Number EF3575-003 COMPUTER IFC15BBAP ESD PROTECTION W/FIRMWARE REV G, is changed from 5 each to 13 each.  Program for EFM08 flowmeters. Data Packet/calibration reports 13 each. 
Description for Exact Flow Dual Rotor Turbine Flowmeter-The ExactT Dual-rotor (DR) design extends the turbine flowmeters lower flow range far below traditional single rotor designs by overcoming the drag and torsional forces on the rotor.  The dual rotors become hydraulically coupled, due to their counter-rotational direction.  The angular flow path, onto the second rotor, overcomes the inertia due to its perpendicular force on the helical blades.  Three major physical benefits result from dual-rotor technology: 1. The ability to monitor the integrity of the bearing by looking at the frequency ratios of both rotors.  2.  The dual rotor significantly reduces flow swirl effects, eliminating the need for flow straighteners. 3.  Developing of multiple viscosity calibrations or UVC plots blend over a wider flow range, yielding 60:1 usable flow ranges.  
About the technology:  Turbine flow meters have traditionally had a repeatable flow range of approximately 100:1 and a maximum linear flow range of 30:1.  These turndown numbers have always been a result of the single-rotor turbine meter becoming affected by blade drag at lower flow rates.  This blade drag causes the turbine blade to stop spinning due to its inability to overcome the torsional forces at work.  Exact flows patented dual-rotor turbine design extends the lower flow range far below what has been possible before.  As fluid passes through the meter, the dual rotors become hydraulically coupled due to their counter-rotation.  This allows the rotors to overcome the inertia and drag that affects all single-rotor turbine flow meters.  Exact Flow dual-rotor turbine flowmeters have an incredible repeatable flow range of up to as much as 500:1 and a UVC turndown range of 60:1.  This allows the user to deploy fewer flow meters to cover a wide range of flow.  This lowers the initial purchase cost as well as simplifying system integration and future maintenance.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>Factor 5 - Enhanced 911 Service. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911. <br /><br />Factor 6 - Diversity. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound pictorial approach for diversity to include the methodology for accomplishing diversity.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>Sole Source Intent. The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) Center  Yuma at US ArmyYuma Proving Grounds (USAYPG), Arizona, intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price contract on a sole source basis with Laser Techniques Company, LLC; 6742 185th Ave. NE  Suite 300; Redmond, WA 98052-6714, pursuant to FAR 13.106(1)(b).  This acquisition of the Portable Laser Bore Mapping Inspection System for 105-120-155mm Cannon Gun Tube of Self-Propelled guns will support cannon tube inspection and measurement capabilities for mission requirements.  The Metrology and Simulation Division uses Laser Techniques Company (LTC) equipment for inspection and measurement purposes on 105- 155mm artillery and 25-81mm mortar cannon gun tubes.  This new requirement must be form, fit, function, and software compatible to interact with existing YPG laser based inspection systems.  LTC holds proprietary data rights to the hardware and software of YPGs existing systems, is the sole supplier of replacement parts, possesses certified and trained personnel to perform maintenance and owns the specialized tools to perform proper calibrations.  USAYPG currently has over $1,250,000.00 invested in LTC equipment within Metrology and Simulation Division.  If instrumentations were acquired from any other source, we would be forced to reconfigure this equipment, which would result in hundreds of thousands of dollars on investment not to mention loss of the existing equipment. This will be a commercial acquisition using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial items per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12 and FAR 13.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519 with a standard size 500 employees. This contract will consist of one Contract Line Item Number (CLIN), Quantity: 1, Unit of Issue: each, Description: Portable Laser Bore Mapping Inspection System for 105-120-155mm Cannon Gun Tube of Self Propelled Guns per attached specifications.  Award for this requirement will be in accordance with FAR part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If you feel that your firm possesses the ability to provide these requirements, then you must respond by demonstrating your firms technical capability to meet these requirements by 10 May 2010, 9:00 AM. MST.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  All inquiries shall be clearly marked with solicitation W9124R-10-T-1019 and sent to the contact information, the web notification or by facsimile to 928-328-6849.  In order to protect propriety information and prevent the unintentional releasing of guarded information, all interested firms must conduct their own research regarding the specifications of the above listed items.   <BR><BR><BR>Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) Center  Yuma, AZ<BR>301 C Street, Bldg 2100 Rm 12<BR>ATTN: W9124R-10-T-1019<BR>USAYPG, Yuma AZ 85365-9498<BR>Commercial:  (928) 328-6656<BR>DSN:  899-6656<BR>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:
<p>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-33.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334510 for full and open competition.</p>
<p>The FDA intends to issue a firm fixed-price purchase order for a Complete Cytogenetic System that meets or exceeds the following specifications:</p>
<p>The salient characteristics that apply to the Complete Cytogenetic Imaging System are:<br />1. System should be based on a unique electro-optical hardware that enables measuring the spectral image of chromosomes from a metaphase spread, previously stained, such that each chromosome has a different color (created typically from different combinations of 5 or more basic fluorescent dyes). While the staining scheme of multicolor-FISH (m-FISH) is identical, SKY's measurement scheme is very different than the one used in m-FISH, which is basically standard FISH acquisition done using multiple microscope filters.<br />2. All dyes are excited and acquired simultaneously using a single triple band filter cube using single focusing.<br />3. Achieves good Signal to Noise Ratio. Typical measurement time is 40-60 seconds; however, even 15 seconds acquisitions give better results than mFISH.<br />4. Measures the entire spectrum at each point enables the completely extraction of the emission spectrum of each dye. Errors due to cross talk, high background or wrong contrast of specific layers are minimized. The outcome is therefore a robust classification of chromosomes.<br />5. Accurate quantification of non specific staining background is subtracted accurately. The acquisition is invariant the intensity variation of dyes.<br />6. Ability to analyze overlaps and inter-mix chromosomal translocations seen consistently in cancer.<br />7. The level of automation of a system also influences the accuracy, repeatability and mainly the throughput. System is fully automatic, from the acquisition stage right through to the analysis and verification.<br />8. Interferometer (Optical Head) is manufactured only by ASI and programmed to function with ASI's imaging software. Spectral range of interferometer: 400-1000 microns (with special setup even in the UV<br />from 350-400nm). <br />9. User defined spectral resolution (from 6nm to 50nm or larger gap per channel). ASI's spectral imaging system can be setup to give as low as 3nm FWHM at 400nm (Full Width at Half Maximum of the peak of a narrow signal).<br />10. This system should also work for non-polarized light. ASI's interferometer<br />imaging system does not block transmitted light. Has a higher resolution per image pixel (16-bit spectral data per pixel).<br />11. Cooled Digital Camera - works with cooled to -20 degrees Celsius (as well as non-cooled) 12 bit digital camera with 1.3M pixels, ~70% peak quantum efficiency.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS DEADLINE: all questions must be received by email (george.gonzalez@fda.hhs.gov) before 1:00 pm (1300) EST on 12 May 2010.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY  UNDERSTORY MECHANICAL FUELS REDUCTION ( SUPERIOR NATIONAL FOREST)

RECOVERY - This project is funded in whole by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this project is to reduce fire risk in wildland-urban interface areas.  Fire suppression has allowed shade tolerant species such as balsam fir to establish and proliferate in the understory of upland forest types.  Decades of fire exclusion has resulted in a change in species composition, higher fuel loadings, an increase in ladder fuels, and a severe departure in the frequency and intensity of fires that would have occurred here historically.  The work to be performed will reduce the understory fuel hazards of designated stands.  Implementation of these treatments would substantially reduce the risk of wildfires threatening adjacent values at risk.

PROJECT LOCATION: The project is located in the Cook and Lake Counties of Minnesota. Various locations within the SUPERIOR NATIONAL FOREST (See INDEX MAPS)

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE AND SITE VISIT INFORMATION: 
Contract time will be 730 days (2 years) from Notice to Proceed.  
Post-Award Conference  SEE RFP for details


ESTIMATE COST RANGE: Between $250,000 and $500,000. 


SET-ASIDE: THIS PROCUREMENT IS HEREBY DETERMINED FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION UNRESTRICTED. The NAICS Code is 115310.

Contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and must have completed a profile in the Online Representations and Certifications Database (OCRA) prior to an award of a contract.

Eradicate Pests in Museum Collections through Anoxia Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site
Project DescriptionThe National Park Service is seeking anoxic treatment services for historic textiles from the collections of the Vanderbilt Mansion in Hyde Park, New York.   These collections are comprised of carpets and rugs, tapestries, draperies, bed hangings, and upholstered furniture totaling approximately 6000 cubic feet.  These selected collections have been housed in the house and subjected to a chronic infestation of museum pests including at least clothes moths and dermestids.  The collections are being moved to a purpose-built collection storage facility, and will be treated en route through these contracted services.  
The NPS will provide transportation of the collections to and from a suitable off-site facility, the provision of which is to be included in this contracted service, within approximately a one-hour drive, one way, of Hyde Park, New York.

Historic BackgroundThe Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site is one of three congressionally-designated sites managed jointly by the National Park Service (NPS) in Hyde Park, New York.  The site comprises portions of the former country estate of Frederick and Louise Vanderbilt, known historically as Hyde Park.  The Vanderbilt house was built on a ridge overlooking the Hudson River in 1895-98 by McKim, Mead and White, one of the most important architectural firms in the history of the United States. A number of important decorators contributed to the house interiors, including Georges Glaenzer, Jules Allard, and Ogden Codman, in additional to Stanford White.  The interiors are richly appointed, fashionable rooms and are archetypes of the American Renaissance period.  All textiles that are the focus of this contract are original to the house and therefore of high associative and historic value.  
The site was designated a National Historic Site in 1940 under the direction of President--and native Hyde Park resident-- Franklin D. Roosevelt, and is currently managed jointly by the NPS with FDR's home and that of Eleanor Roosevelt.
Scope of WorkUPON AWARD OF CONTRACT, perform the following services:  
Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, materials, facilities and travel needed to eradicate pests in selected historic collections of the Vanderbilt house by exposure to an anoxic environment.  The selected Contractor shall:
"	Provide a suitable space for performing the treatment in a facility no more than one-hour's drive, one way, from Hyde Park, New York;"	Establish the requisite treatment time for a 100% kill of pests in all life stages based on existing environmental conditions;"	Create and maintain an airtight container within the facility capable of maintaining an oxygen-free (under 0.3% oxygen with a target concentration of 0.1%) environment, using argon or nitrogen gas to achieve and maintain that environment;"	Control the temperature and relative humidity sufficiently within the container to optimize the pest eradication process, and to prevent extremes and substantial changes from existing seasonal conditions to which the collections have become habituated;"	Monitor the oxygen, temperature, and RH levels within the enclosure throughout the treatment period and record conditions for submittal to the NPS;"	Ensure the safety of contractors and staff in proximity to low oxygen conditions during and following treatment by monitoring and ensuring adequate ventilation.
Pests known to be present in the Vanderbilt house and collections include the varied carpet beetle (Anthrenus verbasci), odd beetle (Thylodrias contractus), black carpet beetle (Attagenus spp.), and clothes moth (Tinea pellionella / Tineola bisselliella).  Bidders are cautioned to confirm these identifications prior to proposing adequate treatment times.

FAR 52.212-3 can be found at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/loadmainre.html.</p>
<p>REJECTION OF PROPOSAL: Failure to demonstrate compliance with the requirements above will be cause to reject the proposal without further discussions.</p>
<p><br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, cost, and other factors considered. The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best technical and price terms. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offerors and are listed in order of importance: (1) Technical Conformance to Specifications, (2) Price Including Freight/Shipping Costs. Technical evaluation will include examination of the product literature and technical features for conformance with the requirements of the Product Description. Evaluation of products will be on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. An offer that does not provide sufficient information to describe the capacity to meet the RFQ's technical evaluation criteria can result in failure of this evaluation factor. Offers must clearly identify the item by manufacturer name, make, model number and include descriptive literature such as illustrations and drawings, etc. to clearly demonstrate/describe the product meets the requirement of the Commercial Item Description.</p>
<p>The offeror shall extend to the Government the full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale, provided such warranty is available at no additional cost to the Government. Acceptance of the standard commercial warranty does not waive the Government's rights under the Inspection clause nor does it limit the Government's right with regard to the other terms and conditions of this contract. In the event of a conflict, the terms and conditions of the contract shall take precedence over the standard commercial warranty. The contractor shall provide a copy of its standard commercial warranty (if applicable) with this response.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>judicial challenge.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>15.4 Volume II - Technical Proposal</p>
<p>Include all required information, EXCLUDING any reference to price. Each technical proposal must be sufficiently specific, detailed and complete to clearly and fully demonstrate to the government that the offeror has a thorough knowledge and understanding of the technical requirements. Offerors, which do not present sufficient information to permit complete technical evaluation by the government, may be determined technically unacceptable. Previously submitted data will not be used in the evaluation of proposals. Include all information required by Attachment J.3, Technical Evaluation Criteria.</p>
<p>The proposal shall concisely describe the offeror's response to the requirements of the solicitation. Elaborate artwork, expensive paper or bindings, and expensive visual or other aids are not necessary or encouraged.</p>
<p>15.4.1 Pages containing text shall be typewritten or printed on 8 &frac12; x 11 or 8 x 10 &frac12; inch paper, with at least single spacing. Type size for text shall be no smaller than 10 point, with not more than an average of twelve (12) characters per linear inch (12 pitch), with proportional spacing permitted. Type size for figures and tables shall be no smaller than 5 point, 20 pitches, with proportional spacing permitted. Margins on all four edges of each page will be at least one inch. A page printed on both sides shall be counted as two pages. A maximum of ten fold out pages no larger than 11 x 10 x17 inches will be allowed as an appendix to the technical volume. Proposals shall not be supplemented by a package or reference or reference documents. Pages exceeding the limitations will be removed from the proposal by the Contracting Officer and returned to the offeror to ensure that they are not evaluated. Other deviations from the instructions will be reviewed by the Contracting Officer to ensure that no offeror receives a competitive advantage. Deviations resulting in a competitive advantage for an offeror will result in the proposal being returned to the offeror as noncompliant with the RFP requirements.</p>
<p>15.4.2 All pages in the proposal shall be numbered and identified with the proposal's name (CGC MORGENTHAU (WHEC 722) Unplanned Dockside Repairs, RFP number, and date of proposal). Subsequent revisions should be similarly identified to show revision number and date. A table of contents should be provided with figures and tables listed separately where necessary. (These pages are excluded from the page count.)</p>
<p>52.16-1 TYPE OF CONTRACT (APR 1984)<br />The Government contemplates award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract.<br />52.233-2 SERVICE OF PROTEST (AUG 1996)<br />(a) Protests, as defined in section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed directly with an agency, and copies of any protests that are filed with the General Accounting Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from:<br />USCG, Command<br />Surface Forces Logistics Centers<br />LRE-C&amp;PD2<br />1301 Clay Street<br />Oakland, CA 946120<br />(b) The copy of any protest shall be received in the office designated above within one day of filing a protest with the GAO.<br />52.215-5 Facsimile Proposals (Oct 1997) <br />(a) Definition. "Facsimile proposal," as used in this provision, means a proposal, revision or modification of a proposal, or withdrawal of a proposal that is transmitted to and received by the Government via facsimile machine. <br />(b) Offerors may submit facsimile proposals as responses to this solicitation. Facsimile proposals are subject to the same rules as paper proposals. <br />(c) The telephone number of receiving facsimile equipment is: (510) 637-5978. <br />(d) If any portion of a facsimile proposal received by the Contracting Officer is unreadable to the degree that conformance to the essential requirements of the solicitation cannot be ascertained from the document- <br />(1) The Contracting Officer immediately shall notify the offeror and permit the offeror to resubmit the proposal; <br />(2) The method and time for resubmission shall be prescribed by the Contracting Officer after consultation with the offeror; and</p>
<p><br />(3) The resubmission shall be considered as if it were received at the date and time of the original unreadable submission for the purpose of determining timeliness, provided the offeror complies with the time and format requirements for resubmission prescribed by the Contracting Officer. <br />(e) The Government reserves the right to make award solely on the facsimile proposal. However, if requested to do so by the Contracting Officer, the apparently successful offeror promptly shall submit the complete original signed proposal. <br />(End of provision) <br />52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />PRICE -<br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical <br />quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.</p>
<p><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(d) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The lack of on-site crane support presents safety issues when CBIRF must make do with less than optimal  equipment. Further, the extra time required to construct and demolish rubble piles with limited equipment assets places a scheduling strain on the training team.  The need to move a heavy load by light weight equipment stresses the equipment and has resulted in breakage exceeding normal operating conditions.   Crane operations are also built into training for the Rescue Marines so that they can maintain this skill set.ObjectivesThe objective of having a crane on site is to allow for safe movement during set up and tear down of training scenarios on the south side of the Downey Responder Training Facility (DRTF).  Tech Rescue also trains with crane support on weight estimation, proper rigging, and movement of heavy materials with crane support during one of their annual training periods.Scope	Concrete blocks, beams and walls will be safely moved using a contractor  provided crane and rigging already at the DRTF to relocate and reorganize the blocks, beams,  and walls  for upcoming training.  This will be done in (4) one week periods throughout the year.  Actual dates will be coordinated with the awarded contractor approximately 15-20 days prior to the needed periods.  Due to the terrain at the work site, only Rough-Terrain Cranes should be utilized.TasksThe Contractor will provide a crane with operator to meet the below listed requirements.
1.	50 tons lifting capacity2.	Extending boom 3.	Boom elevation from approximately -4 degrees to 75 degrees4.	Independent outriggers5.	360 degree operation6.	Fueled and refueled by Contractor.7.	On-site routine preventive maintenance of the crane8.	Operator to operate and maintain crane (0730-1630) for a standard working day of 8 hours (one hour for lunch). No Overtime.DeliveryThe contractor must have a crane that meets the above requirements delivered to the work  site at the beginning of the work period. An operator must be on site at the beginning of the work period as listed in the tasks section.Once the contract is awarded, DRTF staff will coordinate actual required dates with the Contractor for use.  This will be one week periods beginning on a Monday and ending on a Friday for a 40 hour work week.  No overtime will be utilized.Equipment, or Information (GFP, GFM, GFE, or GFI)The DRTF staff will provide all rigging required to allow manipulation of concrete pieces at the site.SecurityThe crane operator must be a US Citizen or have a Government issued work Visa.   Ten days prior to work commencing the DRTF staff will require an I-9 Employment Form for the crane operator to get a Restricted Area Pass for him during the work period.  Travel 	Travel to and from the worksite is the responsibility of the contractor.
Work Site  and Period of PerformanceAll work will be performed in the vicinity of  the DRTF (Bldg 2083) located on Stump Neck Annex of Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head, Md.  The (4) one week periods will be between 1 June, 2010 and 30 September, 2010.  Additional option years will require (4) one week periods; (1) week per quarter for the entire fiscal year.

Marine Corps Special Operations Command, Camp Lejeune North Carolina, has a one-time requirement to procure: 

CLIN 0001: Technical Support Services

Offers shall depict each labor category, quantity per category, and hourly rate/daily required to provide the requested services.

Delivery: Period of performance will begin May 31, 2010 and end no later than June 11, 2010.

The Government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract. The evaluation factors for this RFQ are price, technical (technical approach, understanding the requirement, technical plan/methodology), delivery date, relevant (similar services provided within the past three years) and satisfactory past performance, and price.  Categorically, evaluation factors will be weighed in this order of precedence; technical, delivery date, and past performance. The Government intends to make award based on lowest price technically acceptable. 

Standard Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Language

-	Use of LPTA is required by AI 13.106-100.
-	LPTA may not be appropriate for use where high quality is required and that factor can not otherwise be reduced to an acceptable/non-acceptable factor under an LPTA analysis (i.e. it is generally appropriate for simple products or services).

52.212-2 Evaluation  Commercial Items. (select appropriate bold language below)

a.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  For this solicitation, the most advantageous offer for the government will be the responsible, lowest-priced, technically acceptable offeror considering the following factors:

[Choose from among the following factors; choose fewer if acquisition is for a simple product or service and we need to award quickly; the following list is not all-inclusive.]

1. Price; [mandatory]
2. Delivery; 
3. Technical; 
4. Past Performance; [Past performance is only valuable if we get relevant and recent past performance information.  This must be explained to vendors  e.g. Submit past performance references from three or more customers for projects /services performed within the last three years that were for the same or similar items or services described in this solicitation.  We can consider a shorter period of time if there are numerous actions or many vendors providing the required items.  If a contractor has no experience then you don't hold that against them - they receive a neutral rating which is acceptable.  They are not acceptable if they have had negative past performance.  Personal knowledge of the contracting officer MAY be considered.]
5.  Experience; [Similar to past performance but a distinct factor; it represents the experience they have in the industry, and not necessarily how they have performed on previous contracts; the solicitation should say what minimum level experience is required IOT be acceptable, e.g., 3 yrs direct or related experience.] 
6.  Management/Personnel; [If this is a factor we want to consider, the solicitation must list the requirements for management or personnel so that the offer will know what is acceptable.] 

Proposals will be evaluated in an efficient and minimally burdensome fashion.  The offeror must be acceptable in all factors listed to be considered technically acceptable.  The Government will then make award to the lowest priced of the technically acceptable vendors. 

OR
 
Proposals will be evaluated in an efficient and minimally burdensome fashion.  The offeror must be acceptable in all factors listed to be considered technically acceptable.  The Government will select the vendor whose quote is the lowest price of the technically acceptable quotes in order to negotiate details.  If agreement can not be reached with that vendor, the Government will move on to the next lowest priced, technically acceptable vendor.   

[If applicable, add the following]  While not a factor for determination of technical acceptability, contractors are reminded that this solicitation contains (DFARS 252.225-7024, Requirement for Products or Services from Iraq or Afghanistan) OR (DFARS 252.225-7026, Acquisition Restricted to Products or Services from Iraq or Afghanistan).  In order to receive consideration for award under this solicitation, offerors must comply with this clause.

The following questions were posed, along with their responses: <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 1:</span></strong> <br />The 2000GB drives are not available to the market yet. Can our proposal include an expansion chassis to the 4U to equal 80TB?&nbsp;<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response 1:</span></strong>&nbsp;<br />No, we don't have the space in our rack for an expansion&nbsp;chassis. The&nbsp; maximum height we have available is 4U. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 2:</span></strong> <br />Our 4 U enclosure supports 48x500GB for 24 TB of &lsquo;raw&rsquo; storage. With dual parity RAID, we support 21 TB of usable capacity. Depending on the data stored, with compression and data deduplication, we can provide 2X to over 50X increase in capacity (resulting in 48TB to 1 PB+ in usable capacity) Will this satisfy your requirement? <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response 2:</span></strong> <br />No, this will not satisfy our requirements. We will be performing compression to exceed the physical raw storage capacity. Our physical raw storage capacity is &gt;= 80TB.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DoD) SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PROGRAM 2010.2. Small high-technology firms are encouraged to submit proposals to DoD for R&amp;D projects with both military and commercial applications in response to SBIR solicitation 2010.2, which will be publicly released on the DoD SBIR Web Site (http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/sbir) on Apr 21, 2010. The 2010.2 SBIR Solicitation will open for receipt of proposals on May 19, 2010 and will close at 6:00 AM EASTERN TIME, Jun 23, 2010. NOTE: Proposals received after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3). Submissions must include the proposal cover sheets, technical proposal, Company Commercialization Report, and cost proposal to be considered a complete proposal. Six DoD components will participate in the 2010.2 solicitation - Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Defense Microelectronics Agency (DMEA), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). The solicitation lists all the R&amp;D topics under which DoD is seeking proposals, and also contains detailed information on the parameters of the SBIR program and how to submit a proposal. Small firms apply first for a six-month phase I award of $70,000 to $150,000 (unless otherwise specified in the component instructions) to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of a particular concept. If phase I proves successful, the firm may be invited to apply for a two-year phase II award of $500,000 to $1,000,000 to further develop the concept. Proposals must be submitted via the DOD SBIR website at &lsquo;http://www.dodsbir.net/submission' following the instructions contained in the solicitation, including the instructions specified in the solicitation for the DoD component to which you are applying. Offerors bear the risk of website inaccessibility due to heavy usage in the final hours before the solicitation closing time, so plan ahead and submit early.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DoD) SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PROGRAM 2010.2. Small high-technology firms are encouraged to submit proposals to DoD for R&amp;D projects with both military and commercial applications in response to SBIR solicitation 2010.2, which will be publicly released on the DoD SBIR Web Site (http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/sbir) on Apr 21, 2010. The 2010.2 SBIR Solicitation will open for receipt of proposals on May 19, 2010 and will close at 6:00 AM EASTERN TIME, Jun 23, 2010. NOTE: Proposals received after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3). Submissions must include the proposal cover sheets, technical proposal, Company Commercialization Report, and cost proposal to be considered a complete proposal. Six DoD components will participate in the 2010.2 solicitation - Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Defense Microelectronics Agency (DMEA), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). The solicitation lists all the R&amp;D topics under which DoD is seeking proposals, and also contains detailed information on the parameters of the SBIR program and how to submit a proposal. Small firms apply first for a six-month phase I award of $70,000 to $150,000 (unless otherwise specified in the component instructions) to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of a particular concept.

<DESC>THE PURPUSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO IDENTIFY THAT THIS REQUIREMENT IS ANTICIPATED TO BE LIMITED COMPETITION AS A RESULT OF THE REQUIREMENT TO USE A BRAND NAME COMPUTER (DUROS 1002) AS A COMPONENT.<br /><br /><br />Description
<p>This Sources Sought Synopsis constitutes a request for information to assist the Air Force in conducting market research of industry to identify potential sources that meet Air Force requirements. 500 CBSS/GBLB, the Ground Theater Air Control-System Support Office (GTACS-SSO) located at Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC) is requesting information from all businesses to assist in the planning for the acquisition of Voice Control Access System -Touchscreen (VCAS-TS)hardware for the AN/TYQ-23 (v)5 operations module (OM). Any set aside and small business programs decisions will be made after market research is complete.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>a. Current AN/TYQ-23 (v)5 trackball/mouse arrangement does not allow operators to effectively manipulate command assets to coordinate/deconflict air space issues during peak flying times. Operators cannot control the mouse rapidly enough to perform the various switch actions required for manipulating the air picture and connecting them via telephone and radio to aircraft and outside air traffic control, command and control, and sister service organizations. The Modular Control Equipment (MCE), AN/TYQ-23(v)5, was produced for the United States Air Force (USAF). Seventy MCE OMs' were functionally upgraded from the (v)3 version and remain in active service.</p>
<p>b. The previous version of the OM (TYQ-23(v)3) had separate touchscreen panels for communication control and air picture manipulation, allowing the operator to use both hands to control these functions. The current configuration places both of these functions on one screen, controlled by one mouse/trackball.</p>
<p>c. The (v)3 to (v)5 upgrade included the capability to integrate software applications, running on the open architecture internal or external System Server Unit (SSU) with the native OM operational software system running in the legacy AYK&shy;14 Computer Units (CUs).</p>
<p>d. In 2006, Northrop Grumman Engineering Systems (NGES) developed an engineering solution for the VCAS-TS to address the above requirement which was incorporated into the AN/TYQ-23(v)5. The Air Force will use that engineering solution for fleetwide modifications to the entire AN/TYQ-23 fleet (70ea systems). The Air Force's immediate VCAS-TS requirement will meet the specific government technical drawing package, which will be provided.</p>
<p>Requirements<br />a. Produce,&nbsp;and deliver (76ea) VCAS-TS kits for the AN/TYQ-23 (v)5 OM per the VCAS-TS Technical Drawing Package (TDP) provided by the US Government (USG). The first production unit will be the First Article. Relevant CDRL's will be provided.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Delivery</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quantity</span><br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First Article&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 EA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Initial Production Buy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 EA</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Option Year I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 60 EA<br /><br />b. This is not a new design effort and will not address any current system deficiencies or implement corrections.&nbsp;<br />c. No changes to VCAS -TS computer operating system or applications software are anticipated. <br />d. Master copies of the new firmware for this kit will be provided by the USG and the contractor shall accurately reproduce the firmware in the quantities required (as part of kit delivery).<br />e. The contractor shall develop Special Packing Instructions (SPI) for the VCAS-TS Kit IAW MIL-STD-2073, Appendix E. The USG will approve the SPI. The contractor shall package the VCAS-TS Kits IAW the approved SPI.<br /><br />Requested Responses</p>
<p>Each interested entity that has the capability to meet the production requirements for VCAS-TS hereby has the opportunity to provide supporting rationale to that effect. Each interested entity that has the capability to meet any specific (or all)of the requirements is requested to provide the following information to help the Air Force determine prospective contractors:</p>

<DESC>ANSWERS TO VENDOR QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PWS ARE LISTED BELOW. <br /><br />1. QUESTION: Under 1.23.1., last sentence, Can this be done by phone / fax or does it have to be done in person? <br /><br />RESPONSE: Integration Support duties must be done in person. This is an Air Force Inspector General compliance checklist item. <br /><br />2. QUESTION: Under 1.23.1.1., How much notice will be given for Mass briefings? <br /><br />RESPONSE: The weather contractor is almost always notified several days in advance of Mass aircrew briefings. Historically, Mass aircrew weather briefings have occurred several times a year. Mass aircrew briefings are normally associated with Parents Weekend (September), USAFA Graduation (May) activities, and organized flying competitions. <br /><br />3. QUESTION: Is there more specific language about how much experience / minimum qualifications that personnel need to fill positions other than what is listed in 1.19.2.? <br /><br />RESPONSE: <br />Specific academic and training requirements are not specified by the Government, however all contractor personnel must be certified Weather Forecasters. The Government typically does not dictate to the contractor the qualifications their personnel must have unless it is mandated by AFI, statute or DoD regulation. The Air Force Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is available via Air Force e-publishing on the internet. All qualification and training requirements for Air Force Weather Forecasters can be located at this site. The AFSC for weather technicians is 1W0XX. <br /><br />4. QUESTION: Do you need a forecaster and an observer working at the same time or if someone is dual-qualified can they work with the Station Chief helping out as needed? There may be times when the Station Chief is doing a brief and the personnel will be by themselves. <br /><br />RESPONSE: This is a staffing question concerning time management and risk. Conceivably, there may be times when only a contract weather technician is in the weather station as other personnel may be in the flying squadrons performing Integration Support duties. Please note, we no longer have Air Force "weather observers". All contractor personnel shall be dual-qualified in weather observing and forecasting tasks, and shall be capable of performing both Airfield Services Element duties and Mission Weather Element duties as the situation dictates. <br /><br />5. Question: Will the prime (contractor) be required to hold a facility clearance<br />to bid on the solicitation?<br />Response: No, however a DD-254 Department of Defense Contract Security Classification Specification will be included in the contract solicitation addressing security of specified documents. Access to secret material during the solicitation and response phase of the acquisition is not required. The document will be completed upon contract award. Coordination with Security Forces should take less than two weeks. <br /><br />6. Question: Will the contract personnel be required to hold SECRET or TOP SECRET clearances to work on this contract?<br />Response: Only personnel briefing classified information in the Emergency Operations Center are required to hold a SECRET clearance. Paragraph 1.21.2 specifies that approximately 3 personnel will need a SECRET security clearance.
<p>7. Question: Which positions in the contract will require the clearance?<br />Response: Positions are not specified. The individuals performing the briefings need to be knowledgeable and possess the appropriate clearance.&nbsp; <br /><br />8. Question. Will the USAFA consider CPFF vice FFP as an alternative consideration for the proposed CLIN structure for the Meteorological Services Contract for CLIN XXX1 (Meteorological Services) and CLIN XXX2 (Contingency/After-Hours Services)?</p>
<p>Comment/Position Support: Because this is a Services based requirement contract for an operational mission, it may be difficult to estimate the ever changing requirements for support. Although the PWS captures the workload from 2007-2009, this may not hold true in the future as support requirements for flight requirements tend to be fluid and ever changing. SRC currently provides Meteorological Services for the National Science Foundation for flight operations on Antarctica. As such, we have firsthand experience in supporting flight operations requirements as proposed in the PWS. SRC believes a CPFF or Time and Material contract would be more efficient for seamless transition, continuous services and cost effectiveness. Utilizing FFP the government will pay the full amount awarded by the contract, regardless of the number of the requirements actually supported. However, utilizing a CPFF or T&amp;M model, the government will fund only the amount necessary to support the specific level of effort (LOE) required.</p>
<p>a. A typical firm fixed price (FFP) effort generally requires a higher quantity of price breaks for supported requirements as the risks are all supported by the contractor. With CPFF or T&amp;M, the risks are shared and the cost is generally lower. Based upon an FFP model, price breaks are calculated as an estimate based on estimated requirements. SRC believes (and has demonstrated via past performance) that efficiencies to the government both in schedule and in pricing can be realized through pricing on an at-cost basis plus fixed fee for labor and materials, paying only for actual equipment and services provided. Potential savings are passed on to the Government with a CPFF model. However, within an FFP model, the economy is generally realized by the contractor.</p>
<p>b. A CPFF effort allows for flexibility of support requirements. The government can direct the requirements for the time period based on funding and system availability. This would not negate the support to combat failures or systems requiring repair/maintenance due to unforeseen circumstances, only provide a more accurate definition of requirements for routine or cyclic service. Out of cycle support continues without impact.<br /><br />c. Based on our knowledge and experience supporting flight operations on Antarctica and our support for Navy ASOS systems, requirements occasionally require crisis management actions due to unforeseen budget cuts, expanded flight operations, or weather conditions. This could potentially result in a significant increase the cost to the government as a FFP effort but would be at cost with a CPFF effort.</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Firm fixed-priced (FFP) contracts are suitable for acquiring services that have detailed specifications such as the USAFA Meteorological Services. The current contract is a FFP contract with a cost reimbursable CLIN for travel and equipment repair costs. FFP has worked well during the current and previous contracts and the majority of DoD weather contracts are FFP. This is the Government's preferred contract type which does place more risk on the contractor, while providing a profit incentive to perform the work efficiently and effectively. To address your concerns about mission fluctuation and ops tempo changes, the misison at the USAFA Airfield does not change dramatically.</p>
<p>9. QUESTION: Is the level of effort for the description of services in the PWS commensurate with that currently provided by the 306 OSS Contract Weather Team? <br /><br />RESPONSE: Changes include: The AN/FMQ-19, Automatic Meteorological Station, has been installed and several legacy weather systems were decommissioned. <br />The taking of manual surface weather observations changed to monitoring the generation of automated surface weather observations and augmenting the automated observation as required. <br />Observed lightning weather warning areas increased. Observed weather advisory criteria decreased. The Mission Execution Forecast (MEF) process was developed and refined. <br />CDRL requirements increased from 16 to 30 although most of the increase was a result of a refinement of the requirements. <br />USAFA reinstituted a summer Combat Skills Training program for Cadets. This program has multiple training venues both on and off USAFA and resulted in an increased production of observed lightning warnings and weather watch of Cadet ground training programs. <br />A new USAFA Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAV)/Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) program began in 2009. The contractor supports this program with MEFs and provides Missionwatch of the program during flying periods.</p>
<p>10. QUESTION: What is the current staffing complement of the 306 OSS Contract Weather Team? <br /><br />RESPONSE: Cannot release this information. How the contractor chooses to staff the operation is considered proprietary. <br /><br />11. QUESTION: What is the breakdown (Superintendent, Commandant of Cadets, 10 ABW/CC, and 306 FTG/CC) of the 19 Standup (Staff, Seasonal, Mission) Weather Briefings per month as disclosed in Appendix of the PWS?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Currently, command staff briefings are as follows: The 10 ABW Staff Meeting is on Tuesday; The Superintendent's Staff meeting is on Wednesday; and The Commandant of Cadets' and 306 FTG Staff meetings are on Thursday. Seasonal and mission briefings round out the total. Paragraph 1.24 and its subparagraphs outline weather briefing duties.</p>
<p>12. QUESTION: What is the administrative burden of preparing and submitting all required reports in the CDRL to the meteorological services QAP?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: This considered a moderate to significant administrative burden associated with completing CDRL reporting requirements. Probably the most significant CDRL requirements are the Standardization and Evaluation Program for Weather Operations Compliance and Performance Self-Inspection Checklists. Although these are annual CDRL requirements, completing the checklists requires considerable thought and a detailed written analysis of every checklist item. The three checklists contain more than 130 questions combined. The Air Force Chief of Staff has directed a re-emphasis in establishing a compliance culture across the Air Force.</p>
<p>13. QUESTION: Who is the manufacturer for the USAFA High Wind Alert System? When was it installed? What is the Mean Time Between Failure for the system and the current Availability of the system? Is training available from the vendor for this system? How much was spent for parts on this system in 2009?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: The USAFA High wind Alert System was assembled and installed by Campbell Scientific, Inc., of Logan, UT in 2000. The government purchased a new server in 2008. All 12 stations are operating normally. Over the past 3 years, the government purchased a few small replacement parts, primarily batteries, for all 12 stations. The contractor installed the new batteries and disposed of the old batteries. One wind bird was repaired by the contractor in 2009. The system has been exceptionally robust and reliable. USAFA High Wind Alert data can be seen at this link: http://www.usafa.edu/tu/306ftg/weather/hwas.html. The new contract requires the contractor to perform preventive maintenance and coordinate repair, however the government will pay via GPC or purchase order all part, material and labor costs for repairs.<br />The system is relatively simple to operate, thus there is no formal training. However, the vendor is available via telephone for consults and training to assist the user.</p>
<p>14. QUESTION: What is the model of the Vaisala Lightning Detection System (LDS)? When was it installed? What modifications have been made to the system since installation? What is the Mean Time Between Failure for the system and the current Availability of the system? Is training available from the vendor for this system? How much was spent for parts on this system in 2009?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: The Vaisala LDS was installed in 1999 and was upgraded in Dec 2006. The Vaisala LDS consists of several components including a SL 2100 Earth Station, a Vaisala EFM 550, a PLWS Display Unit, a PLWS Display Unit, and an outside antenna. The software is Vaisala's Thunderstorm Warning System TWX 300. The system is operating normally. Vaisala can be contacted regarding training on the TWX 300 software. NLDN data for east-central Colorado is continually downloaded via satellite. (The data feed is funded under a National Weather Service contract.) The government pays an annual Satellite Communications Fee of $912, and purchases an annual Satellite Service Agreement of $600. No LDS components were replaced in 2009. The Vaisala system has been exceptionally robust and reliable.</p>
<p>15. QUESTION: How critical are the USAFA High Wind Alert and Vaisala Lightning Detection Systems for the Met Operations?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Supported USAFA and 306 FTG agencies view both systems as critical to safe operations at USAFA even though both systems are non-standard Air Force weather sensing systems. Both systems were installed as a direct result of weather-caused mishaps.</p>
<p>16. QUESTION: Can we get a copy of 306 FTGI 15-101?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Yes. It will be attached to the solicitation.</p>
<p>17. QUESTION: Can we get a copy of the standard operating procedures used by the 306 OSS Contract Weather Team?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: The 306 OSS standard operating procedures are not necessary to submit a proposal on the contract. They will be provided to the successful contractor.</p>

RFP 98210AR007   Response to Questions
1.	Are the cameras for internet broadcast only or is the event being taped as well? If so, what format?	The cameras will be used both for internet broadcast and for taping the event to be used in eventual video productions for training and DVDs of conference highlights.  Format specifications for video production will be determined by the video producers who have yet to be identified for the project.  There is a general preference on format for cameras that will capture video in High Definition (HD) onto a hard drive and Standard Definition (SD) onto a DV Cam tape.  
2.	Is FWS providing the capture & streaming equipment or will it be part of the quote?
The preference for all audio-visual and technical equipment is for the conference facility to provide the equipment (either directly or through sub-contracting) along with the necessary accessories and support required to use the equipment.  Exact specifications required for the capture and streaming elements of the conference will be dependent on decisions from third party facilitators yet to be identified.  
3.	Is FWS supplying and hosting the server space that will be streaming the media?
No.  The FWS does have server capacity in the area of Denver, CO, and if the conference facility was unable to provide server capacity, the FWS would explore the necessary options.
4.	How fancy are you looking to get with the dinner/reception lighting?  Basic, mid-range, or high-end?  Can you provide any specifics regarding what you have done in the past?
Creative mid-range.  The primary high-end emphasis for dinner/reception and special event productions will be on the content and multimedia features that the lighting should compliment.  For example, proposals for say a compelling, moderate set-up that is powered from a creative renewable energy source will score higher than a proposal for an elaborate, high-end lighting design with no creative connection to the content and theme of the conference.
5.	With regards to the satellite uplink/downlink capabilities.  Does FWS have a satellite truck that you will be bringing to support this, or do you want the facility to address subcontracting this with an outside vendor?  If you have a truck, can you provide data on the maximum distance the truck can be parked outside the ballroom?  Also, which general location in the sky will the truck need to face to reach your satellite?  How much power do you require to the truck?
The FWS does not have a satellite truck that will be brought to the conference site.  The FWS is interested in proposals that feature facilities with satellite uplink/downlink capabilities or subcontracting possibilities with an outside vendor.  The FWS does have a satellite network managed out of the National Conservation Training Center in Shepherdstown, WV that can receive a feed over the internet and then broadcast that feed over the FWS satellite network.  This means that broadcasting over the network is possible regardless of the conference facilities' satellite capabilities but with the level of quality that comes with using internet connection only to broadcast the sessions of the conference.
6.	Will guest lodging be on the master bill, and therefore included in the cost proposal?  Or do your guests pay individually for their per diem?  Please advise if I should exclude this from the proposal.
Guests will pay individually for their per diem.  The local per diem rate will be weighed in as a part of the total cost to the Government in the price evaluation. 
7.	For the Exhibition space, will you require pipe/drape services between the tables, or strictly draped tables without any separating curtains?  If so, should that be included in the cost proposal?
The tables for the Exhibition space should be draped without separating curtains.
8.	Format of Technical Proposal.  Would you prefer that the annex documents be indexed at the end of the technical proposal and contained within the same electronic file, or sent as separate electronic files?
Either format is acceptable.
9.	For the dinner receptions, are these receptions to be substituted for dinner and should contain heavy enough food to satisfy guests not attending dinner?  Or will guests go to dinner after the receptions?
The dinner receptions are expected to contain food to satisfy guests; attendees will not go to dinner after the receptions.
10.	The entire "window" of date flexibility i.e. very earliest to very latest the March and June events can convene?
The earliest that the conference can convene is the week beginning March 13, 2011, and the latest that we can convene is the week beginning June 26, 2011.
11.	The entire flexibility in the day of the week arrival departure pattern; also, are weekends doable?
The day of the week arrival/departure pattern is set and not flexible.  Weekends are not an option for this conference.
12.	Is the week immediately before and after July 4 acceptable? IE Mon. is July 4; can the major arrival be on Tuesday July 5?
The week immediately before July 4, June 26-July 1, 2011 is acceptable and is the latest date that the conference can convene.  Therefore, the week of July 4-8, 2011 is not acceptable.
13.	What is the budget or estimate for spending on food and beverage?
The budget estimate for spending on food and beverage can roughly be calculated based on the location's per diem rate and the number of people estimated to be provided food and beverage in the statement of work.
14.	I know often the government cannot sign for a food and beverage minimum, will you be signing a contract with an food and beverage minimum?
We will not be signing a contract with a food and beverage minimum.
15.	Does this conference provide Hosted Alcohol during the Receptions or just Cash Bars?
The conference will most likely provide Cash Bars.  If non-governmental sponsors for receptions are found, Hosted Alcohol for sponsored-events would become a viable option.
16.	Does this conference use a Decorator Company for their Table Top Exhibition Space?  If so, which company?
This conference has only been held once in the past (1998) and there are no records of whether a Decorator Company was used previously or not.
17.	Where has this conference been held in the past?  Can you please share any history regarding guest rooms picked up or previous attendance numbers?
This conference has only been held once in the past at the Keystone Resort and Conference Center in Keystone, Colorado in October 1998.  Approximately 850 attendees were invited and present at the conference in 1998.  
18.	Does the conference require complimentary meeting space?  Can the group accept complimentary meeting space?
The space requirements for the conference are detailed in the statement of work that is available.  The inclusion of complimentary meeting space as part of meeting those requirements would be welcomed and evaluated in the context of evaluation criteria.
19.	If so, would the group allow a rebate in the guest room rate to cover the cost of meeting space rental?  If not, what is the budget or historical average spend for meeting space rental?
We will not allow a rebate in the guest room rate to cover the cost of meeting space rental.  This conference has only been held once in the past (1998) and there are no records of what was spent for meeting space rental.

(d)  Visit request must be faxed to 252.464.8867 at least three (3) working days prior to the visit.  
(e)  Although a security clearance is not required for the site visit, all contractor representatives must be U.S. citizens and will be required to furnish a valid driver's license or other generally acceptable form of picture identification for issuance of a visitors badge allowing for entrance into the facility.  Substitution of personnel is not allowed.  Photography, including cellular telephones with camera capability, and/or the use of recording devices within the facility is strictly prohibited.
(f)  Additional information regarding access to the Air Station and FRC East is available by phone at 252.464.7397 or by accessing the FRC East web-site at http://www.navair.navy.mil/frce/Visit.html.  Failure to submit the proper visit request information may result in denial of access to the facility.  Additional site visits will not be scheduled as a result of such failure.
4.  The MCAS Cherry Point main gate is located off NC State Highway 101, Havelock, NC.  Visitors without proper vehicle identification are required to check-in at the visitor's center adjacent to the main gate.  Once through the Main Gate, proceed to the assembly area identified in 3(a) above.   Directions from the main gate to the assembly area are available upon request at the visitor's center.  Participants should allow at least one hour for check-in at the main gate and travel to the FRC East assembly area.  Participants will depart from the assembly area promptly at 9:30 AM EST. Participants arriving late will NOT be included in the Site Visit.  
5.  Participants will be required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) consisting of hearing protection, eye protection, and safety shoes.  PPE will not be provided by the facility.  Contractor representatives without the appropriate PPE will not be allowed access to the facility and additional site visits will not be scheduled as a result of such failure.
6.  The purpose of the site visit is to allow contractors the opportunity to inspect the site of the existing equipment (where the new equipment is to be installed) in order to be better able to relate to the specification requirements.  The site visit, in conjunction with the work requirements identified in the final specification, should provide contractors a detailed understanding of the requirement.
7.  The site visit is not intended to be a pre-proposal conference and therefore will NOT be an open forum for questions.  Contractors must submit questions concerning, or request clarification of, any aspect of the draft specification electronically via e-mail to john.dijoseph@usmc.mil no later than 20 January 2009.   Comments and questions must reference Request for Quotation M00146-10-T-9023.  
8.  Failure of a contractor to submit questions regarding this requirement or to attend the Site Visit will be construed to mean that the contractor fully understands all requirements of the final specification and Request for Quotation.  In no event will failure of a contractor to submit questions or inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.
9.  Interested contractors should continue to monitor the NECO web sites for additional information and documents relating to this requirement.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL (J&amp;A)<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />SOLE SOURCE<br />SOLICITATION HSCG38-10-Q-500009
<p>Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.3, HSAM 3006.3, CGAP 3006.3 and in accordance with requirements of FAR 6.303-1, the justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR Subpart 6.3 is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 6.303-2 as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a "Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition." - The United States Coast Guard (USCG) Aviation Logistics Center (ALC), Engineering Services Division, Contract Section, Elizabeth City, North Carolina, proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved. - Approval is requested to solicit, on a limited source basis, the purchase of Heads Up Display (HUD) Lab Driver module is for use on MH-60T helicopters. This is anticipated to be a one time purchase of the HUD LAB Driver module to outfit the MH-60T Units.</p>
<p>(3) Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value). - As the Aviation Inventory Control Point (AICP), ALC must provide effective supply support for all Coast Guard aviation units and for the Programmed Depot Maintenance Program. The procurement will be of a fully functioning HUD Lab Driver module (pn: 88104A) and cable (pn: 88116A-00) that has been adapted for use with a computer monitor as opposed to an operational set of night vision goggles. These HUD Lab Driver cables are specifically designed to allow field testing of the HUD system without having to utilize much more expensive HUD night vision goggles to perform daily maintenance. This is anticipated to be a onetime purchase of these components to outfit each air station with the appropriate level of inventory to accomplish field testing. This HUD Lab Driver module and cable will significantly reduce the time and cost associated with ground testing of the HUD and enable troubleshooting in the field to significantly reduce component return for repairs. The estimated total value of this procurement is $</p>
<p>(4) Identification of statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. -The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) or 41USC 253(c) (1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 entitled "Only one responsible source or a limited number of responsible source or a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".</p>
<p>(5) Demonstration that the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. - The HUD was originally designed and developed by Elbit Systems of America (ESA) and they are the only source with the technical expertise, data and engineering knowledge to design and manufacture this HUD Lab Driver module. This module must interface directly with the onboard aircraft HUD which was originally established in the HH 60J cockpit. The module purchase in this acquisition can only be designed and built by ESA due to their unique knowledge and proprietary software/firmware within the HUD assembly itself. There is no opportunity to compete this requirement due to the proprietary information and any potential competition in the future would not be cost effective as this is a onetime design and purchase of these cables with no future requirement planned. <br /><br />(6) Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable. - A combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.603 will be issued via FedBizOps. In <br />accordance with FAR 5.201, the intent to contract for the items will be synopsized via FedBizOpps. If any responses are received as a result of this combined synopsis/solicitation, the file will be documented accordingly and the requirement competed among all eligible offerors. A copy of the combined synopsis/solicitation will be sent to ESA.</p>
<p>(7) Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. - It is the Contracting Officer's opinion that prices ultimately negotiated for this procurement will be determined fair and reasonable based on price analysis for similar items and if necessary cost analysis based upon expert review of other than certified cost and pricing data.</p>
<p>(8) Description of the market research. - Based upon the nature of this acquisition and the one time purchase of these cables limited market research was performed. This is a specifically designed cable, helmet and module assembly that must interface directly to the onboard HUD and only one design will function based on proprietary software and firmware embedded in the HUD system. <br /><br />(9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, i.e., proprietary data packages, etc. - The necessary manufacturing drawings, data, and special tooling are proprietary and available only from the OEM or certified repair facility. The USCG did not purchase the technical data rights as part of the original acquisition for the HUD nor would data rights be available or useful due to proprietary software code. Presently USCG is not planning to obtain the data rights, and/or drawings because of variety of financial and technical ramifications. Therefore, it would be difficult to take steps to foster competition as the manufacturing, performance and acceptance data are proprietary and the USCG does not have adequate technical descriptions. This requirement is necessary in order for the USCG to maintain the capability to adequately support their deployed aircraft and carry out their law enforcement mission.</p>
<p>(10) Listing of the sources, if any that expressed in writing, an interest in the acquisition. - In accordance with FAR 5.201, the intent to contract for the items will be synopsized via FedBizOpps. If any responses are received as a result of this combined snopsis/solicitation, the file will be documented accordingly and the requirement competed among all eligible offerors. A copy of the combined synopsis/solicitation will be sent to ESA.</p>
<p>(11) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent for the supplies or services required. Complete specifications and drawings for the MH-60T are not available to the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard does not possess technical expertise nor were the data rights to spares purchased as part of the initial system acquisition for the MH-60T aircraft. As the Aircraft Inventory Control Point (AICP), ALC is tasked with supporting systems that have been deployed for use in the aviation community. As a result, it would be difficult to foster a competitive procurement effort. However, in an effort to increase competition among affiliates and distributors, MH-60T Product Line members annually attend aviation trade shows, extensive internet database research is conducted, and procurements are advertised in FedBizOps. Responses to the latter are dependent upon the procurement itself. In support of the competition in Contracting Act, ALC established the New Product Development Branch (NPD) and a representative of the NPD Branch are assigned to the MH-60T Product Line. This representative has the responsibility to locate alternate sources of supply/services and alternate acceptable products. Engineering, contracting and New Product Development representatives continuously conduct market research to ensure that companies interested in doing business with the USCG are given every opportunity to compete for our requirements NPD is exploring avenues of reverse engineering some of the hard to find or expensive to repair items. However, this process is lengthy, costly and a labor intensive effort.</p>
