<p>Factor B. Management Approach:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1: Staffing Plan - A staffing plan that clearly demonstrates how the offeror will perform the demand maintenance order, repair, cleaning service, and grounds maintenance for AFH at USAG Yongsan to include but not limited to:</p>
<p>- Labor categories and number of technicians by contract year to support PWS<br />- Recruitment policy and timeline for replacement of technicians<br />- The contractor shall provide the COR with an up-to-date list of employees at all times<br />- Transition strategy between each contract year to include labor categories and number of technicians<br />- In the event of a change of employee, the contractor shall advise the COR of the change to include name and qualifications.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2: Quality Control Plan (QCP) - Submission of a QCP that demonstrates the offeror's approach to conducting comprehensive quality control. The plan shall clearly describe the offeror's quality control methods and practices such as standardized procedures to monitor performance, identify discrepancies, and take corrective action to prevent re-occurrences. As part of the QCP, the Offeror shall identify what items the Offeror will inspect under its comprehensive QC for each task listed in the PRS table.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3: Phase-In Plan (PIP) - Submission of PIP that clearly demonstrates how the offeror will prepare for 100% full performance in accordance with the PWS and by the end of the one (1) month phase in period to include but not limited to:</p>
<p>- All general and administrative (G&amp;A) functions and pre-hiring activities normally accomplished by contractor prior to physical phase-in performance<br />- How the contractor provides required personnel at performance locations, training and implementation on all reports, property control plan, safety plan, services, suspense dates, a time phased and schedule of installation access and procedures needed<br />- How this transition will take place without interruption of ongoing USAG-Yongsan AFH maintenance services.</p>
<p>Factor C. Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the offeror's record of past and current performance to ascertain the probability of successfully performing the required efforts of the PWS. The past performance factor considers the Offeror's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in supplying services that meet the contract requirements. Past performance will be evaluated on an acceptable/unacceptable adjectival ratings as shown below chart when using LPTA basis of award. Offerors are required to identify contracts, both commercial and Government contracts for the same or similar service. The Government may ascertain past performance information on the offeror from sources other than the contracts/references provided.</p>
<p>The following ratings will be used in evaluating Past Performance:</p>
<p>Acceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown (See note below)<br />Unacceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort</p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable" Past Performances will be evaluated on the contractor's list of contracts which they have performed same or similar services relevant to this solicitation's requirement within the last five (5) years as of the released date of the solicitation. Relevant past performance are those that are the "same or similar" services based on size, scope, complexity, and contract type. Offerors' recent and relevant past performance may consist Government and/or commercial contracts for the prime offeror and/or for each major subcontractor who performed during the past five (5) years from the release dated of this RFP. The offeror's past performance will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305(a) (2).</p>
<p>Past performance of offerors will be evaluated based on the following processes:</p>
<p>Review of the detailed explanation submitted by offerors, demonstrating the relevance of the references to the requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Review of each reference in the Past Performance Questionnaire (Attachment X) provided by offerors.</p>
<p>References will be contacted by phone to verify contents in detail explanation and to determine record of compliance with contract requirements, accuracy of reports, technical and quality awards/certificates.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to obtain past performance information from any reasonable source available, including the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) website http://www.ppirs.gov in order to evaluate offerors' past performance. Also CPARS, if applicable, will be used for evaluation of the past performance.</p>
<p>NOTE: As part of the Responsibility Determination, the Contracting Officer will evaluate past performance to determine the offeror's capability to perform the contract. Failure to submit data or lack of any performance history will not in itself be a reason for determination of non- responsibility. The Contracting Officer is not limited to the information provided. The Contracting Officer may use this data along with data obtained from other sources the Contracting Officer determines appropriate to obtain sufficient information on the offeror's past performance to make a responsibility determination.</p>
<p>Factor D. Price: Proposed prices will be evaluated as follows.<br />(a) Price analysis will be conducted for each proposal to ensure completeness, realism, reasonableness and balance. In order to perform price analysis, the Government requires that offerors submit sufficient detail relative to direct and indirect rates, subcontracts, material, equipment, and other direct costs. Price analysis will be performed to determine the total evaluated price to support the selection of the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror. To determine total evaluated price, all fixed priced CLINs, Sub-CLINs and ELINs (as appropriate) will be added to the total extended prices of Requirements<br />The following applies to that evaluation:</p>
<p>i. Completeness. The offeror shall complete the pricing information for all CLINs, Sub- CLINs and ELINs (as appropriate) identified for each year and option year (include total price for all five<br />(5) years). Any underlying assumptions including proposed escalation rates between base and subsequent option periods shall be clearly explained.</p>
<p>ii. Price Realism. Price Analysis in conjunction with Technical Analysis will be used to perform a Price Realism Analysis to determine if the price is realistic for the work to be performed. The proposal will be evaluated using price analysis techniques to determine whether the proposal reflects a thorough understanding of the PWS, and whether the price proposed is realistic for the work to be performed and is consistent with approaches described in the technical and management proposals. Price proposals, which are unrealistically low, will be deemed reflective of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the proposed contractual requirement and may be grounds for rejection of the proposal.</p>
<p>iii. Price Reasonableness. Price should also reflect fair market value and be reasonable when compared to the independent Government estimate, previous prices for same or similar services and/or when compared among other technically acceptable offers.</p>
<p>iv. Unbalanced Pricing. As part of the price evaluation, proposals will be reviewed to identify any unbalanced pricing. IAW FAR 15.404-1(g)(3), Unbalanced Pricing, a proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>Note 1: The Government will examine price proposals for artificially low unit prices. Offers found to be unreasonably high, unrealistically low (an indication of "buy-in"), or unbalanced, may be considered unacceptable and may be rejected on that basis.</p>
<p>Note 2: Price is not scored. The lowest price for award purposes will be the combined total of the base year and all option periods. Price shall include all CLINs, Sub-CLINs and ELINs as listed on the Price Schedule, including option periods. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions. Therefore, offerors are instructed that submitted proposals should contain their best pricing.</p>
<p>Option Clause 52.217-8. As part of price evaluation, the Government will evaluate its option to extend services (FAR Clause 52.217-8 - Option to Extend Services) by adding one-half of the offeror's final option period price to the offeror's total price. Thus, the offeror's total price for the purpose of evaluation will include the base period, 1st option, 2nd option, 3rd option, 4th option, and one-half of the 4th option. Offerors are required only to price the base and four (4) options.<br />Offerors shall not submit a price for the potential one-half year extension of services period.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Proposal Period: The Government anticipates releasing the solicitation on or about 23 December, 2015. The solicitation will be issued via FedBizOps (https://www.fbo.gov/). The response date in this synopsis is not a firm date; please see the solicitation for the actual date.</p>

<DESC><p>Item Description: Acquisition is for NSN 1710-01-189-4161&nbsp; /&nbsp; Aircraft Brake Carrier Assembly. NAICS 336413 - Other Aircraft Part and Auxiliary Equipment: 1,000.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>This solicitation is being issued as an unrestricted RFP. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. As the evaluated price becomes more equal, the relative importance of all other evaluation factors becomes more significant.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP/ on its issue date of December 28, 2015. Hard copies of this solicitation are not available.</p>
<p>FAT Waived Sources: Engineered Arresting Systems (21439)<br />Quantity: 78 units <br />Unit of Issue: Ea.<br />Shipping Information: FOB Origin (First Destination Freight); Inspection/Acceptance Origin<br />Production Delivery Schedule: 430 days ADO w/FAT OR 220 days if FAT is waived.<br />FAT Delivery Schedule: 180 Days ADO</p>

<p><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</strong><br />The resultant Purchase Order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-85 effective 04 DEC 2015.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures at an amount not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000).</p>
<p><strong>STATUTORY AUTHORITY</strong><br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1 (b) (1), Soliciting from a single source and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements. FAR Subpart 6.302-1-Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), provides the authority to sole source.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT</strong><br />This requirement is for the purchase of a service maintenance plan for the NIDCR owned Nikon A1R Confocal Microscope.</p>
<p><strong>Background <br /></strong>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The Laboratory of Cell and Developmental Biology, at the NIDCR, performs research to characterize numerous processes in cell biology using fluorescent proteins to understand normal and defective embryonic development, organ formation, as well as cell migration. Multiple sections in the Laboratory of Cell and Developmental Biology currently perform research characterizing dynamic processes involving salivary gland development, Drosophila development and protein secretion, single cell migration, tumor invasion, and bone and cartilage formation. All of these studies require imaging live samples as organ cultures or within native extracellular matrices in multiple planes in three dimensions on an inverted microscope. In 2014, the NIDCR procured a Nikon A1R Confocal Microscope to perform these studies. With the expiration of the electrical warranty, the NIDCR needs to procure a replacement plan.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives<br /></strong>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure maintenance services for the NIDCR owned Nikon A1R Confocal Microscope. The NIDCR requires this plan to ensure the continued operability of the Microscope.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance</strong><br />Base Year: December 2015 - December 2016<br />Option Year 1: December 2016 - December 2017<br />Option Year 2: December 2017 - December 2018<br />Option Year 3: December 2018 - December 2019<br />Option Year 4: December 2019 - December 2020<br /><br /><strong>Project Description</strong><br />1) The contractor shall provide all labor, material and equipment to provide preventive maintenance for government-owned Nikon A1R confocal microscope Serial# 637200. All maintenance services shall be performed in accordance with the manufacturer's standard commercial maintenance practices.</p>
<p>2) The contractor shall perform not less than one (1) preventative maintenance inspection(s) during the contract period. Service shall be performed by factory trained Field Service representatives. Service shall consist of a thorough cleaning, calibration, adjusting, inspection, lubrication and testing of all equipment in accordance with the manufacturer's latest established service procedures. All equipment shall be operationally tested through at least one (1) complete operating cycle at the end of the preventive maintenance inspection to assure optimum and efficient performance.</p>
<p>3) The contractor shall perform emergency repair services on an unlimited basis during the term of this contract at no additional cost to the Government. Emergency service shall be provided between 8 am and 5 pm Monday through Friday excluding and Federal holidays. Upon receipt of notice that any part of the equipment is not functioning properly, the Contractor shall furnish a qualified factory-trained service representative to inspect the equipment and perform all repairs and adjustments necessary to restore the equipment to normal and efficient operating condition. Emergency service calls shall not replace the necessity for PMI.</p>
<p>4) The contractor shall furnish all required replacement parts at no additional cost to the Government, with the exception of consumable items such as batteries and light bulbs. Parts shall be new or remanufactured to original equipment specifications.</p>
<p>5) The contractor shall provide Software Service in accordance with the manufacturer's latest established service procedures, to include telephone access to technical support for use of program software and trouble shooting of the operating systems, at no additional cost to the Government.

Defective software shall be replaced at no additional cost to the Government.</p>
<p>6) The contractor shall not be responsible for any repairs necessitated by abuse, neglect, vandalism, Acts of God, fire or water. These repairs shall be the subject of a separate purchase order and shall not be performed under this contract.</p>
<p><strong>Other Important Considerations</strong><br />1) Service personnel must be experienced with servicing the Nikon A1R<br />2) Service plan must not void current five (5) year mechanical warranty</p>
<p><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</strong><br />The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10-Market Research. The Government intends to award the Nikon A1R Service Maintenance contract base +4 option years to Nikon Instruments Inc. The Nikon A1R was purchased in FY14 and the original maintenance plan has since expired as well as the one (1) year mechanical warranty. The five (5) year electrical warranty is still active. Nikon does not authorize any service technicians to perform maintenance on their equipment, to do so would void the active electrical warranty. Only authorized Nikon certified and trained technicians can perform services on the A1R. No other contractor provides authorized Nikon technicians to perform maintenance. Nikon is the sole provider of the required maintenance plan for the NIDCR owned A1R Confocal Microscope. A sources sought notice was published in FedBizOpps on November 23rd, 2015, solicitation number NHLBI-CSB-DE-2015-029-KEW.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. To that end NHGRI supports the development of resources and technology that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health. The National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a program designed to address the needs of persons with debilitating medical conditions for which no diagnosis has been found despite an extensive workup. The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The UDP was established to evaluate participants who have undiagnosed medical conditions. UDP participants have generally received extensive diagnostic workups before traveling to the NIH and often have numerous and/or complex medical problems. The UDP program makes use of a diverse set of diagnostic and research techniques both to attempt to find a diagnosis and to generate research projects to advance medical knowledge. Ruro, Inc. has developed the enterprise-grade LIMS 24/7 web platform called UDPics that encompasses project, task and asset management; user role configurability; user-tailored report; extensive audit functionality and information security that is required by the UDP laboratory. UDPics is designed to be the meeting place of laboratory software tools, laboratory hardware, and staff users, allowing previously impossible levels.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Objective:</span></p>
<p>The UDP program makes use of a diverse set of diagnostic and research techniques both to attempt to find a diagnosis and to generate research projects to advance medical knowledge. Ruro, Inc. has developed the enterprise-grade LIMS 24/7 web platform called UDPics that encompasses project, task and asset management; user role configurability; user-tailored report; extensive audit functionality and information security that is required by the UDP laboratory. This system has been designed to be the meeting place of laboratory software tools, laboratory hardware, and staff users, allowing previously impossible levels of secure data access, communication and process efficiency. A collaboration portal of the UDPics system has been designed for outside collaborators to add necessary experimental reports into the system for NIH UDP employees to access and incorporate into the experimental workflow of UDP patients to elucidate the cause of disease.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Important Considerations</span>:</p>
<p>The multi-user nature of NIH's UDP Translational Laboratory, along with its dynamic process structures, engenders a deep set of requirements for any candidate data and project management system. The enterprise-grade LIMS 24/7 platform is a web-based system that encompasses project, task and asset management; user role configurability; user-tailored reporting; extensive audit functionality and information security. LIMS 24/7 is designed to be the meeting place of laboratory software tools, laboratory hardware, and staff users, allowing previously impossible levels of secure data access, communication and process efficiency. In order to further develop a system that completely encompasses the scope of the Undiagnosed Diseases Program, Ruro, Inc. must provide full premium support of UDPics that consists of further system upgrades and revisions. Ruro, Inc. is the developer of the LIMS 24/7 platform for the UDP laboratory called UDPics and is the only provider capable of adding the features to UDP that are required by the UDP laboratory.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Subscription Support</span>:</p>

<DESC>A CONCESSION BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY FOR PASSENGER FERRY, EVENING PASSENGER FERRY, AND FOOD AND BEVERAGE SERVICE AT FORT SUMTER NATIONAL MONUMENT
<p>The National Park Service (NPS) will issue a prospectus for solicitation of offers for a 10 year concession contract to provide for Passenger Ferry, Evening Passenger Ferry, and Food and Beverage Service at Fort Sumter National Monument</p>
<p>Fort Sumter is one of the most iconic sites in American military history as the location where Confederate forces fired the first shots of the Civil War upon Federal troops on April 12, 1861. The Park preserves the remnants of Fort Sumter and commemorates and interprets the opening battle of the Civil War and the Fort's role during the Civil War. The War Department transferred Fort Sumter to the National Park Service on April 28, 1948. The National Park Service accepted jurisdiction of Fort Moultrie in 1960.</p>
<p>The Park includes four geographical areas: Fort Sumter, Fort Moultrie (the site of the first American naval victory over the British in 1776), the Historic Coast Guard Station, and the Visitor Education Center at Liberty Square ("Visitor Education Center"). The Visitor Education Center at Liberty Square, located in downtown Charleston, SC, serves as one departure point for the ferry services to Fort Sumter. Fort Moultrie and the Historic Coast Guard Station are located on Sullivan's Island, SC. <br /><br />Visitors can reach Fort Sumter by ferry service or private boat. Visitors reach Liberty Square, Fort Moultrie, and the Historic Coast Guard Station by automobile.</p>
<p>Fort Sumter National Monument continues to represent an iconic attraction within the Charleston area, serving hundreds of thousands of visitors annually. Additional information on Fort Sumter National Monument can be found at http://www.nps.gov/fosu/</p>
<p>The concession opportunity consists of year-round passenger ferry service, including onboard food and beverage service, and seasonal evening passenger ferry service to Fort Sumter. The ferry will operate in Charleston Harbor and depart from Service-owned docks at Liberty Square adjacent to the Fort Sumter Visitor Education Center and a second ferry departure site in the Mount Pleasant/East Cooper River area.</p>
<p>SITE VISIT</p>
<p>The Service will host a site visit for organizations interested in bidding on this opportunity on Wednesday, January 13, 2016. The site visit will begin at 10:00 AM at Liberty Square with a visit to Fort Sumter and continue afterwards with a visit to Mount Pleasant Waterfront Park and Patriots Point.</p>
<p>The site visit provides interested organizations an overview of the concession operation, along with a tour of the Concession Facilities associated with the Draft Contract. If you plan to attend the site visit, please contact:</p>
<p>Attn: Tony Paladino, Concession Management Specialist<br />Fort Sumter National Monument<br />1214 Middle Street<br />Sullivan's Island, SC 29482<br />anthony_paladino@nps.gov <br />(843) 732-5025</p>

INTRODUCTION: 
The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando, FL, is defining its acquisition strategy for the solicitation and award of visual projectors for the Landing Signal Officer Training Device.
 
	
PROGRAM BACKGROUND:
a.	The 2H111 LSO Trainer (LSOT) is used to simulate the carrier aircraft recovery environment and incorporates a visual system and a simulated LSO station consisting of Landing Signal Officer Display System (LSODS) unit and base station console.

b.	The visual system consists of six Out-The-Window (OTW) projectors, projector support structure, a seven-channel Image Generator (IG) system, and a 270-degree horizontal by 30-degree vertical display screen to display the carrier environment and aircraft targets used in the LSOT simulations.  The current BARCO FS35 projector cannot meet the dark level requirement and project bright light points simultaneously to meet the demands for training on a moonless starless night condition.
  The IG system is a Quantum3D Independence 7000 series system that has seven operational output channels.  The automatic scene alignment system performs an automatic alignment of the projectors to the display screen and the blending of the channel intersections.  The current visual system consists of the following:
	Qty	Description
	1	Image generator with 7 channels
	6	Video projectors, 1 channel of IG for each projector
1	One channel of video for the Pilot Landing Aid Television (PLAT)

<p>Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division intends to issue a Job Order (JO) under a sole source Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00164-12-G-JQ66. The BOA was issued to Raytheon Company, McKinney, TX. Acquisitions under the BOA have been and will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition was the lack of sufficient technical data, restricted software rights, duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source. As a result of this JO the overall contract ceiling for BOA N00164-12-G-JQ66 will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>This JO is anticipated to procure engineering services for technical insertions for upgrades to the Multi-spectral Targeting Systems (MTS) AN/DAS-4 High Definition/Target Location Accuracy (HD/TLA) payloads. The MTS HD/TLA is a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) System which is used on the MQ-9 and MQ-4C unmanned aerial vehicles.</p>

activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design
capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The
approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical

source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification
procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having
jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item
requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is
flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined
adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the

solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that
an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in India. The U.S. Embassy New Delhi and four Consulates in Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Mumbai require a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement. The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks. Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government).
<p>All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract.</p>
<p>The Project Manager must possess a Level 3 language proficiency, which requires an ability to speak English with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations on practical, social, and professional topics.</p>
<p>The Government plans to post the solicitation in this site in late-December 2015. No paper copies will be mailed. The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: The synopsis will be posted for approximately fifteen (15) days. Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately forty-five (45) days to submit proposals. All dates are subject to change and any change will be posted on this site.</p>
<p>A site visit will be scheduled approximately fourteen (14) days after the solicitation is issued at the U.S. Embassy and their facilities in India. A firm date of this site visit will be included in L.1 of the solicitation. Offerors are responsible for entry visa, all travel arrangements, local transportation, and accommodations. Due to space limitations, only two (2) representatives from each firm will be allowed for the site visit.</p>
<p>Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to Michele T Hartigan, Contractor at hartiganmt@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>In accordance with 22 U.S.C. &sect; 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture persons. The contract will be awarded to the best technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.</p>

This market survey is being conducted to identify potential sources interested in providing work which includes all materials, labor, tools, equipment, transportation, supervision, management and other services (including engineering/technical design support) necessary to accomplish non-complex minor construction, maintenance, repair and renovation work on real property with minimum design requirements for Joint Base Langley-Eustis and surrounding federal installations.<br /><br />The 633d Air Base Wing is seeking those firms with a demonstrated history of relevant construction experience where the primary focus is on IDIQ-type contracts with simultaneous performance of multiple projects at differing locations similar to the task order value that will be executed under this contract. Every task order will be competed. Task orders will be firm-fixed price with an estimated targeting award range of $500K to $18M. The estimated magnitude of the entire contract is $250M. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The expected North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurements is 236620 and size standard is $36.5M.; Sector 23 Construction, Subsector 236 Construction of Buildings, Size Standard $36.5M; Subsector 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, Size Standard $36.5M (except Land Subdivision and Dredging and Surface Cleanup Activities, $27.5M); and Subsector 238 Specialty Trade Contractors, Size Standard $15M.

Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period with four 12-month option periods. Performance and payment bonds will be required per individual delivery order in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 28. <br /><br />Potential offerors are encouraged to monitor the FedBizOpps website for program documents.

Because the Government reserves the right to set this acquisition aside for small business, 8(a) firms, HUB Zone firms or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business based on the responses it receives, it is imperative that firms respond with the required information for capabilities to be accurately evaluated. Potential offerors should limit their responses to ten (10) pages (single spaced, 10 pt font).

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br />THIS IS A Sources Sought Notice ONLY. The MICC-West Point currently intends to award a contract for One (1) Structural Insulated Panel (SIP) building kit on an SOLE SOURCE basis, but is seeking vendors that may be able to perform this requirement in order to support a competitive procurement. Accordingly, the U.S. Government highly encourages all interested businesses (large and small) to respond to this sources sought synopsis. In addition, small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantage Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business concerns), must describe their identifying capabilities in meeting the requirements at a fair market price, i.e., information which may help support a set-aside.
<p>The proposed sole source Firm Fixed Price contract to The MURUS Co. for the following General Requirements: <br />Constructability<br />&bull; The SIP system must be designed for ease of assembly by soldiers having little familiarity with the system or design. Easy assembly is characterized by wall and roof panel connections that will align easily and require relatively few actions on the part of the assembler. Connection via a cam-lock system (engaged by turning a bolt using a T-wrench) is the preferred method.<br />&bull; The SIP solution provided must include all required 2x lumber factory cut and installed into the panel edges, foam sealant with dispensing guns, panel screws, and shop drawings. 2 x materials to be factory installed on wall panel bottoms, floor panel ends and edges, and roof panel edges. <br />&bull; The SIP system must be easily disassembled to enable repackaging and movement to another location.<br />The statutory authority for the sole source procurement is FAR 13-106-1(b)(1)(i), "Only one responsible source" based on the company being the sole developer and provider of the products and is therefore the only source capable of satisfying the Government requirements.</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ, IFB or RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this sources sought notice. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. However, if a competitive solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Governmentwide Point of Entry. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Governmentwide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The NAICS code is: 321992 with a Size Standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>In response to this sources sought, please provide:</p>
<p>1. Identify any condition or action that may be having the effect of unnecessarily restricting competition with respect to this acquisition and identify alternatives or solution solutions. Also contact the MICC Advocate for Competition, Dean Carsello, at dean.m.carsello.civ@mail.mil or 210-466-2419, if you believe that this action is unreasonably restricting competition. Include the subject of the acquisition, this announcement, and the MICC POC information from the Sources Sought Synopsis. Provide the specific aspects that unreasonably restrict competition and the rationale for such conclusion.</p>
<p>2. Name of the firm, point of contact, phone number, email address, DUNS number, CAGE code, identify business size (large business or a small business), and if applicable, a statement regarding small business status (including small business type(s)/certifications(s) such as SDB, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.) and the corresponding NAICS code.</p>
<p>3. Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for this requirement as a prime contractor or not. Identify subcontracting, joint ventures or teaming arrangement that will be pursued, if any.</p>
<p>4. Information in sufficient detail regarding previous experience (indicate whether as a prime contractor or subcontractor) on similar requirements (include size, scope, complexity, timeframe, government or commercial), pertinent certifications, etc., that will facilitate making a capability determination.</p>
<p>5. Information to help determine if the requirement (item or service) is commercially available, including pricing information, basis for the pricing information (e.g., market pricing, catalog pricing), delivery schedules, customary terms and conditions, warranties, etc.</p>
<p>6. Identify how the Army can best structure these contract requirements to facilitate competition, including competition among small business concerns.</p>
<p>7. Recommendations to improve the Army's approach/specifications/draft PWS/PRS to acquiring the identified items/services.</p>

This information is being sought for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposals (RFP), Request for Quotes (RFQ), or an indication the Government will contract for the items or services herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this Sources Sought Notice. Any response received will not be used as a proposal.<br /><br />No official solicitation currently exists in connection to this Sources Sought Notice. If in the future an official solicitation is released, there is no guarantee that sources responding to this Sources Sought Notice will be included on the source list.<br /><br />**NO QUESTIONS WILL BE ENTERTAINED. NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL BE HONORED.**<br /><br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires a Third Party Contractor to conduct inspections of tobacco retail establishments in Delaware and Ohio. The Government contemplates that two separate contracts will be written for the states of Delaware and Ohio. Under the provisions of the Tobacco Control Act (which amended the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act), FDA has been given the authority to regulate the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of tobacco products to protect the public health and to reduce tobacco use by minors. The Tobacco Control Act also amended the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 (CSTHEA) to grant FDA authority to regulate certain health warnings that must appear on smokeless tobacco products. The FDA requires a contractor to facilitate the enforcement provisions of the TCA by: (1) conducting inspections of retailers that sell and advertise regulated tobacco products; (2) collecting, documenting, and preserving evidence of inspections and investigations; and (3) supporting the FDA in judicial actions resulting from the inspections. <br /><br />ONLY SMALL BUSINESS FIRMS NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE WITH A CAPABILITY STATEMENT. A response to this Notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to NAICS 561611, and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. The capability statement must demonstrate the ability to employ qualified inspectors that are health, food, or drug officer/employees of any U.S. State, Territory, or political subdivision, in order to obtain the FDA Commission necessary to perform these tobacco retail inspections. The capability statement must also address the potential offeror's ability to obtain a grant of minor immunity if required by the state to perform undercover buy inspections and describe the Contractor's previous experience performing similar inspection work.
<p><br />Responses are requested by December 28, 2015 and are limited to a maximum of five (5) pages (font size 10 or larger). A copy of the company capability statement will also be accepted. The capability statement must provide sufficient detail for the FDA to determine whether the potential offeror can meet the requirements of the inspection services required. The anticipated period of performance is one year with two (2) one-year option periods. After review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and formal solicitation may be published on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Web site at https://www.fbo.gov/. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring the FBO website for the release of a pre-solicitation notice and solicitation.</p>
<p>Contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), accessed via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. All information provided will become property of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and will not be returned. Interested parties capable of performing this requirement should send an email responding to this Sources Sought Notice to Nicole Stevenson at nicole.stevenson@fda.hhs.gov.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined Sources Sought (SSN) and Small Businesses Sources Sought notice (SBSSN). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified business sources; (2) whether they are small business; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged business; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.
<p>The NAICS code for this project is 518210. The small business size standard is $32.5M.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Intramural Research Program (IRP) within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) consists of over 1,200 Principal Investigators and more than 4,000 Postdoctoral Fellows conducting basic, translational, and clinical research.   The scientific staff is part of over 20 Institutes and Centers (I/C), spread over multiple buildings and several NIH campus locations.  A majority of the I/Cs have Core facilities that are supported by Staff Scientists and Clinicians.  These Core Labs are available as shared resources for investigators affiliated with the I/C, but have limited visibility and availability for investigators from other I/Cs.  The IRP would like to develop a dedicated, searchable, web-based marketplace for research resources and services available through IRP's Core Facilities and through a majority of external research vendors, including academic Core Labs.  The platform should enable IRP investigators to query capabilities of multiple IRP Core Labs and external vendors through a secure communication channel to enable the best source selection in terms of technology, price and availability.</p>
<p>This notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of NIH.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The purpose of this support is to develop a web-based software platform to enable the 23 Institutes and Centers (I/C) of NIH Intramural Research Program to enhance both the visibility and sharing of research resources, technologies and expertise available through &gt;100 centralized Core Labs.  The platform should also include research services available through a majority of external vendors.  The ability to simultaneously query capabilities of internal and external vendors will allow IRP investigators to make side-by-side comparisons for the best source selection.  Direct comparisons with external vendors will also enable IRP Administrators and Core Labs to focus on providing new and emerging technologies rather than services available at a comparable or lower cost through external vendors.  The appropriate annotation of external vendors for certifications, accreditations and existing NIH contract or procurement vehicles, can also increase compliance with NIH and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), and streamline the procurement process for IRP investigators at the same time enabling the IRP to negotiate better pricing.</p>
<p><br />NIH is seeking capability statements from all eligible businesses concerns in performing the tasks/duties herein. Based on the responses received from this notice, the proposed project may be solicited as a Small Business Set-Aside. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NIH shall arise as a result of a response to this Small Business Sources Sought notice or the NIH's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:</p>
<p>The project requires the contractor to manage the following scope of work in support of an NIH IRP Research Marketplace: <br />&bull; Develop a web-based software that constitutes a Research Resources Marketplace, accessible only to NIH IRP researchers.<br />&bull; The Marketplace will include a searchable database of research technologies and services available through NIH IRP Core Labs and a majority of external research vendors, including Commercial Research Organizations (CROs) and academic Core Labs. It will also include a parallel web-interface that enables IRP Core Managers to easily update information on their lab's capabilities and respond to requests.<br />&bull; Platform should enable secure communication with multiple internal and external vendors simultaneously, including exchange of data files and price quotes. <br />&bull; Provide trained FTEs for coordinating requests from NIH investigators searching for specific services, and help NIH Core Managers update content as needed.</p>
<p><br />Specific tasks to be performed by the Contractor include the following:</p>
<p>1.	Development of a web database cataloging research services and technologies available through NIH IRP Core Labs and External Vendors. The database should be routinely updated to include the most innovative research services and capabilities available to biomedical researchers. <br />2.	 Database vendors should be annotated for their affiliation (NIH I/C) and specific certifications and accreditation (CLIA, PHS, etc.) to enhance compliance with NIH IRP regulations.  The database should also have the capability to annotate external vendors and services with information useful for sourcing of federal procurements (GSA, BPA, Small Business badging etc.). <br />3.	Capabilities of NIH IRP Core Labs and external vendors should be affiliated with relevant services and keywords in the platform, enabling users to easily identify multiple internal and external sources for the specific research service(s).   The list of vendors for each service should be customizable to ensure IRP Core labs and vendors with preferred status (e.g. small and minority owned-business) or with existing NIH contract vehicles are included.   <br />4.	System should include a secure communication channel that allows users to query capabilities of multiple internal and external vendors simultaneously, discuss project details, exchange files and obtain detailed quotes to enable a side-by-side comparison.  Users should be able to maintain all communications with vendors within the marketplace through a request management system, and receive email notifications only when the status of their request changes. <br />5.	Platform should allow investigators to Rate and Review vendor's performance, to enable the NIH IRP to benefit from their collective sourcing experiences.   <br />6.	Platform should have the capability to route user requests to designated NIH I/C-affiliated gatekeepers/approvers.  The I/C-affiliated gatekeepers and experts will ensure that I/C-preferred internal and external sources are included in requests initiated by their users.  The request routing workflow may be different across I/Cs and would need to be customized for the needs of each I/C. <br />7.	Platform should have a streamlined workflow or an easy to use web-interface that enables Managers to easily update information on existing Core Labs' capabilities and allows for addition of a new Core Lab.<br />8.	The web-platform should be a dedicated, "private" platform, accessible only to NIH IRP-affiliated investigators using the NIH Single Sign On (SSO) credentials. <br />9.	Web platform should have an Application Programming Interface (API) that can be used to link the Research Marketplace to desired NIH I/C systems (procurement system, Core Services Accessioning System, etc.).<br />10.	Provide trained FTEs to direct IRP users to the appropriate internal and external vendors.  In addition, trained Site Director(s) will support NIH IRP administrators and Core Managers to keep the content updated, and train investigators to use the platform. <br />11.	Track and collect data and provide on-demand reports on key marketplace events and platform adoption.</p>

<DESC><br />This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service, on a sole source basis with the University of Akron (UA), a non-profit entity, in accordance with the authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Using FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items procedures, the Government intends to negotiate a contract with UA for the continuation of the research.
<p>Forecasting a Continuum of Environmental Threats (FACETs) http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/facets/ is a project of the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) with the goal of helping the National Weather Service (NWS) replace its teletype&shy;era watch and warning system with a new approach that capitalizes on recent scientific and technological advances. At the heart of the change will be moving from binary (yes/no) watch and warning messages (you're either in a warning or you're not), to that in which probabilistic hazard information (PHI) is made available to end users at a resolution of every half mile and updated every two minutes. The FACETs project divides the high&shy;impact weather forecasting process (or continuum) into a sequence of seven, inter&shy;related components or "facets" that serve as an organizing framework for research and development. A key facet in this continuum is the prototype Probabilistic Hazard Information (PHI) Tool which allows forecasters to ingest next&shy;generation numerical model and statistical guidance, and add value to the guidance to produce actionable information.</p>
<p>This requirement is for a continuation of work begun by NSSL and Dr. Chen Ling, formerly with the University of Oklahoma, and builds upon prior research and outcomes. This collaborative effort began in 2014 with a Hazardous Weather Testbed (HWT) experiment designed for evaluating forecaster use of a web-based prototype tool for creating and issuing Probabilistic Hazard Information (PHI).</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may provide written notification to the Contract Specialist requesting a copy of the solicitation. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541990 Professional, Scientific and Technical Services and the small-business size standard is $15M of average annual receipts.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing via e-mail to the Contract Specialist, Mark Caban at mark.caban@noaa.gov.</p>

<p>Synopsis: Sources Sought</p>
<p>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is conducting market research for the purposes of identifying small businesses that have demonstrated capabilities to perform scientific support services which includes a vessel and crew capable of conducting and supporting environmental and biological data collection in the North Pacific Ocean including the Chukchi and Beaufort seas during summer months (August to early October).  No solicitation of offers is made by this synopsis.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) conducts scientific research on fish stocks, fish habitats and the chemistry of marine environments. Information from this research is widely used by commercial interests such as fishing industries, and governmental agencies involved in managing natural resources.  This research relies upon marine survey data on commercially marketable species such as rockfish, sablefish, and salmon, and on non-marketable and/or protected species such as eel grass, plankton, Steller sea lions, and harbor seals which is then turned into information products essential to fishing industries, state and federal regulators, and international treaty bodies.  AFSC marine research in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas has been conducted when funding is available.  One goal of the research is to assess the impact of loss of sea ice on the marine ecosystem in this region.  Data collected during the survey support the conservation and sustainable management of Living Marine Resources or the means by which to support ecosystem-based approaches to management. Vessel support in this region is critical to the AFSC mission.</p>
<p>Specific research objectives for the Arctic include that require vessel time:<br /> <br />1.	Quantify the distribution, abundance, and condition of demersal fishes and shellfishes throughout the US shelf waters of the Chukchi and western Beaufort Sea (Deploy/retrieve fishing nets).<br />2.	Quantify the distribution, abundance, and condition of pelagic marine fishes, in particular young-of-the year Arctic gadids and other forage fishes, throughout the US shelf waters of the Chukchi and western Beaufort Sea (Bureau of Ocean Energy Management).  Link observations with those derived from Lower Trophic Level (LTL) component (physics, primary, secondary production) to provide mechanistic understanding of trophic relationships (Deploy/retrieve fishing nets/midwater acoustics).<br />3.	Further resolve early life history characteristics of Arctic cod and saffron cod and their behavior and connectivity between the Chukchi Sea and western Beaufort Sea using new survey results and the continuous observations from moored echosounders (Deploy/retrieve moorings).  <br />4.	Quantify the distribution, abundance, and prey association (as a proxy for diet) of seabirds in the US shelf waters of the Chukchi and western Beaufort Sea (Bureau of Ocean Energy Management) in relation to oceanographic conditions and feeding guilds (Deploy/retrieve fishing nets/ zooplankton nets). <br />5.	Quantify the abundance of open water phytoplankton using Slocum gliders, a towed vehicle (both platforms measure T, S, O2, chlorophyll, and nitrate) and shipboard observations; make a quantitative comparison to sinking ice-associated algae (Deploy/retrieve conductivity, temperature at depth device and carrousel). <br />6.	Quantify the distribution, size, abundance, and species assemblage structure of zooplankton and ichthyoplankton throughout the US shelf waters of the Chukchi Sea relative to oceanographic conditions and compare results with historical estimates as derived from AFSC/FOCI sampling 2004-present and other available data.  Link observations to Upper Trophic Level (UTL) derived-data to provide mechanistic understanding of trophic relationships (Deploy/retrieve zooplankton gear).</p>

Statement of Work
Dual Chamber External Pacemaker replacement

"	Objectives 
The objective of this requirement is to purchase 9 dual chamber external pacemakers to replace the existing end of single and dual chamber pacemakers at the West Haven campus of VA Connecticut Healthcare system. 

"	Scope
Vendor shall work with Medical Center to implement the installation of:
o	9 Dual Chamber external pacemakers model 5392 with minimum of 1 year warranty
"	Capable of doing both single and dual chamber pacing
o	Delivery charges
o	Initial onsite clinical education on External pacemakers
o	Trade-in credit for existing 6 Medtronic single and 3 dual chamber external pacemakers


"	Schedule 
All service and/or installation is to be pre-scheduled (by vendor with agreement by customer) to have minimal impact on existing Medical Care functions. Ideally service can be conducted during the work day of 8am to 5pm.

During warranty period, vendor will provide all servicing repairs to restore the full use of the device, if there are any breakdowns in function.  All repairs are to be physically started within 12 hours of notification (or 8 business hours, whichever is shorter), and completed within 24 hours (or 8 business hours after start for repair).  Telephone support is to be available via a response within two hours of leaving a message with the vendor call center.

Service is to be requested and coordinated only through the designated Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR), so as to be assured that it is covered within the scope of the contract (work day 8-5 typical), and so that records are available for inspection by accrediting organizations.   Any services not coordinated by the COTR will not be considered completed, and will be considered to fail to meet the terms of the contract.


"	General
All persons servicing the device shall be able to provide proof of competency, as shown by training conducted on said system.  Proof shall be provided upon demand, and be immediately sent via fax, upon demand.  It is anticipated that any hospital regulatory inspections (JCAH, etc.) will have the vendor providing proof that they meet industry standards of quality, and traceable standards, as used to calibrate this device-system; at the time of the maintenance event.  Technicians servicing the system will be able to provide proof that they meet the standards of Information, and Background Security (investigation via the NACL process), and Hospital Environment Safety as required of all systems service in a Federal Government facility, or a regulated hospital environment.

"	Information Security Requirements - as mandated:
The contractor, their personnel, and their subcontractors shall be subject to the Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks regarding information and information system security as delineated in this contract.
GENERAL
Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.
ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS
a.	A contractor/subcontrator shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.
b.	All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
c.	Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service. Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.
d.	Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.
e.	The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.

INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE
a.	For information systems that are hosted, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities, contractors/subcontractors are fully responsible and accountable for ensuring compliance with all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and privacy directives and handbooks. This includes conducting compliant risk assessments, routine vulnerability scanning, system patching and change management procedures, and the completion of an acceptable contingency plan for each system. The contractor's security control procedures must be equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems. A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COTR and approved by VA Privacy Service prior to operational approval. All external Internet connections to VA's network involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation.
b.	Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA. These security controls are to be assessed and stated within the PIA and if these controls are determined not to be in place, or inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior to the collection of PII.
c.	Outsourcing (contractor facility, contractor equipment or contractor staff) of systems or network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires certification and accreditation (authorization) (C&A) of the contractor's systems in accordance with VA Handbook 6500.3, Certification and Accreditation and/or the VA OCS Certification Program Office. Government-owned (government facility or government equipment) contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require memorandums of understanding and interconnection agreements (MOU-ISA) which detail what data types are shared, who has access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems connected to VA networks.
d.	The contractor/subcontractor's system must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update the PIA. Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA contracting officer and the ISO for entry into VA's POA&M management process. The contractor/subcontractor must use VA's POA&M process to document planned remedial actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices, and the completion of those activities. Security deficiencies must be corrected within the timeframes approved by the government. Contractor/subcontractor procedures are subject to periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials, including the VA Office of Inspector General. The physical security aspects associated with contractor/subcontractor activities must also be subject to such assessments. If major changes to the system occur that may
affect the privacy or security of the data or the system, the C&A of the system may need to be reviewed, retested and re-authorized per VA Handbook 6500.3. This may require reviewing and updating all of the documentation (PIA, System Security Plan, Contingency Plan). The Certification Program Office can provide guidance on whether a new C&A would be necessary.
e.	The contractor/subcontractor must conduct an annual self assessment on all systems and outsourced services as required. Both hard copy and electronic copies of the assessment must be provided to the COTR. The government reserves the right to conduct such an assessment using government personnel or another contractor/subcontractor. The contractor/subcontractor must take appropriate and timely action (this can be specified in the contract) to correct or mitigate any weaknesses discovered during such testing, generally at no additional cost.
f.	VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or contractor/subcontractor-owned equipment or software on VA's network. If non-VA owned equipment must be used to fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, SOW or contract. All of the security controls required for government furnished equipment (GFE) must be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the equipment. All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV) software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VA- approved configuration. Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and patches. Owners of approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral software and the firewall on the non-VA owned OE.
g.	All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor/subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the contractors/subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract.
h.	Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are:
(1)	Vendor must accept the system without the drive;
(2)	VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or
(3)	VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.
(4) Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;
(a)	The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and
(b)	Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be pre- approved and described in the purchase order or contract.
(c)	A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.
SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION
a.	The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.
b.	To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's
notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.
c.	With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.
d.	In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other  Compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH
a.	Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.
b.	The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.
c.	Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:
(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
(2) Description of the event, including:
(a)	date of occurrence;
(b)	data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
(3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
(8)	Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
(9)	Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
(10)	Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
(11)	Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.
d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected
individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
(1)	Notification;
(2)	One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
(3)	Data breach analysis;
(4)	Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
(5)	One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
(6)	Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.
SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING
On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.

TRAINING
a. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:
(1)	Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;
(2)	Successfully complete the VA Cyber SecurityAwareness and Rules of Behavior training and annually complete required security training;
(3)	Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually complete required privacy training; and
(4)	Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document - e.g., any role-based information security training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements.]
b. The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COTR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required.
c. Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

<DESC>Equipment Lease:

This is a Sources Sought inquiry only.

The USGS requires instrumentation and personnel to collect high-resolution swath bathymetry mapping data for 23 days along the southeast Alaska continental shelf and slope in water depths between 100m and 2000m. The primary purpose of the work is to map and characterize the seafloor expression of the Queen Charlotte-Fairweather fault system to better constrain regional and transoceanic earthquake and tsunami hazards. The project requires continuous, high-quality coverage at approximately 10 m resolution, using a Reson SeaBat 7160 Survey System, a POS MV motion referencing unit, and expendable bathythermographs for sound velocity data. (See details below)

The contractor will provide two technicians, lead the mobilization and demobilization, provide and install a transducer pole mount, conduct an accurate patch test and system calibration, and perform all underway data acquisition and real-time QA/QC. All survey equipment will be provided and maintained throughout the survey in operational order by the contractor. 

The planned window of operations is May 1  June 25, 2016 and will take place on a contract vessel. The R/V Medeia (Alaska Department of Fish and Game) has been identified as appropriate and available. We are working towards securing the vessel through a cooperative agreement. A purchase request will be submitted as soon as funding is confirmed. 

Equipment and data Specifications

The final deliverables expected from the survey contractor are the following: 
1.	Reson SeaBat 7160 Survey System (minimum source frequency of 40 kHz)
2.	Pole mount for multibeam transducer/receiver compatible with contract vessel to be determined. Pole mount and motion referencing unit should be collocated
3.	POS MV motion referencing unit

<p>PURPOSE: The purpose of this event is to provide and discuss information regarding PM BEC's upcoming procurement of Department of Defense Automated Biometric Identification System (DoD ABIS) Sustainment Services and Service Life Extension.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT INFORMATION: This announcement is to exchange information with Industry. This event will not consist of one-on-one sessions. It will be a briefing with a question and answer period.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: This procurement is for a System Integrator to provide Operations and Maintenance support services, sustainment, enhancements and modifications of the existing DoD ABIS (version 1.2) as well as the creation of the DoD ABIS 1.3 baseline. The System Integrator Sustainment Services and Service Life Extension for DoD ABIS is across five major areas: Program Management, System Engineering, Logistics Management, Sustainment Services (System Operations and Maintenance), and Service Life Extension (System Development, Engineering, and Enhancement). The scope of this requirement includes the design, development, test, integration and maintenance of the hardware and software baseline pertaining to the following tasks, which are further defined in Section 3, Performance Requirements of the Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the Government will award a Cost Plus Incentive Fee with Cost Reimbursable (no fee) Task Order. The anticipated period of performance shall be twelve (12) month base period and four (4) twelve (12) month option periods.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT: PM BEC is responsible for executing the system life cycle management responsibilities for the Army enterprise biometrics solution for ingesting, storing, processing, matching, sharing and managing over 18,000,000 national biometrics records for adversary and neutral/unknown/non-aligned population groups across the full range of military operations. These capabilities are currently provided by DoD ABIS, which serves as the central, authoritative enterprise repository for biometrics data collected in the field from known and suspected terrorists, along with persons of interest to the Department of Defense. This acquisition establishes the requirements for a System Integrator to provide Operations and Maintenance support services, sustainment, integration of critical end-of-life upgrades, as well as enhancements and modifications of the existing DoD ABIS with an omnibus solution to acquire a wide range of system support and Information Technology services and solutions. The scope of this contract is to sustain the current operational baseline system (DoD ABIS 1.2), and to implement a Service Life Extension effort to address major component end-of-life issues resulting in a DoD ABIS 1.3 baseline. The DoD ABIS repository uses biometrics data to enable deployed forces to distinguish between adversaries and innocents and decide on the approach to respond based on scientific processing to support the military, homeland security missions and other assets across Department of Defense, Federal agencies, and international partners.</p>

There is no registration fee for attending this Industry Day Conference. Parking is available at the ASB public parking lot for a flat fee of $5.00.</span> <br /><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'"><br />PMS 415 has been tasked to develop an Anti-Torpedo Torpedo Defense System (ATTDS) with an anti-torpedo hard-kill capability for High Value Unit platforms (Carriers and Combat Logistics Force ships).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This capability will be developed through two associated but independent acquisition programs: the Torpedo Warning System (TWS) and the CAT, each with its own defined mission. The TWS will serve as a standalone detection, alert, and tactical control system which will provide the detection, localization, and classification capabilities necessary for the ship to evade, decoy, or defeat the torpedo threat using existing or future tactics and countermeasures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The CAT will be developed separately as a hard-kill countermeasure. The CAT will continue development as a common countermeasure for all platforms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /></span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'"><br />The CAT consists of the Anti-Torpedo Torpedo (ATT) and the All-Up Round Equipment (AURE).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ATT is a small-diameter, quick-reaction hard-kill torpedo countermeasure used to disable incoming threat torpedoes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ATT will search, home, terminal home, and fuse on its target using technology developed under sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It consists of the following five (5) major sections: Nose, Warhead, Command &amp; Control, Power-plant and Tail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ATT is housed in an AURE, which consists of a thin-walled composite canister, electrical cabling to enable communication between the ATT and fire control, and energetics for launching the ATT and the ATT canister.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'"><br />The resultant capabilities of the ATTDS family of systems will be integrated into an open architecture designed system leading to the demonstration of an anti-torpedo detection and track for TWS and hard-kill engagement for CAT<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'"><br />The main focus of the ATT Industry Day Conference is to brief participants on the ATT Technical Data Package (TDP). There will also be related topics including, but not limited to: a general technical overview on the All-Up Round Equipment (AURE) and high level CAT/ATTDS requirements. All information presented at the ATT Industry Day Conference is for informational purposes only.</span> <br /><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi"><br />In order to view the UNCLASSIFIED ATT TDP the Government has established an electronic share-site to serve as the repository for unclassified technical information related to the</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi"> Anti-Torpedo Torpedo (ATT), part of the Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT) system<span style="COLOR: black">.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to increase the ceiling of Contract N66001-15-C-4020 to HRL Laboratories LLC, awarded by Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SSC) Pacific on behalf of the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency Defense Sciences Office (DARPA/DSO) on 16 June 2014 for a performance period of nine (9) months as a result of Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 14-46 Graph Theoretical Research in Algorithm Performance and Hardware for Social Networks (GRAPHS).  The effort under the contract includes development of a novel framework using network theory to model the dynamics of the electric power grid to determine power grid sensitivity to expected power demand and utilization using real-time data. The effort will fuse data from various networks relevant to power flow, such as transmission and distribution networks, with the massive amount of social media data available for sensing energy-related human behavior. This new framework could be used to develop control protocols which can be implemented on a smart grid to dramatically reduce the risk of large-scale blackouts that affect millions of people with tremendous direct and indirect costs.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541712.  Due to the nature of Research and Development efforts, DARPA could not have reasonably estimated the results of the research from this program, which resulted in finding a link between a measure of network topology and cascading failures.  Importantly, it was found that this relationship holds across multiple different models with different dynamics; so the result does not depend on the details of the simulated physics.  Consequently, this effort will greatly benefit from additional research in the prediction statistic of and the prevention of large-scale cascading failures under this current contract.  This action includes a ceiling increase of approximately $494,854.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes and will be posted for fifteen (15) days.  A determination by the Government not to compete based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Interested parties may submit comments in writing to the Contracts Specialist, Jeannette L. Perez (Code 22530) SSC Pacific who may be reached by telephone at (619) 553-7918 or via email at Jeannette.perez1@navy.mil .

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers New York District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 million) construction project:
<p>Replacement of the West Point Elementary School, West Point, NY</p>
<p>Project Description:<br />The New York District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (District) is preparing plans and specifications for the construction of a 95,000 SF, two story elementary school at West Point, NY that will serve approximately 500 children from Pre-K to 4th Grade. The elementary school will be a multi-story building with drilled pier, shallow spread footing, or other appropriate foundation, structural steel frame or other superstructure that supports a clear span reconfigurable facility, reinforced masonry or reinforced concrete and/or metal stud curtain wall with brick or other durable veneer metal, and a combination of curtain wall/punched window glazing systems. Interior construction will consist of some combination of masonry and gypsum wall systems, and operable/movable partition walls. Interior spaces include learning neighborhoods, studios, learning hubs, staff collaboration areas, computing center, art room, music suite, occupational therapy/ physical therapy (OT/PT), a commons area, multi-purpose space, information center, food service, administrative offices, guidance counseling center, a special education office, health services area, maintenance support, central storage area, technology service center, a tie-in to an existing gymnasium (Building 705C), and other required areas for a fully functioning elementary school. The project includes site improvements such as removing large quantities of rock, heavy grading, signage, fencing, paving, landscaping, covered walkways, exterior lighting, utilities, and playground area. Cafeteria, food service and information center areas were sized for the future elementary school population.<br />The project includes related infrastructure such as gas, water, sewer, electrical, staff and visitor parking areas, student drop off lane, mechanical rooms, emergency access lanes, bus loading/unloading areas, and delivery areas. The project will require demolition of 3 buildings for a total of approximately 63,749 SF.<br />The project involved multiple phases because the existing elementary school must remain operational while the new elementary school is constructed. A temporary parking solution is required while the existing school, parking, and existing bus loop are being demolished to clear footprint for new parking and student drop-off areas that meet AT/FP requirements.<br />Sustainable principles will be maximized in the design, development and construction of the project in accordance with Executive Order 13123 and other applicable laws and executive orders. Energy conservation and environmentally safe measures will be incorporated in this project wherever feasible, practical or required by regulation. Energy and natural resource conservation measures will be maximized in the design to the extent possible. In accordance with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) for Schools, Silver certification is required.<br />Facilities will be designed in accordance with DoDEA Education Facilities Specifications, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibility Guidelines/Architectural Barriers Act (ABA), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Life Safety Code, Standards of Seismic Safety for Federally Owned Buildings, and energy and water conservation standards. The estimated air conditioning load is 300 Tons<br />Range of Magnitude: Between $25,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Approximately 720 calendar days after Notice to Proceed. Notice to Proceed is anticipated to occur between August 2016 and September 2016.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are:</p>
<p>a. The project will require multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.</p>
<p>b. There is a shortage of skilled labor in the region.</p>
<p>c. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.</p>
<p>d. PLA's have been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in this geographic area.</p>
<p>e. A PLA will promote the agency's long term program interests, such as training of skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs.</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:</p>
<p><br />1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>2. Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Have comparable projects been undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on similar projects? If so, please provide supporting documentation? For each project, please indicate if a PLA was used, if available, the initial and final cost, number of trades on the project, if the project was completed on time, and if there were any challenges such as labor shortages, labor related delays, safety issues, etc</p>
<p>2. Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project? This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area over $25M, within 50 miles of West Point, NY which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Are existing apprentice programs providing sufficient numbers of skilled workers for future requirements? If so please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>3. Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would impact the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible. Is the proposed schedule/completion time one which would benefit from a PLA - if so, how? Will a PLA impact the completion time? How would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>4. Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement. Are there any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA?</p>
<p>5. Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement. <br /><br />6.

<p>AFFARS 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman (NOV 2012)</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the ombudsman, Col. Todd M. Copeland, AFTC/CV, 1 South Rosamond Blvd, Edwards AFB, CA 93524-3784, phone number (661) 277-2810, facsimile number (661) 277-7593.

Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Bathing System No Rinse. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Bathing System No Rinse products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Bathing System No Rinse products. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant County End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Bathing System No Rinse will be established approximately May 2016 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately June 2016 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Bathing System No Rinse products. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Bathing System No Rinse.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Bathing System No Rinse. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $420,661.00. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Five product groupings are required for addition to the QSL and account for ($347,157.00) of the total volume in sales ($420,661.00). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) or Central Daylight Time (CDT) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><br />C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Chemical Sterilization Indicators. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Chemical Sterilization Indicators (hereafter referred to as Sterilization Indicators) products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Sterilization Indicators. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant County End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Sterilization Indicators will be established approximately May 2016 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately June 2016 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Sterilization Indicators. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Sterilization Indicators.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Sterilization Indicators. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $1,426,665. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Six items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 100.00% of the total volume in sales $1,426,665. The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><br />C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br /></span>The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification.

FAR PROVISIONS
20. 52.204-16	Commercial and Government Entity Code Reporting (NOV 2014)
21. 52.204-17	Ownership or Control of Offeror
22. 52.209-5	Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)
(a)
(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --
(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and
(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and
(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(2) Examples.
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.
(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.
23. 52.209-7	Information Regarding Responsibility Matters (Jul 2013)
(a) Definitions. As used in this provision-
"Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings). This includes administrative proceeding at the Federal and State level but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or grant. It does not include agency actions such as contract audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of deliverables.
"Federal contracts and grants with total value greater than $10,000,000" means-
(1) The total value of all current, active contracts and grants, including all priced options; and
(2) The total value of all current, active orders including all priced options under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity, 8(a), or requirements contracts (including task and delivery and multiple-award Schedules).

<CONTACT>Matthew White 831-392-7335
<DESC>NPS researchers have been developing the Agile Close Quarters Underwater Autonomous System (ACQUAS), using the SeaBotix vLBV300 as a development platform. The fully autonomous ACQUAS is used to investigate a variety of close-quarters operations, including diver support and operations very close to the seafloor. Accurate localization and navigation is required to facilitate these operations. ACQUAS has been outfitted with a navigation system consisting of an Inertial Navigation System (INS), Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), and sonar. A computer API has been developed for the system. A new INS is required to augment the existing system and to develop additional platforms in order to investigate multi-vehicle operations and underwater collaboration.
 A key requirement is that the new sensor must be compatible with the existing system and be amendable to close-quarters operations.

<p><br />ix) 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items (Oct 2014)<br />The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items<br />(a) The USCG intends to evaluate quotations and award a single purchase order without discussions. Therefore, each initial quotation shall contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. The USCG reserves the right to conduct discussions, if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer. The USCG may reject any or all quotations if such action is in the public interest. Finally, the USCG may waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotations.</p>
<p>The evaluation factors and sub-factors are listed in descending order of importance. Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The degree of importance associated with price will increase commensurably with the degree of equality among different offerors' technical and past performance quotations.</p>
<p>(1) Technical Capability<br />(2) Past Performance<br />(3) Cost/Price</p>
<p>Technical: <br />Offerors shall provide a narrative that exhibits its knowledge, ability, and method of providing all the requirements in the SOW in regards to number of rooms, capacity, and equipment. <br />** A site visit will be conducted to determine technical acceptance <br />The Government shall evaluate the offeror's quote against these requirements to determine whether the proposal is acceptable or unacceptable, using the ratings and descriptions outlined in Table below.<br />Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable The offer clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable The offer does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Past Performance:<br />Per FAR 13.106-2(a)(3)(c), the USCG will primarily evaluate offeror's past performance by using the Governmentwide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The USCG will examine an offeror's recent and relevant history of past performance to assess the degree of risk the offeror may present during order performance.<br />"Recent" means that per FAR 42.1503(g), USCG will evaluate past performance information in PPIRS that is within the previous three years of the anticipated start of the period of performance (i.e., 28 September 2012 to 28 September 2015).<br />"Relevant" means that USCG will evaluate recent past performance information that is similar in size, scope, and complexity to the present SOW.<br />Past performance shall be used as an evaluation factor within the LPTA process. Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis using the ratings in Table below.<br />Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Unacceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>

Offerors must provide complete pricing items to be procured in Attachment ___1_____<br />A zero dollar rate (tiny_mce_marker.00) or a rate left blank will be interpreted by USCG to mean that the offeror will provide the required service as not separately priced.</p>
<p>Technical and past performances, when combined, are more important than price. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

<p>&bull; All proposals submitted shall provide the name, phone number, and email address of their primary Point of Contact for this order, and their Cage and DUNs codes.</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors may submit multiple proposals per expertise listed in the PWS or as one collective proposal.</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors shall submit pricing as hourly labor rates for the labor category of Operational Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Support and Technical Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) Support. Travel and ODC pricing data is not required for submission.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Offeror shall include a description of the expertise they can provide and their plan to ensure a rapid response to a given task order.</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors shall detail the expertise they are able to provide for both the Operational and Technical Support.</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors shall describe their ability to recruit and retain talent needed for the expertise described in the Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors shall separate pricing data, technical and past performance data into three separate PDF files.</p>
<p>&bull; Offerors shall ensure this information is updated and accurate within the System for Award Management (SAM) website (www.sam.gov) to ensure they are registered to the appropriate NAICS Code.</p>
<p>Offerors may propose to one or all required skill sets outlined in the Performance Work Statement. Not proposing to a specific skill set will not exclude an offeror from evaluation and potential award.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to hold discussions, but reserves the right to do so. In the event of discussions, the offerors within the competitive range will be notified.</p>
<p>(ix) EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS: The provision of FAR clause 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items applies to this solicitation. The Evaluation of Proposals for this Solicitation will be as follows:</p>
<p>Evaluation of Proposals:</p>
<p>Offerors who do not meet the required instructions in paragraph viii, listed above, will be listed as unresponsive in the evaluation.</p>
<p>The award will be made based upon the best overall (i.e., Best Value) proposal(s) that are determined to be the most beneficial to the Government using Tradeoff procedures, with appropriate considerations given to the three published evaluation factors: Combined Technical / Risk Rating, Past Performance Rating, and Price Rating. Best value means the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. Subjective judgment against objective criteria is implicit in the evaluation process.<br />The Government intends to award multiple IDIQ contracts to meet the requirement, but reserves the right to award a single award should a single offeror present themselves to be able to meet the requirements.</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned that award may be made to other than the lowest-priced proposal(s) if the Government determines that paying a price premium is warranted due to the evaluation of non-price factors. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated proposal(s), if the Government determines that paying a price premium is not warranted. As proposal ratings tend toward equality, Cost/Price will become a more determinative factor. <br />The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract(s) without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.3, as applicable, if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br />Offerors may be given a chance to clarify aspects of their proposal that require clarifications. However, with clarifications, offerors are not given an opportunity to respond to alter, change, or revise their proposals. <br />Relative Importance of Evaluation Factors:<br />The Combined Technical/Risk Rating is the most important factor. The Combined Technical / Risk Ratings and Past Performance Ratings, when combined, are significantly more important than Price, which will be evaluated, but not assigned an adjectival rating (defined below).</p>
<p>COMBINED TECHNICAL/RISK RATINGS:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate how the proposal items meet the PWS requirements on a range scaling from Unacceptable, Marginally Acceptable, Acceptable, Good, and Outstanding. The definitions are as follows:</p>
<p>Unacceptable: Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is unawardable.<br />Marginal: Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is high.<br />Acceptable: Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate.</p>
<p>Good: Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low.</p>
<p>Outstanding: Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low.</p>
<p>Past Performance:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate relevant past performance in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.3, as applicable, to ensure there has been no recent (within the past three years) negative past performance. The Government will rate Past Performance to determine relevance and confidence.</p>
<p>Relevant Levels are defined as:</p>
<p>Not Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Somewhat Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.<br />Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Very Relevant: Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Confidence Levels are defined as:</p>
<p>Unknown Confidence (Neutral): No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br />No Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br />Limited Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Substantial Confidence: Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Cost/Price:</p>
<p>Cost/Price evaluations will be based on the rates submitted in the attached Labor Rate sheet. These will be compared using the three year base period for Base Rates and one year option for the Option Rates. Each year will be measured with 2080 hours per year. The combined 3 base years and 1 option year will establish the Total Evaluated Price (TEP) in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.404-1. The Total Evaluated Price (TEP) will be the sum of the completed Labor CLINs, to include option(s). The TEP will be used in the Government's cost-technical tradeoff to select the Awardee(s) for this contract. This analysis will be used to determine the Best Value for the Government and its mission. Evaluation of option(s) shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>Travel and ODCs are not included in the cost/price analysis.</p>
<p>(x) OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATION: The provision of FAR clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items applies to this solicitation.</p>
<p>Offerors will need to ensure this information is updated and accurate within the System for Award Management (SAM) website (www.sam.gov) by the closing of this RFP.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>Background and Description: <br /><br />The DSO, which is a part of the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), is a recognized center of excellence for DoD spectrum matters. One of DSO's missions is to provide spectrum and Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) engineering and analysis support services on a reimbursable, customer-funded basis to DoD Components, federal agencies, non-federal government organizations, and to foreign entities when authorized by the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO), the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), or the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. <br /><br />Engineering support related to spectrum operations are an integral part of the overall information battlespace. In future operational environments it is essential that electromagnetic systems perform as expected to help achieve mission objectives. The challenges faced in meeting our objectives include:<br /><br />&bull; Rapidly changing technologies associated with spectrum systems<br />&bull; Competing demands for spectrum access<br />&bull; Adversaries utilizing advanced technologies<br />&bull; Coordinating and collaborating with all pertinent stakeholders (e.g., services, intelligence community, commercial, academia)<br />&bull; Providing timely and accurate information for decision makers at the appropriate level<br />&bull; Working efficiently across multiple mission areas and organizations<br />A thorough understanding of the physics and technologies related to spectrum-dependent systems and how tactical operations are affected, is essential in supporting this effort. This would include:<br />&bull; Spectrum related technologies (e.g., electromagnetic propagation, non-linear effects, antennas, near field conditions, Electromagnetic Pulse, etc.) across the electromagnetic spectrum<br />&bull; System performance considerations (e.g., digital signal processing, Software Defined Radios, encryption technologies, system vulnerabilities, etc.)<br />&bull; Software tools (e.g., engineering, scenario) applications and limitations<br />&bull; Testing and measurement tools and processes and limitations<br />&bull; The integrated operational, technical, and policy (e.g., regulations generated by the World Radiocommunications Conference) aspects of the EMS Applied Engineering Support tasking<br /><br />To achieve the objectives of this requirement, it is imperative that the contractor takes an integrated approach, considering the DSO and its customer base and technical, operational, policy, and acquisition factors, and working with close communications with all stakeholders to ensure requirements and expectations are met. This includes:<br /><br />&bull; Promoting and leveraging a multi-disciplinary, highly-skilled workforce with technical, analytic, and operational expertise<br />&bull; Encouraging collaboration to strengthen partnerships across diverse domains<br />&bull; Aligning business processes, management practices, and tools to best serve the broader community<br />&bull; Applying consistent and repeatable quality management practices (e.g., ISO 9001) to ensure that requested products and services are value-added and delivered within cost and schedule. Management of elements include:<br />&bull; Planning<br />&bull; Execution<br />&bull; Communications <br />&bull; Monitoring (e.g., periodic reviews, testing)<br />&bull; Adjustments<br />&bull; Delivery and acceptance criteria<br /><br />This contract will provide technical support to DSO for the following tasks:<br /><br />a. E3 and Spectrum Engineering - analyzing equipment and systems for potential E3 problems and recommending solutions.<br /><br />Contract Type: The Government contemplates award of a single-award indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm fixed-price and cost type CLINs contract resulting from this solicitation.<br /><br />Competition: This solicitation is a Total Small Business Set aside.<br /><br />The requisite NAICS code for the acquisition is 541330.

Question:
We would like to know if the customer has salients for the instrument set for the osteochondral grafts for this solicitation?

Answer:
There are no salient characteristics for the instrument set.  However, the following is a more specific description of what the set is used for and what it contains.  The set is to be used for fresh osteochondral graft implantation.  The set includes a graft station, graft makers, lesion reamers, forceps, tamps, and dilators.  The set must contain instrumentation used for the donor site (allograft tissue) and the recipient site (patient).  The instruments must cover lesions measuring 15-35 mm in diameter.  The set must contain at least 5-7 different diameter reamers within the range of 15-135 mm.  The set accompanies the fresh allograft to KACH so that it can be inspected and processed prior to surgery.
  
Question:
In the various graft tissue types requested, can you provide any additional information or specifics for the "deformity correction allografts" in line item "d"?

Answer:  
Since the type of surgery performed is sports medicine surgery, the deformity grafts referred to above are HIGH TIBIAL OSTEOTOMY ALLOGRAFT WEDGES (used for high tibial osteotomies and distal femoral osteotomies).  Sizes must include:  6mm, 8mm, 10mm, 12mm 14mm, 16mm, 18mm.

In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p>Amendment to RFQ.&nbsp; Below are Questions and Answers, please see attachment for changes made to the RFQ.<br /><br />QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br />M67001-16-Q-0016 POV Storage<br />Questions and Answers</p>
<p>Question: Who is the current contractor or past, and how much was the award amount?<br />Answer: The incumbent is Semper Fi Storage contract M67001-11-D-0002 and the estimated award amount was $2,316,500.</p>
<p>Question: Is there a contract (location) in place currently for this service? If so, can we view their facility?<br />Answer: The incumbent is Semper Fi Storage. It would be to their discretion if they will permit you to visit their location. As this is their facility and not Government owned.</p>
<p>Question: Is there a minimum guarantee vehicle count? If only a few vehicles are stored it is not cost effective. Or is there a monthly maintenance line item to cover the base facility cost?<br />Answer: The Government will not guarantee a monthly minimum of vehicles stored at any given time. Maintenance should be included in the monthly cost for storage.</p>
<p>Question: Is there a location at Camp Lejeune that may be leased for this use?<br />Answer: No. There is currently no location aboard MCB Camp Lejeune, nor satellites that may be leased for these services.</p>
<p>Question: Please expand on the options on the 1001-1004, 2001-2004, 3001-3004 &amp; 4001-4004 respectively. Are these for additional years?<br />Answer: Yes. The requirement includes four (4) 12-month options. It is to the Government's discretion to exercise the optional years. Proper notification will be provided on the Government's intent in accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-9. The CLINs for optional years are to be priced and evaluated in accordance with FAR Clause 52.217-5.</p>
<p>Question: Reference C5.1.3 The Contractor shall provide "secured storage" for each vehicle. "Secured Storage" is defined in C2.15 as: "Secured Storage. A place where an item(s) is kept from risk of theft, damage or loss. Includes requirement for 8 foot high (as a minimum) security fenced, lighted location with sufficient light to visually detect intrusion, 24 hour surveillance monitoring and recording, with a gravel or asphalt elevated storage area to prevent damage due to minor flooding." Does the facility have to be enclosed or covered structurally?<br />Answer: The facility in which vehicles are to be physically stored is to be fenced in accordance with C5.1.3 to include at a minimum 8 foot high security fence. The facility as a whole does not require fencing, only the location for which the vehicles will be stored. The facility which the vehicles are stored does not require coverage.</p>
<p>Question: E1.2.1 INVOICE states: "The preliminary invoice shall be submitted simultaneously with the monthly report and be based on information provided on the report (See Section C, paragraph C5.7). Should the correct reference be "C5.8.1 Reporting Requirements?"<br />Answer: Yes that is correct. Amendment will be done to correct this error to reference the correct section, C5.8.1 Reporting Requirements.</p>
<p>Question: DD Form 788/788-1: The solicitation repetitively references and directs use of DD Form 788/788-1. What is included in the definition of Privately Owned Vehicle? Does it include recreational vehicles, boats, watercraft, camper and motorcycles?<br />Answer: Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) is a car, sport utility vehicle (SUV) or non-commercial truck. The Contractor is not permitted, nor required, to store recreational vehicles, boats, watercraft, camper or motorcycles under the terms of this contract.</p>
<p>Question: Volume: How many vehicles are currently stored? What is the maximum and minimum number stored over the last three years?<br />Answer: The volume of vehicle storage varies significantly. The minimum was 1 with a maximum of 1,200.</p>
<p>Question: What has been the government expenditure against the current contract each of the past three years?<br />Answer: The estimated volume of stored vehicles over the past three years is 22,000 vehicles.</p>
<p>Question: Can service member retrieve and return their vehicles if they come home on leave (mid-tour/R&amp;R)?<br />Answer: No. Once the POV is checked in it will not be retrieved until proper notification is provided by DMO in accordance with C5.5 Release of Stored Vehicles.</p>
<p>Question: How many vehicles can a single service member store?<br />Answer: One (1).</p>
<p>Question: Reference C5.1.1 (4) reads: "(4) Minimum two (2) guards 24 hours, 7 days a week." During normal operating hours there will be multiple service and maintenance staff on location; does the requirement remain for 2 additional security guards? Or does the two security guard requirement apply outside of normal operating hours?<br />Answer: Yes, the two security guard requirement is for outside of normal operating hours. The intent is to have personnel available to monitor the security surveillance of the vehicles.</p>
<p>Question: Service members are supposed to retrieve their vehicles within 48 hours of return to home station. How long after members return to station are vehicles to be considered as unclaimed? What is the procedure for dealing with unclaimed vehicles?<br />Answer: Past administration of these services there have been no reports of unclaimed vehicles. DMO maintains the responsibility to ensure the pick-up or transfer of vehicles notified for release. The Contractor shall not be responsible for unclaimed vehicles.</p>
<p>Question: Will Representations and Certifications be required even if they are current as posted in SAM?<br />Answer: In accordance with provision FAR 52.212-3 completion of the Representations and Certifications within this solicitation are only required if the current SAM registration is not accurately reflective of the vendor's current status. If the vendor's SAM account is current completion of the Representations and Certifications contained within this solicitation are not required and are incorporated by reference in accordance with provision FAR 52.204-19.</p>
<p>Question: Is there a page limitation on the Technical Proposal and/or Past Performance submissions?<br />Answer: No. There is no page limit on the submission of the quotation for these services.</p>
<p>Question: In reference to E.1.2.1 INVOICE. Monthly delivery/task order will be issued at the beginning of each month for a quantity of 700 vehicles. Does this statement in the solicitation refer to actual number of cars expected to be stored monthly?<br />Answer: No. This is an error. An amendment will be done as the Contractor shall bill for the number currently in storage. Reference to "monthly" deliver/task order is not reflective of the issuance of deliver/task orders. Delivery/task orders will be issued quarterly with an estimated quantity. The Contractor will bill monthly for exact number of vehicles stored.</p>
<p>Question: Is the contractor required to provide transportation of troops for car drop off or car pick up from the Solver facility?<br />Answer: No. The military member is responsible for transport after dropping off their POV.</p>

<CONTACT>Jackson, Edward
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Lower Colorado Region, has a requirement for spot surface preparation and painting of damaged surface areas on the interior of the Upper Nevada Laterals.  The work is located at Hoover Dam, on the Colorado River, approximately 7 miles northeast of Boulder City, Nevada, and 32 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada, in Clark County, Nevada and Mohave County, Arizona.  This work is specifically on the Nevada side of Hoover Dam.

This work is not for full repair of the penstock coatings.  It is for limited repair of the areas of the interior portion that are damaged.  The principal components of repairing each penstock are anticipated to include the following: 

(1) Furnishing, erecting and relocation scaffolding system for the internal 13-foot diameter penstock laterals. The upper penstock 13-foot diameter laterals slope at an angle of 45 degrees.  Each lateral is nearly 275 feet long. (Laterals are simply the smaller pipes that branch off the 30-foot pipes to feed the hydro generators.); 

(2) Coating removal, surface preparation, and coating of damaged areas in the interior 13-foot diameter penstocks sections; and 

(3) Control of leakage water, estimated to be approximately 200-500 gallons per minute (GPM) within the penstock, may be necessary.  The water can be plumbed directly through the drains of the penstock, and from there, the Government will pump the water into the river.  Care must be taken to isolate this water from any work that may contaminate this water.

This solicitation is Unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 238320 Painting and Wall Covering Contractors, which has a small business size standard of $15M.  This acquisition will be pursued in accordance with FAR Part 15 and in accordance with the source selection evaluation criteria included in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Award will be made using best-value, source-selection procedures incorporating tradeoffs between price and non-price factors.  It is expected that the RFP will include evaluation factors for Relevant Experience, Technical Capability, Past Performance and Price.  The Government intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract as a result of this solicitation.  Award is expected by January 2016.  The estimated price range is between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00.  

Offerors are required to have a current registration on the System for Award Management (SAM) to be eligible for contract award.  Offerors may register on SAM at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/

A pre-proposal site visit will be scheduled for all interested parties.  Site visit information (e.g. date, time, location) will be provided with the solicitation.

It is anticipated that the solicitation, in the form of an RFP, will be issued on or about November 19, 2015.  No documents will be available until the solicitation is issued. The solicitation will only be issued electronically via www.FBO.gov. Offerors should register on FBO to be included on the offeror list in order to receive notifications pertaining to the solicitation or visit the FBO website after issuance to download the solicitation and any subsequent amendments. All parties are responsible for checking the FBO website to ensure that they have the most current information.  All dates in this announcement are estimates and are subject to change.  The solicitation, once issued, will contain instructions for submitting questions.

DESCRIPTION

The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, Title X Part III (Public Law 111-11) signed on March 30, 2009, provided the authorization to construct this important project as a major component of the Navajo Nation San Juan River Basin Water Rights Settlement in New Mexico. 

An RFI (R15PS01052) was announced on May 22, 2015 which requested the following information.

1.	Questions for Design-Build Teams:
a.	Does your company have the capacity to permit, design, and build the CLWTP considering the information provided in this RFI and assuming there are no significant deviations from this information once more data is provided?
b.	Company point of contact, address, telephone number, and status of the company; (i.e., small business, HUBZone business, etc.)
c.	Provide your companys portfolio as it relates to:
1.	Design-build in general.
2.	Specific application to water treatment facilities.
3.	Similar size/type of WTP needed for this project that you have designed and/or built.
4.	Highlight any innovative treatment (design or construction) techniques you have used to reduce cost and/or maintenance time.
d.	Describe your companys experience in designing water treatment plants for natural organic matter reduction, including but not limited to biofiltration and other treatment processes.
e.	Describe companys experience with water treatment operation under a design-build-operate scenario.
2.	Questions for Equipment Manufacturers, Representatives and Process Engineers:
a.	Suggested treatment processes with pertinent technical data sufficient to support manufacturers representations, operational requirements, costs (initial installation and operational), warranties and proprietary information.
b.	Market standard sizes, lay-outs, plans and specifications, space and power requirements, typical and maximum/minimum feed rates, typical replacement or service time requirements, and typical life cycle costs per 1,000 gallons for a water treatment plant of this size/capacity.
c.	Company information, such as socio economic status, size, market share, annual sales, length of time in business, length of time with this specific product.
d.	List of projects using this treatment process.

DESIGN DATA

A.  The CLWTP will serve the Eastern portion of the NGWSP and will consist of a water treatment plant (WTP) and pumping plant.  The Cutter Lateral obtains water from Cutter Reservoir, an existing regulating reservoir on the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project.  

B.  Hydraulic Data
1.	WTP
The WTP will be designed and built for the 2020 demand with the capability of being expanded for the 2040 demand (Table 1).  The influent /effluent difference assumes an approximate 4% required maximum loss through the WTP.

Table 1:  Year 2020 and 2040 water demands
Units	Demand	2020	2040
		Influent	Effluent	Influent	Effluent
MGD	Maximum Day	4.0	3.8	5.6	5.4
	Average Day	3.1	3.0	4.3	4.2
	Minimum Month	2.5	2.4	3.5	3.3

2.	Pumping Plant
Pumping Plant shall be designed for sufficient head (420 feet) to pump water to proposed operating storage tank elevations at the following flow rates (Table 2):


Table 2:  Year 2020 and 2040 pumping plant flow rates
Year	Units
	(CFS)	(GPM)
2020	5.9	2,700
2040	8.3	3,800





C.  Water Quality Data
1.	Raw Water Quality
The source water is a reservoir with a good water quality.  See the 4/6/2015 water sample highlighted water quality results (Table 3).

Table 3:  Highlighted water quality results (4/6/2015 sample)

	Analyte	Value	Units
General	Alkalinity (Total)	81	mg/L
	DOC	2.5	mg/L
	Hardness	101	mg/L as CaCO3
	pH	8.1	
	TDS	160	mg/L
	TOC	2.6	mg/L
	TSS	4.5	mg/L
	Turbidity	4.5	NTU
	UV	0.079	cm-1
Ions	Arsenic	0.001	mg/L
	Bromide	<0.2	mg/L
	Chloride	<10	mg/L
	Iron	0.14	mg/L
	Manganese	0.002	mg/L
	Sodium	15	mg/L
	Sulfate	45	mg/L

2.	Finished Water Quality
a.	Finished water must meet all USEPA primary and secondary drinking water standards.  
b.	The primary finished water quality parameter of concern is natural organic matter and the resulting disinfection byproduct formation.  This is due to the long distribution system length.  
c.	The finished water DOC concentration will need to be approximately 0.5 mg/L.

D.  Treatment Constraints 
1.	96% overall WTP water recovery
2.	Use of chloramines is not permitted

<DESC>AMENDMENT 2

Attached are the FAA responses to industry comments.  Please submit any additional comments by December 15, 2015.


AMENDMENT 1

Draft SIR section H is amended.  Please refer to Amendment 0001 file for details.

INTRODUCTION/PURPOSES

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airport Cable Loop (ACL) program is responsible for the sustainment of current telecommunication infrastructure and replacement of obsolete telecommunication infrastructure at airports throughout the National Airspace System (NAS). Fiber optic equipment and cabling is used to interface voice and data connections between various on-airport facilities. Based on new requirements made available as part of this request  see updated Product Description (PD) in Attachment 7   the FAAs purpose of this Market Survey and Request for Information (RFI)/Draft Screening Information Request (SIR) is to:

(1)	Conduct a Market Survey by obtaining answers to several questions regarding commercially available Multi-Service Platform (MSP) equipment. The FAA intends to use this Market Survey to refine the MSP acquisition and deployment planning. 

(2)	Collect feedback on Draft SIR Sections in preparation for a potential competitive procurement. The feedback is intended to improve the solicitation request, minimize confusion, and mitigate risks related to Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) equipment and sources.

The FAA welcomes responses from all vendors. Due to the benefits to the FAA of a vendors having quality control and configuration management over all aspects of the contract, including the production process, the agency is currently considering limiting the competition to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)i.e. vendors that design, manufacture, and sell their own productsof the required equipment. This limitation would not preclude OEMs from partnering with small or large distributors or integrators as long as the OEM is the prime contractor.

This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management Policy 3.2.1.2.1 Market Analysis (April 2013) and 3.2.1.3.11.1 General (January 2010).  

INCUMBENT CONTRACTOR

There is no incumbent contractor for this procurement.

NATURE OF COMPETITION

The acquisition strategy for the potential procurement has not been determined at this time.

NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE

MARKET SURVEY INSTRUCTIONS 

(1)	The FAA has included an Equipment Capabilities response matrix (Attachment 1) with the draft requirements identified.  Please complete the matrix indicating whether the requirement can be met without modifying your existing equipment, and include any additional comments that may clarify an understanding of the requirement. If the requirement cannot be met without modifying the existing equipment, please provide an explanation of the requisite modifications necessary to accomplish the function, or describe the noncompliance. Please use the following naming convention:

MSP Market Survey-Equipment Capabilities_(insert your company name).xlsx

(2)	Please answer Yes (Y) or No (N) to the questions in MSP Market Survey-SOW Compliance Matrix (Attachment 2) using the following naming convention: 

MSP Market Survey-SOW Compliance Matrix_(insert your company name).doc

(3)	The FAA is looking for information to assess the affordability of the proposed Multi-System Platform (MSP) acquisition.  As outlined in Attachment 3, please fill out the requested information and use the table to provide information on your companys expected MSP equipment pricing.  You are not bound by the pricing you submit for this Market Survey.  The FAA will consider any information you submit as Company Private Information and will not divulge the information outside the team working on the proposed MSP acquisition.  Please use the following naming convention:

MSP Market Survey-Pricing_(insert your company name).docx.

(6)	Identify in any format you choose the full set of line replaceable units (LRU). 

RFI/DRAFT SIR INSTRUCTIONS

The FAA has attached sections of the Draft Screening Information Request (SIR) to obtain industry comments (Attachments 5 through 8).  The FAA intends to conduct an Operational Capabilities Test (OCT) (Attachment 8) as part of the proposal evaluation processes, to be defined in Sections L and M (not released at this time).  Therefore, this early release of a draft MSP OCT Plan is mainly intended to assist potential offerors of pending responsibilities.

Please review all the provided RFI/Draft SIR attachments and provide comments, questions, clarifications, and/or recommendations in the comment matrix format provided in Attachment 9 to assist the FAA in the development of the final solicitation.  Please use the following naming convention:

MSP Draft SIR DTFAWA-15-R-00018-Comment Matrix_(insert your company name).xls

Vendor comments and government responses may be posted to FAACO by the Government.  Therefore, vendor questions and comments should not contain any proprietary or sensitive information. The FAA intends not to include vendor-identifying information in its answers. Topically identical questions may be consolidated for clarity.

Identifiable vendor information will not be shared outside the FAA.

No bidder or pre-proposal conferences are planned, as this is a Market Survey and Request for Information/Draft SIR, not a solicitation request.

DELIVERY OF SUBMITTALS

All responses must be submitted via email to benette.chen@faa.gov no later than December 21, 2015 including MSP MARKET SURVEY AND RFI/DRAFT SIR RESPONSE in the subject line of your email. 

The individual e-mail responses including attachments must be less than 10 MB. As such, vendors are permitted to submit their responses via multiple e-mails if necessary due to the size constraints. Vendors must not password protect or compress (e.g., zip) any submitted files.

<p>The Support Equipment is required at the Organizational and Intermediate (O&amp;I) Levels of Maintenance to support CV-22, MV-22 and CMV-22 site stand-ups. The items are to be provided in accordance with the Attachment 1 Technical Data Package (drawings), which will be provided by the Government upon request to qualified offerors. The minimum and maximum quantities that will be ordered over the life of the IDIQ are identified for each item in the columns above. The minimum quantities identified above will be on the initial delivery order which is intended to be awarded along with the basic IDIQ award. The minimum quantity that may be ordered on any subsequent delivery order is one (1) each for all items.</p>
<p>3. Offerors may submit proposals for either or both lots identified. The Government intends to award one or two five (5) year, Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts, for the twenty (20) PSE items. The Government reserves the right to award both lots as one IDIQ, or as two separate IDIQs. The minimum and maximum quantities to be ordered over the life of the contract(s) are identified in the tables above for each item. Intent is to issue a Delivery Order for the minimum quantities at the time of IDIQ award. Additional quantities may be ordered from time to time as required by the Government.</p>
<p>4. This requirement is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 336413. This requirement is being conducted using Full and Open Competition After Exclusion of Sources procedures per FAR 6.203. Award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable responsible offeror, with acceptable Past Performance. The Government anticipates awarding this contract without discussions with offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. All proposals will be evaluated for compliance with the terms, conditions, and requirements set forth in this solicitation and detailed in Sections L and M below.</p>
<p>5. The Attachment 1 Technical Data Package (drawings) for this procurement contain export-controlled technical data, subject to disclosure restrictions. All requesting offerors must have a current certified DD2345 to obtain the drawings. They will be mailed on a CD to your designated data custodian on your certified DD2345. All Offerors, other than the successful Offeror, are required to destroy all export control data, regardless of form or the media on which it may be recorded, including CDs, data stored on other computer storage devices and paper documents. Offerors shall provide proof of such destruction via signed letter on corporate letterhead to the PCO at the above listed address. The drawings shall be handled in accordance with clauses 252.204-7012, 252.225-7048, 5252.227-9507 and 5252.227-9508.</p>
<p>6. Note that certain CLINs are subject to the Buy American Act, Trade Agreements, and/or restrictions on the acquisition of hand/measuring tools (Berry Act), as identified in the relevant clauses below.</p>
<p>7. Technical Acceptability, Past Performance and Price are the factors that will be evaluated in order to determine whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government. Award will be made to the responsible offeror with acceptable Past Performance who provides the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer (as detailed in Sections L and M below). All responsible Small Businesses may submit a proposal for evaluation. The Government anticipates awarding this contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>8. Technical Evaluation: Offeror's technical proposals will be required to include sufficient information to satisfy evidence of technical acceptability, by meeting the required standards described in Sections L and M. Acceptability is rated on a "pass/fail" basis. For each criteria evaluated, "Acceptable" is defined as demonstrating that the offeror's proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of that particular evaluated criteria. "Unacceptable" is defined as meaning that the proposal does not clearly demonstrate that the proposal meets the minimum requirements of that evaluated criteria. An overall rating of "Technically Acceptable" will require that offeror's proposal receive a rating of "acceptable" in all of the listed criteria. Technical acceptability will require that the offeror has provided sufficiently detailed information to clearly demonstrate that their proposal satisfies each specified requirement. The Offeror has the burden of proof to demonstrate compliance with all of the evaluation factors identified. In presenting material in the proposal, the Offeror is advised that quality of information is more important than quantity. Clarity, brevity, and logical organization should be emphasized during proposal preparation. The Offeror should present enough information to allow the Government to evaluate the offeror's capability to meet the required technical criteria. Failure to address a specific evaluation factor clearly will likely render an offer unacceptable.</p>
<p>9. Price Evaluation: Since this will be an indefinite quantity type contract, "lowest priced offer" shall be determined as follows: Each proposal must include a unit price for each of the line items (CLINs) identified in the lot for which the proposal is being submitted. (Offerors may propose against either one of or both lots). Unit prices for each CLIN shall not vary based on quantity ordered or year when ordered. Total proposed price for evaluation purposes to determine the "lowest price offer" will be the sum of each estimated maximum line item (CLIN) quantity times the proposed unit price quote, for all line items (see table in Section M).</p>
<p>NOTE: There is no guarantee that the evaluated (maximum) quantities will be ordered. These quantities are for proposal price evaluation purposes. The minimum quantity that will be ordered over the life of the contract is identified for each item (for each Lot) in the tables in Paragraph 2 above. Proposed unit prices shall be valid for any quantity ordered, subject to the limitations specified herein.<br /><br />10. All items shall be preserved, packaged, and marked in accordance with best commercial practices. Items shall be delivered to the Government in accordance with delivery information in Section F, though earlier delivery at no additional charge to the Government is acceptable and encouraged. FOB is Destination. Inspection and acceptance will be at Origin (by DCMA).</p>
<p>11. This is a total Small Business Set-Aside in accordance with FAR 19.5.</p>
<p>12. In accordance with DFARS 252.211-7003, all products with a unit price above $5,000 are required to be marked according to the criteria in MIL-STD-130, Identification Marking of US Military Property.</p>

<p>The NAICs code for this requirement is 541320 - Offices of Real Estate Appraisers</p>
<p>I. OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The Office of Real Property Utilization and Disposal (RPUD) provides cost effective, timely, and professional appraisal and related services to the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and to other federal landholding agencies on a reimbursable basis. Services include appraisals in support of disposals, acquisitions, exchanges, and outgrants (leases, easements, licenses and permits), reviews of third party appraisals reports, and consultations. Consulting services include feasibility studies, highest and best use analysis, marketability studies, asset and utilization evaluations, property parcelization recommendations, Enhanced Use Leasing (EUL) feasibility and valuation support, and other related real estate services.</p>
<p>RPUD has a nationwide staff of professional review appraisers with experience preparing technical contract specifications, selecting the most qualified contract appraiser at a reasonable price, and preparing the required Government review of the contract appraisal. RPUD appraisers have extensive experience with the high valued, complex, and controversial assignments involving a wide variety of property types. RPUD contract appraisers could include sole proprietors, partners, corporations, and several other types of business structures.</p>
<p>Fort Worth, TX is home to the Region 7 Real Property Utilization and Disposal Division (7PZ), which is a zonal office of RPUD that encompasses a 15-state zone including Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana.</p>
<p>In order to streamline the procurement process, and provide timely service to internal and external customers, GSA is considering issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for an IDIQ contract for appraisals and appraisal-related services as mentioned above.</p>
<p>GSA is issuing this RFI to obtain responses from appraisal firms and other members of the valuation community in regard to the questions posed in Section II below.</p>
<p>II. QUESTIONS</p>
<p>1. As mentioned in Section I above, 7PZ encompasses a 15-state geographic territory. Appraisal and appraisal-related assignments could be required in any metropolitan area, as well as any rural area within those 15 states, border to border. GSA is seeking the interest of appraisal firms, as well as those in the valuation community, who would be willing and capable of covering as much of that 15-state area as possible. Within that 15-state territory, where would you be willing to work? For instance, the entire territory, certain states, certain metropolitan areas, etc.? Please be specific and list each of the 15 states your firm is willing to work, including metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>2. As mentioned in Question 1 above, appraisal and appraisal-related services could be required in any location within 7PZ's 15-state territory. This oftentimes requires travel to remote and rural areas. Are you willing to travel to rural and remote areas to complete appraisal assignments? Please include any travel restrictions your firm may have.</p>
<p>3. As mentioned in Section I above, RPUD review appraisers seek to select the most qualified appraiser at a reasonable price. When asked for a cost estimate for an appraisal assignment, how is the cost estimate relayed to the requestor? For example, for the fair market value (FMV) appraisal of a 10,000 square foot single tenant office warehouse in a large metropolitan area where you currently conduct business, would you provide a daily rate, total estimated cost per project, or provide pricing in some other way?</p>
<p>4. As mentioned in Question 1 above, appraisal services may be needed in any location within 7PZ's 15-state territory. Additionally, the subject of these assignments include all types of real estate, all types of value, and every interest in real estate. For example, past projects have included, but are not limited to, historic federal buildings, missile siles, residential homes, environmentally contaminated property, easements, mineral rights, air rights, vacant land, large industrial facilities, and many others. What types of property do you have experience appraising?</p>
<p>III. SUBMISSION OF RESPONSES</p>
<p>All interested parties should submit a cover sheet, and responses to the above four questions listed in Section II, clearly marked "Response to RFI - IDIQ Procurement of Real Property Appraisals" . <strong>Responses are due by 5:00 PM central time on December 31, 2015</strong> and submitted via email to terri.marshall@gsa.gov. Submissons are limited to five pages for responses to the four questions, one side per page, plus an additional page for the cover sheet for a total of six pages.</p>
<p>GSA would like to thank you in advance for reviewing this RFI and assisting us in our efforts to plan for the potential IDIQ procurement.</p>
