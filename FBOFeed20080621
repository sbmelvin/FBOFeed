<DESC>On 1 October 2002 the Army mandated the use of a group of Blanket Purchase Agreements BPA for the purchase of office products.  The primary goals of this BPA initiative were to ensure that office product purchases were in compliance with the statutory preferences afforded to products manufactured under the Javis Wagner ODay Act JWOD now known as Ability One and to capture economies of scale.  The purpose of this annoucement is to alert vendors and consortiums of the new procurement of the Army BPAs.  Army Contracting Command Regional Contracting Center Fort Knox intends to procure office products through the issuance of Blanket Purchase Agreements under the GSA Federal Supply Schedules.  RFQ availablity date is estimated October 2008 via Federal Business Opportunites, Army Single Face to Industry and the Fort Knox Contracting web sites.  No hard copy quotes will be issued.  All CONUS Army users are now required to purchase office products through the BPAs.  However, Army installations with onsite self service supply store may use this source to obtain Ability One products.  To the maximum extent practicable the BPA purchases must be made through the DOD EMall.  The Army intends to award sufficient BPAs to ensure adequate delivery coverage consistent with the concept of Army wide BPAs, achieve best value for BPA customers, compliance with the Ability One Program.  Vendors are reminded that the RFQ package will be issued sometime in October 2008.  Vendors should review Fed Biz Ops, ASFI for future annoucement on the issuance of the RFQ.

<a href="mailto:kimberly.luke@mms.gov">Luke, Kimberly B.</a>
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) intends to award a Cost type sole source multiyear contract to the University of Miami in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i),  only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements
This four-year contract will consist of conducting aerial surveys to acquire vertical profiles of selected oceanographic quantities of the Loop Current in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.  These profiles will be deployed from a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) aircraft before, during and after a hurricane interacts with the Loop Current.  The team at the University of Miami is the only known oceanography team that partners with the NOAA Hurricane Center with the required training to participate in such flights.  The NOAA sponsored research at the University of Miami will study the interrelationship between the ocean and atmosphere.  This research will complement the goals of the MMS Loop Current Study.  MMS will enter into a contract with the University of Miami for additional instruments to be deployed from the NOAA aircraft during hurricane flights.  The MMS funded instruments will have additional capabilities from the NOAA instruments and descend to a greater depth in the water column to gather additional data.  This data will provide invaluable information for increased understanding of the Loop Current.  The University of Miami is funded by NOAA to deploy instrumentation and perform data analysis from the instrumentation.  The University of Miami collaborates with NOAA scientists to develop hurricane models.  The University of Miami scientists have a unique capability to deploy airborne profilers fro MMS and perform data analyses that would combine data from both the MMS sponsored and NOAA sponsored studies.  The combination of this unique data will help with MMS modeling efforts to assess the response of the ocean to such short and strong forcing as a hurricane.

<SUBJECT>--Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Contract to University of Miami
<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:kimberly.luke@mms.gov">Luke, Kimberly B.</a>
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS) intends to award a Cost type sole source multiyear contract to the University of Miami in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i),  only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements
This four-year contract will consist of conducting aerial surveys to acquire vertical profiles of selected oceanographic quantities of the Loop Current in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.  These profiles will be deployed from a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) aircraft before, during and after a hurricane interacts with the Loop Current.  The team at the University of Miami is the only known oceanography team that partners with the NOAA Hurricane Center with the required training to participate in such flights.  The NOAA sponsored research at the University of Miami will study the interrelationship between the ocean and atmosphere.  This research will complement the goals of the MMS Loop Current Study.  MMS will enter into a contract with the University of Miami for additional instruments to be deployed from the NOAA aircraft during hurricane flights.  The MMS funded instruments will have additional capabilities from the NOAA instruments and descend to a greater depth in the water column to gather additional data.  This data will provide invaluable information for increased understanding of the Loop Current.  The University of Miami is funded by NOAA to deploy instrumentation and perform data analysis from the instrumentation.  The University of Miami collaborates with NOAA scientists to develop hurricane models.  The University of Miami scientists have a unique capability to deploy airborne profilers fro MMS and perform data analyses that would combine data from both the MMS sponsored and NOAA sponsored studies.  The combination of this unique data will help with MMS modeling efforts to assess the response of the ocean to such short and strong forcing as a hurricane.
