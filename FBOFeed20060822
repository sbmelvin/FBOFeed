<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for an annual maintenance agreement with Delmia Corp to keep the existing seats of Delmia Envision and Quest software up to date with software updates, bug fixes, security patches and other required updates of the software.  NASA/KSC intends to purchase the items from Delmia Corp. Competition is not practical in this instance because Kennedy Space Center has a significant investment in the subject software, both in the cost of the seats owned, and in training personnel to use the software. No other known firms can fulfill this requirement and converting to an alternate software system would be cost prohibitive.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 5th 2006.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

(b)	The Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below.

Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c) 	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.

(d)	If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Deborah Squires, Otway, North Carolina for processing of Otoliths.  This work consists of :  Process up to four hundred (400) otoliths from select species of fish, suitable for microstructural and/or Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS) analysis.  The required criteria for microstructural analysis are that the core or primordial area of each otolith is microscopically visible and (daily) growth increments are visible through the polished surface; each section should be about 15 to 25 microns thick.  Criteria for ICPMS analysis are similar, but may vary with individual species.  The Government will provide epoxy-embedded otoliths, an isomet low speed lapidary saw, access to a dissecting microscope and hot plate, a variety of specialized implements and supplies and a work site.  A college degree is not necessary but a degree in biology (which would include chemistry courses) would be beneficial.  At least 10 years of experience is required.  The work will be performed at the U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, CCFHR Beaufort Laboratory, 101 Pivers Island Road, Beaufort, North Carolina 28516.  The period of performance is September 1, 2006, or date of award, whichever is later, through August 31, 2007, with an option for four additional years of performance.  In order to comply with the debt collection improvement act of 1966, all contractors must be registered in the central contractor registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract.  For information regarding registration in CCR contact the CCR website at www.ccr.gov/index.cfm.  Authority:  41 USC 253(c)(1).  The FSC for this is R499 and the NAICS Code is 541990, small business size standard is $6.5 million. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement.  Deborah Squires is the only known source capable of performing the required processing.  Ms. Squires has a combination of natural and acquired specialty skills in performing the required processing.  It is critical to maintain continuity, constancy of methodology, data quality and reduction of errors in order for the otoliths to be valuable to the laboratory.  Ms. Squires has already processed more than eight hundred dolphinfish otoliths for an ongoing study that began 2000.  There are currently 108 of these left to polish.  Some of these took three years to obtain and are very valuable.  These samples are easily destroyed if over processed.  She has also processed about two hundred larval red porgy otoliths.  These are difficult to process because they are extremely small and easily destroyed if over processed.  There are at least 50 additional larval red porgy samples to prepare.  Otoliths from both of these species should be processed by the same individual in order to obtain the same orientation of sectioning and other aspects of preparation as well as data precision and accuracy.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a proposal.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by 4:00 P.M. August 29, 2006 will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  Evidence must be provided of ability to perform the required procesing.  Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Linda.Mullen@noaa.gov.

To prepare Well Work Packages for input, the contractor may be expected to communicate with Fluids staff and Field Offices to ensure information is complete prior to input into the AFMSS system. Quality Control - Ensures quality control of record input to ensure accurate records.  This includes 1) reviewing completed work for adherence to data standards input on quality and accuracy of well information and 2) identifying and setting priorities in work and ensuring completion.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a Cost-type contract to design, develop, modify, and maintain Government software products in support of Naval Aviation's Ground Proximity Warning System/Terrain Awareness Warning System (GPWS/TAWS) program.

The effort includes software development, tailoring, and incorporation of mission specific requirements for integration of Government-owned algorithms into naval aircraft systems requiring embedded GPWS/TAWS capability.  Specific aircraft supported include the F/A-18A/B/C/D/E/F, EA-6B, T-45, MH-60R/S, AH/UH-1Z/Y, CH-53K, E-2D, MV-22, and potential follow-on aircraft as authorized and funded by OPNAV.  In addition to the completion of software development/tailoring and product verification and validation, all processes are required to maintain, at a minimum, Capability Maturity Model (CMM) Level 3.  NAVAIR will continue to be the designer and developer of Government algorithms to provide this capability, utilizing the Contractor for tailoring the algorithm to incorporate platform specific mission requirements, developing and maintaining all required documentation, providing technical oversight, modifying/correcting fielded software, and maintaining Quality Assurance and Configuration Management.  Software support of fielded algorithms will include, but not be limited to, engineering investigations, engineering change proposals, integration, testing and test equipment, and software maintenance.

NAVAIR intends to award this effort sole source to DCS Corporation, 46641 Corporate Drive, Lexington Park, MD 20653.  This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the authority found in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

The NAVAIR/DCS GPWS/TAWS Integrated Program Team has successfully developed and fielded this capability aboard the Navy's F/A-18 and AV-8B tactical aircraft.  DCS is the only company with the extensive experience, background, and knowledge to provide the GPWS/TAWS software engineering and design, coding, system/platform integration, test and support efforts required to meet naval aviation's requirements.  As such, DCS is the only known source that can meet the program schedule without causing unacceptable delays in meeting the Navy's operational requirements. The follow-on GPWS/TAWS software contract will be awarded to DCS due to the substantial increase in cost that will not be recovered through competition and to avoid unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.

It is anticipated that the FSC code will be 6340 (Aircraft Alarm and Signal Systems).  

The estimated period of performance is five years.  Numbered note 22 applies. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This synopsis is for informational purposes only.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. Interested parties may contact Ms. Candice Anderson by e-mail at candice.anderson@navy.mil or may fax information to (301) 757-6516, Attn: Candice Anderson, Code 2.5.1.8.1.7.  Please respond via email or fax; no phone calls will be accepted.  

Note:  Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DoD activity.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government is not committed nor obligated to pay for the information provided and no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of this synopsis.

<CONTACT>Edward Hiteshew 850-235-5362 , or Contracting Officer Mary Hines at 850-235-5389.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, Florida intends to issue a modification to contract N61331-06-C-0004 with BriarTek Incorporated, 112 East Delray Avenue, Alexandria, Virginia for the continued installation and validation of Man Overboard Indicator (MOBI) systems on 5 US Navy ships.  This modification also requires contractor support to provide the necessary technical and management services in support of the MOBI program consisting of the development and verification of SHIPALTs and BOATALTs, preparation for and during shipboard inspections where the MOBI system will have an impact, system integration issues, EMI testing and provisioning of MOBI hardware to the fleet, integrated logistics support (ILS) modifications, one-per-person transmitter testing and evaluation.   This contract modification is required because fleet deployments of the MOBI system have significantly increased as the MOBI system has drastically increased personnel safety. These require!  ments were only recently defined and were not known at the time the procurement quantities for this contract were established.  This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  The USN has been evaluating Commercial Off The Shelf, Non-Developmental Item (COTS/NDI) Man Overboard Indicator (MOBI) systems since FY99.  Based upon results of multiple Field Demonstration Tests, the USN has decided to purchase and install MOBI systems on all USN ships.   The MOBI system manufactured by BriarTek is the only system capable of transmitting a unique code that identifies the specific transmitter that has been activated.   This unique code eliminates confusion during instances when multiple personnel are thrown overboard simultaneously and will aid in identifying which individuals are still in the water and in need of rescue.  Because of this unique code, BriarTek Incorporated is the only company that can meet all of the US Navy requirements.  Additionally, this effort is sole sou!  rce because NSWC PC has awarded three previous contracts to install th e BriarTek-manufactured MOBI system on a total of 146 ships thus far.  This contract is for the acquisition of engineering services for continued development and deployment of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Therefore, there are no other sources that can satisfy this requirement.  NAICS Code:  334220, Size Standard:  500.    A modification will be done to the contract on or about 08 Sep 06.   The point of contact is Contract Specialist: Edward Hiteshew, Code XPS2, NSWC PC, 100 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001 or email: Edward.hitshew@navy.mil.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a requirement to purchase a Nuclisens EasyMag Automatic Nucleic Acid Extractor. The purchase of this instrument from Biomerieux, Inc., 100 Rodolphe Street, Durham, NC 27704 is requested to complement the current research in the Unit of Intercellular Interactions, studying concomitant viral infection by detecting viral replication and gene expression by nucleic acid detection.  The extraction of these nucleic acids is a tedious and lengthy process and traditional extraction methods do not allow the concomitant extraction of RNA and DNA, which forces investigators to perform a dedicated nucleic acid extraction for each nucleic acid.  This equipment uses  BOOM technology, which is the only extraction procedure that allows the simultaneous extraction of both RNA and DNA in a single procedure, reducing the time and cost associated with the extraction of both nucleic acid separately.  The Nuclisens EasyMag is the only automated extractor that allows the simultaneous extraction of 24 samples in less than an hour. It is the only extractor that uses the same protocol irrespective of the starting volume and the nature of the sample and will expand throughput, as well as enable researchers to purify nucleic acids from hard to extract samples such as precious clinical specimens.  To the best of the Governments knowledge the proposed contractor is the only known source that can provide the components.  Interested vendors may identify in writing their interest with a capability statement to the Contracting Office prior to the closing date of this notice.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however; all responses received, before the closing date, of this announcement will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  It is anticipated that the Request for Quotation (RFQ) NIH-NIDDK-06-988 will be available fifteen (15) days after the publication date of this synopsis.  Receipt of quotations will be due ten (10) days after the release of the RFQ.  The anticipated award date is September 20, 2006.

<DESC>NASA intends to award a sole source contract to Human Systems Knowledge Network, Inc. (HSKNI), pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source.  This procurement is to develop a questionnaire and survey between 30 and 50 diverse corporations for information on program office size, structure, organization, and practices, and to develop a series of algorithms that might be useful in sizing future program offices. The results of this study will be used to inform decisions on the establishment and operations of subsequent program offices. Only HSKNI has the infrastructure in place that is capable of delivering the results in four months from contract initiation.  HSNKI's unique knowledge-sharing network provides its members with an opportunity to benchmark their corporate program and project management practices and to exchange information on project management processes and practices with over 75 worldwide organizations. The member base and client list uniquely enables HSKNI to rapidly and reliably collect corporate data on program office implementation.  There are no alternative sources that have established and sustained a knowledge-sharing network with such diverse corporate entities to support the development of benchmarks of program management practices, structures, and size across multiple industries.	 The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 HSKNI is the only source that can meet the Government needs.   Any other firms desiring consideration are requested to fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days of the date of publication of this synopsis to the NASA's GSFC office and contact listed below, See Note(s) 12. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for three (3) months of meteorological data collection research throughout the Great Lakes. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the data from AirDat, LLC as the only know source that can meet Agency Requirements. Tropospheric Airborne Meteorological Data Reporting (TAMDAR) sensors are installed on a regional airline fleet to collect meteorological data.	AirDat, LLC owns and controls the equipment and the intellectual content of the TAMDAR Data.  The data will be used to establish a system for collecting and disseminating weather conditions from aircraft operating below 25,000 ft, and will be used for aviation safety.   It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer similar data that would meet this requirement and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.	 The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 28 Aug 2006. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has a requirement to renew pager service from Arch Wireless, Inc. from September 14, 2006 through September 13, 2007.  This pager service provides an important function and complements NTSB wireless phone service as a key communication tool in remote areas of the country. If the NTSB decided to compete its pager requirement, it would have to purchase all new pagers and obtain new pager numbers in addition to the monthly charges for service.  By renewing its service with Arch Wireless, the NTSB significantly reduces its expenses by utilizing the pagers it already owns.  Renewing service with Arch Wireless provides the best overall value to the government because it can use equipment it has already purchased. The NTSB decision to award a sole source order is based on the fact that Arch Wireless is the only company that provides pager service for the NTSB, and if another company were awarded this requirement, the NTSB would be forced to obtain new pager numbers and expend additional funds to purchase equipment.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS!  The 45th Contracting Squadron has a sole source requirement for Bio-Rad Laboratories custom master mix, 25mL, catalog #: 172-5004CUST (19 each), to include all shipping costs.  The requested delivery to Patrick AFB, Fla. will be approximately thirty (30) days after receipt of a purchase order.  This is a Sole Source with Bio-Rad Laboratories - Life Science Research IAW FAR 6.302-1.  Bio-Rad Laboratories-Life Science Research is the only source capable of fulfilling the government?s requirement as they are the sole manufacturer and distributor of the 172-5004CUST custom master mix, which is used by all other organizations participating in a cooperative research and development program of which MCA-B is a part.  MCA-B is in the process of determining the quality of product synthesized using Bio-Rad?s 172-5004CUST master mix.  To change the source of the reagent mixture during this examination period would seriously hinder the process by creating more process variables.  All other programs cooperating with MCA-B use the 172-5004CUST master mix from Bio-Rad in their research and development synthesis.  Changing the source of the reagent mixture would seriously hinder cooperative analysis efforts by creating more process variables.  Therefore, for quality control and program continuity purposes, Bio-Rad 172-5004CUST master mix needs to be utilized.  No solicitation documents exist at this time.  This item/service utilizes Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 2819 with a business size of 500 employees and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 325998.  Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, the government will consider any responses from capable sources received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis.  45 CONS/LGCB has determined that Bio-Rad Laboratories ?

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst NJ intends to enter into negotiations on a non-competitive basis with DRS Sustainment Systems Inc. (DRS SSI), St Louis MO for the procurement of updates to software required for replacement of the Radiation Hazard Monitor     (RHM) Probe used on Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) High Power Device Test Subsystems (HPDTS).  Due to the obsolescence of the RHM Probe used on the HPDTS, a replacement probe was identified.     To support this replacement probe, updates to the station software as well as to the HPDTRHM-ST (RHM self-test) and the HPDTIO-ST (input/output self test) are required.     All software will include updates to corresponding software design documents.
The Government intends to procure the software updates for the replacement RHM probe under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1.       DRS SSI is the original developer of the source code for the RHM Probe currently in use.     Source code for current RHM probe must be maintained within the software.     DRS SSI software developers are familiar with the current requirements for operation of the RHM Probe and were involved in identifying the replacement probe. No other source possesses this knowledge base. Procuring the updates from another source would result in duplicative cost to the Government.       This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.         However, the Government will consider all responses received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.           Information received as a result of this notice will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The US Army, TACOM-Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce, Picatinny, NJ anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the production of  the Setter to Platform Cable Assembly for the Enhanced Portable  Inductive Artillery Fuze Setter (EPIAFS).  The RFP will be for one  production year with options for an additional four production years,  for a total five production years. The EPIAFS Setter to Platform Cable Assembly is part of the EPIAFS system which will be capable of setting  the XM982 Excalibur projectiles and all NATO standard inductive fuzes.  The EPIAFS system consists of three electronic components: A  Platform Integration Kit (PIK), a Handheld Setter,and a Setter to  Platform Cable Assembly.  The Platform Integration Kit (PIK) is a  gun-mounted data processor that sends and manages the data stream  from multiple interfaces. The Handheld Setter is a handheld device  which inductively couples data and power to either the Excalibur  projectile or applicable fuzes.  When the Setter to Platform Cable  Assembly is connected to a Howitzer with an automated Fire Control  System, such as the Light Weight (LW) 155 Towed Howitzer M777A2 or  the M109A6 Paladin Digital Fire Control System, the EPIAFS can receive  and inductively supply a stream of data, power,and timing pulses to  initialize a precision guided GPS projectile such as Excalibur.   Excalibur is a GPS Precision Guided Munition which requires power and Gun, Target, Fuze, and GPS data to be sent over an inductive  interface to initialize the projectile. Funds are available for this acquisition.  These Cable Assemblies will be furnished as Government  Furnished Material to the EPIAFS systems contractor.  The Request for  Proposal which will address a requirement to produce these cable  assemblies will be posted on or about September 6, 2006.  Point of  contact for this requirement is William D. Tenz, AMSTA-AQ-APC,  Bldg. 9, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000. Email:  wtenz@pica.army.mil.  Numbered Note 1 applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>This contract covers disassembly, inspection, and repair of the blade servomotors, oil heads, mechanical seals, and shaft sleeve for two 4.1 MW S-Turbines at R.D. Willis Powerhouse (Town Bluff Dam), near Jasper, Texas. For the last three years, maint enance personnel have indicated that the blade servomotor oil was becoming hot from excessive pump operation.  Isolation of the oil lines going to the servomotor piston and subsequent monitoring of pressurized leakage rates has resulted in the determinatio n that the rings on the piston are leaking several gallons per minute or there is severe scoring of the cylinder the piston rides in.  Plant personnel have indicated that metal shavings have been seen on the oil filters as well as some sort of black hard r ubbery material. It is also possible that the oil head is damaged and leaking.  Other areas of work, separate from the blade servomotor, are the inspections of the turbine shaft mechanical seals and shaft sleeve. The turbine shaft mechanical seals have sho wn excessive leakage when the bearing oil leakage return lines and water leakage drain lines have been monitored. The turbine shaft sleeves are believed to be worn and need to be inspected and possibly replaced.   This action will be in compliance with the Service Contract Act as Amended and for all construction with be in compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act as amended.  Work is to be preformed at RD Willis Dam at Sam Rayburn Lake Texas.  Selection critera are as fo llows: Factor 1.  Past Performance and Experience (PPE).

Include relevant contracts, including contract numbers, and points of contact with telephone numbers.   Within factor 1, sub-factors below will be evaluated.  Both subfa ctors are of equal weight.  All subfactors will be rated as: SATISFACTORY/UNSATISFACTORY.  A subfactor rating of UNSATISFACTORY will cause the entire factor to be rated as UNSATISFACTORY.  An UNSATISFACTORY rating will preclude a contract award. The Go vernment will call references to verify PPE information.  The Government also reserves the right to use other information, e.g. personal knowledge, preaward survey, past performance information systems, etc. during the evaluation. (2)     Sub-Factor 1.

A rating of UNSATISFACTORY will cause the entire factor to be  rated as UNSATISFACTORY.  An UNSATISFACTORY rating will preclude a contract award. Include relevant contracts, including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers, size of units, and pressures.Factor 3. Price. It is the governments int ent to award to the offeror who receives a Satisfactory in both Factors 1 and 2, and who has the lowest price.

Description:  The Ram Air Control Valve is part of the aircraft Environmental Control System (ECS).  This valve modulates the ram air flowing through the pre-cooler heat exchanger in response to current signals from the temperature controller.  The variation in the current maintains bleed air temperature downstream of the pre-cooler heat exchanger to a predetermined constant value.  This results in a controlled bleed air temperature downstream of the heat exchanger that is within safe operating parameters of the downstream components.  The Ram Air Flow Control Valve consists of an actuator, inseparable air duct assembly, left and right hand doors, electrical harness assembly, and servo control valve. 
Destination:  Shipping instruction to be given by PMS. 
Required Delivery:  3 EA, every thirty days ARO until order is complete.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The General Services Administration has identified a requirement for experienced consulting firms or teams to provide professional real estate support and relocation and acquisition services within the geographic area of the New England region.  The period of performance will be a base year with four, one-year option periods.  This procurement is identified as a small business set-aside. It is anticipated that three to five separate contracts may be awarded from this solicitation.  Successful firms will be awarded a firm-fixed price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (IDIQ).   

The major requirement for this contract is to secure and expand approximately twenty-six (26) Northern Border Crossing Stations which are to be upgraded to accommodate current U.S. Security Requirements. It is anticipated that at each port of entry, 3-10 privately owned properties will need to be acquired for National Security purposes. It is estimated that each fiscal year, five border crossings will be impacted; therefore, the work load could range from 6 to 50 parcels annually for the next five years.

Joint venture arrangements will be considered and evaluated for demonstrated ability to provide a quality relocation and acquisition effort.  Respondents must demonstrate capability and a planned approach to perform all real estate contract services within the designated geographical area of consideration.  Supplemental information, such as representative examples of prior relevant projects is encouraged.  The minimum guarantee for each contract is $500.00. The total cumulative fee is a maximum of $100,000.00 for each one year period.  A separate fee will be negotiated for each separate task order. The fee will be based on the overhead, profit, and employee wage rates established in the contract. 
Services as prescribed for each separate project will be firm fixed price. Successful firms will be selected using a best value approach with technical criteria being approximately equal in importance to cost/price.

<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration solicits sources for COTS software and information technology support services required by the GSA Public Buildings Service.  If the results of this market survey indicate that there are at least 2 (two) or more potentially qualified sources that can support this requirement, the Government may consider the release of a competitive requirement.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit information on IT services and support for commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS) that will provide a web-based, workflow tool for overtime utilities estimating. 
  
The Public Buildings Service is the largest public real estate organization in the country and a provider of workspace and workplace solutions to more than 100 federal agencies representing over a million federal civilian workers in 2,000 communities.  This comprises over 1,600 government-owned buildings, or approximately 55 percent of GSA's total inventory. The remaining 45 percent is in privately owned leased facilities.
All PBS assets (which include human capital, technological resources and physical assets) are deployed in two fundamental activities. The first is space acquisition through new construction or leasing. This is a project management activity that translates customer agency?s space needs into discrete requirements, marshals the resources necessary to fulfill the requirements and manages the execution of the project, resulting in the delivery of workspace. The second is the life cycle asset management of the acquired space. This includes the physical supervision of the buildings in the portfolio; fulfillment of contractual obligations to our customer agencies; ensuring continuation of operations cycle-asset management of the acquired space; ensuring continuity of operations; determining prudent investment in maintaining a property and ultimately, when and by what means an asset will be disposed of at the end of its useful life.
Listed below are preliminary requirements that the Government desires in an application:

?	Designed and coded in an open, interoperable architecture that is extensible for future requirements.
?	Incorporates workflow to guide user(s) through process(es).
?	Automatically generate emails to notify users of next step in process(es).  
?	Provide a tool for an overtime utilities estimate for the Fiscal Year.
?	Provide the ability to integrate information with other web-based applications.
?	Web-based solution must accommodate approximately 300 users.
?	Automatically charge costs on a monthly basis.
?	Provide the ability to pro-rate costs.
?	Cross-check information for duplicate charges and will automatically flag duplicate charges.
?	Use estimates to auto-populate forms.
?	Archiving capability.
?	Generate audit trails.
?	Generate forms in both .html and .pdf form.  
?	Generate reports.
?	Provide system and user administration. 
?	Enforce access privileges based on defined user roles.
?	Validate user inputs against business rules.
?	Generate forms in both .html and .pdf form.  
?	Generate reports.

AMENDMENT 1: CONTRACTORS MUST SEND DESCRIPTIONS OF THEIR PRODUCTS VIA E-MAIL TO JUSTIN.PINKNEY@GSA.GOV OR VIA U.S. MAIL TOT HE ADDRESS BELOW C/O MR. PINKNEY.

THE DUE DATE FOR THEIS NOTICE IS EXTENDED TO AUGUST 31, 2006 AT 3PM EST.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to respond to the following questions that have been received from potential contractors.  The responses to all questions will be posted as modifications to the Sources Sought Notice, so that all potential contractors will have the same information.

It should be remembered that this requirement is still in the planning stages.  The purpose of the Sources Sought Notice was to do market research to determine what sources are available to the Government.  No final decisions have been made regarding how this requirement will be solicited. 

1.	QUESTION:  Is it possible to arrange a meeting with the Government to discuss the timeframes and procedures for going forward with the requirement?

	RESPONSE:  A number of potential offerers have requested to meet with the Government to discuss the requirement.  The Government is not currently holding any meetings for the following reasons:

a.	The procurement is still in the planning stage and definite decisions have not been made as to how to proceed with the procurement,
b.	All information about the requirement (including answers to contractors questions) will be posted with the Sources Sought Notice on the FedBizzOpps website, and
c.	When the actual solicitation begins, a Pre-Proposal Conference will be held with all potential offerers.  At that time questions can be asked, and responses will be provided to all potential offerers. 

2.	QUESTION:  Can you provide a better description of what you want in ? 1) site management and 2) remedial action design?

	RESPONSE:  The Performance Work Statement (PWS), Task Inventory and Work Breakdown Structure have been posted at the FedBizzOpps website and at the EPA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) website (website address was given in Modification #1).  These documents should provide the description that you require.

3.	QUESTION:  Is there any restrictions to submitting as a team?

	RESPONSE:  If the Government determines to set-aside part of this requirement, any teams would need to abide by the applicable eligibility requirements.

4.	QUESTION:  Can you submit multiple responses as a prime sub relationship?

	RESPONSE:  A firm may propose on both Region 9 RAC procurements but at their own risk.  The Agency is intending to award two separate contracts, and it is in the Agency?s interest to have alternate sources available to perform remediation work and this could factor into selection decisions.

5.	QUESTION:  Is EPA planning on letting this type of contract in FY07?

	RESPONSE:  No, award is planned for FY08.

6.	QUESTION:  Will there be multiple awards?

	RESPONSE:  This will not be a multiple award as described in FAR 16.504(c).  The Government is planning on awarding two separate contracts.  One contract will be done using full and open competition.  The other contract will be done as a set-aside.  The exact nature of the set-aside has not yet been determined.  The Sources Sought Notice is being done as market survey to provide additional data to assist in making this determination.  Consequently, all interested firms are encouraged to submit their capability statements.

7.	QUESTION:  The Statement of Work (SOW) indicates that this contract will not be utilized on federal facilities, and that the contract holder may be asked to provide remediation services in Mexico and Canada.  Can you please clarify?

	RESPONSE:  The statement is correct.  This contract will not be used for work on federal facilities (another contract is available for that type of work).  Also, a possibility exists that work might have to be done in Canada or Mexico, and that requirement is part of the Statement if Work (SOW).

8.	QUESTION:  Your NAICS classification says 562910 Remediation Services.  This NAICS has two parts to it.  Remediation Services that has a size standard of $13 million in revenue, and the other part, Environmental Remediation that is restricted to firms with less then 500 employees.  The text of your Sources Sought Notice uses 500 employees, but calls it Remediation Services.  Do you mean Environmental Remediation?

	RESPONSE:  The FedBizzOpps website provides the titles for the NAICS, and for NAICS 562910 it provides Remediation Services.  This requirement is for Environmental Remediation, and the size standard used is 500 employees.



The response date for this notice is unchanged at September 8, 2006.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   Pathophysiological Progression and Relationships for Selected Endpoints Amendment #1 Technical Questions Question #1:  It is noted in the background that this will serve as preliminary work for the development of a pathophysiological progression model to characterize  toxicity endpoints used in human health assessments.  Will this be a single request or are similar follow up requests envisioned by the EPA?  Answer:  The EPA expects further requests, but those requests are dependent on the results from this preliminary project. Question #2:  What number of  "critical effects" does the EPA anticipate will be identified from the chemical toxicity assessment databases (Task 2)? Answer:  The EPA has not identified a specific number at this point. The EPA would rather narrow down a number of effects after initial identification based on the availability of  data on pathophysiological progression to adversity of specific effects (5 fully characterized effects would be acceptable at a later stage following identification of effects).  Question #3:  Is it anticipated that a decision will be made between the EPA and the offeror as to the number of  critical effects on which a progression model will be formulated and is there a decision process by which "critical effects" will be prioritized? Answer:  The decision of the number (5 offered as tentative, although there may be more effects of interest), as well as the prioritization criteria will  both be made between the EPA and the offer, after award of an order. The due date for quotes has been extended.  Offers shall submit 1 copy of their quotation that references RFQ-OH-06-00208, no later than August 28, 2006 at 3:00 PM (EST) to Scott A. Fogle, at fogle.scott@epa.gov or via fax at 513  487-2107.   Email is the preferred method.   Pathophysiological Progression and Relationships for Selected Endpoints This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information  included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-06-00208.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-11.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses.  The NAICS code is 541710, and the SBA size standard is 500  employees.   I.    Project Identification:   Pathophysiological Progression and Relationships for Selected Endpoints II.   Period of Performance:   Award date to December 15, 2007 III. Estimated Labor Hours:  540 hours    Background   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of  Research and Development (ORD), National Center for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) is currently developing methodologies and information sources to use as guidelines for acute exposure to various compounds, including air toxics.  Overall, this project is being proposed as a means to advance the  science that may be utilized in making estimates of safe exposures with special focus on inhalation exposure scenarios.  The goal of this project is to identify/categorize toxicological endpoints along a pathophysiological continuum.  This will serve as preliminary work for the development of a  pathophysiological progression model to characterize toxicity endpoints used in human health assessments. An endpoint is defined in this document as an objective or subjective (e.g. self reported symptoms in a study using human research subjects) measure that serves as an indicator of a response  (normal and/or pathological) to chemical/toxicant exposure.   A compendium containing the categorization of endpoints along a pathophysiological continuum (from no effect to adverse effect) would serve to do the following: (1) Weigh the relative importance of effects induced by a chemical or  across chemicals, (2) Provide information valuable in the determination of species sensitivity and relevance of animal effects to humans, (3) Provide interpretative, descriptive and graphical information that can aid in the standardization and uniformity of chemical health assessments, and (4)  Serve as a reference source for chemical-mode of action (MOA) characterization. Tasks The contractor shall complete the tasks below in accordance with the delivery schedule. Task 1.   Preparation of Joint Quality Management (JQM)/Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP).  The contractor shall  prepare, submit and adhere to a (JQM/QAPP) specifically designed for this requirement in accordance with the template in Appendix A.  The JQM/QAPP shall be submitted to the EPA Project Officer for review and approval.  Task 2.   Identify the most prominent critical effects available in chemical  assessment databases The Contractor shall search chemical toxicity assessment databases, identifying the critical effects within those assessments, and deriving a list of those biological endpoints used as critical effects, (i.e., those toxicological endpoints on which the assessment is based).  A  severity categorization report (attached) is provided as an example of similar type of database analysis and integration. Task 3.   Populate the Pathophysiological Progression Model diagram with the endpoints obtained from task 2, and elaborate on alternative severity categorization paradigms The  contractor shall place the critical effects identified in task 2 along a severity continuum using the Pathophysiological Progression Model (Figure 1). The Pathophysiological Progression Model shall be used as the model to be populated with the critical endpoints selected from the chemical toxicity  databases.  The contractor shall proceed to provide scientific rationale for the placement of specific critical endpoints along this diagram. (Figure 1) Pathophysiological Progression Model Task 4.   Provide a series of charts with detailed information on the endpoints as in Task 3, and criteria  for placement along the Pathophysiological Progression Model  The contractor shall generate a descriptive elaboration of the rationale for the categorization scheme in task 3, along with tabular and graphical representation of the data.  For example, columns can be generated within tables for  critical effects, temporal or dose association identified, categorization rationale, etc.  Task 5.   Produce a final report with recommendations for further analysis The contractor shall produce a final report describing the approaches used to identify and categorize the critical effects selected  along the Pathophysiological Progression Model.  The contractor shall provide recommendations for further analysis for the development of criteria to characterize pathophysiological processes, and identify data rich pathophysiological processes as candidates for future case study(ies).   Identification and proposal of alternative severity categorization schemes shall also be addressed.  In summary, the final report shall contain an introduction to the issue, approach used for obtaining and analyzing the information, graphical and tabular representation of the data and  recommendations for alternative approaches and further data analysis Task 6.   Produce an abstract and presentation to be delivered by the EPA at a Scientific Meeting in December 2007. The contractor shall produce a series of slides that summarize the contents of the final report which will be  submitted for presentation at scientific meeting, and used as a general presentation for the Pathophysiological Progression Project.  Travel by contractor staff will be required in support of this task.  The travel location will be determined at a later date.  The travel location will be in the  U.S.  Upon completion of the travel, the contractor shall generate and submit to the PO, a detailed Contractor Travel Report, within (5) working days of completing the travel. DELIVERABLES SCHEDULE The Contractor shall provide written products to the Project Officer as specified in the above  tasks.  All products must be of high quality, written in a clear concise style, with a logical organization and presentation.  Products not adhering to these standards or substantially lacking scientific quality will not be accepted.  The Contractor shall provide all written materials and responses  in both hard copy and electronic format. Hard copies of all completed text, tables, and figures shall be submitted to Project Officer for review and approval.  Authors shall also submit word processing disks or email electronic files.   Estimated Delivery Schedule The Contractor shall deliver  all written materials and professional services in accordance with the following time schedule: Tasks                                  				   Dates Task 1.

VISN 10, which encompasses the VA Medical Centers in Brecksville, Ohio; Chillicothe, Ohio; Cincinnati, Ohio; Cleveland, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Dayton, Ohio; and Fort Thomas, Kentucky; and VISN 11, which encompasses the VA Medical Centers in Ann Arbor, Michigan; Battle Creek, Michigan; Danville, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Indianapolis, Indiana; Marion, Indiana; and Saginaw, Michigan has a requirement for Repricing of Health Care Provider Invoices Services. The purpose of the contract is to assist the VA in meeting its economic objective to obtain high quality, accessible health care services at reasonable prices to serve the nation's veterans.  When eligible veterans receive their healthcare from providers in the private sector, the contract allows participating VAMCs to share in the savings available through discount agreements.  The contractor identifies savings for a variety of health care services including hospitalization, outpatient care, ambulatory surgery, behavioral health, ancillary and other services. The contractor's fee is a percentage of savings on a per-claim basis with no additional fee beyond the percentage of savings. The government has determined that Heritage Health Solutions is the only SDVOSB small business concern capable of satisfying this requirement. If other SDVOSB feel they can meet the needs of the government they should submit their qualifications, capabilities, etc., to the Contracting Officer no later than May 30, 2006. Information submitted will be evaluated with final determination resting with the Contracting Officer. All questions and comments shall be addressed in writing to the Administrative Contracting Officer either by FAX at (937) 268-6511, Extension 3094 or by email at Robert.Ivey@med.va.gov. See numbered note__.

<DESC>The 642 AES Squadron (A-10) Aircraft Program is conducting a market survey for the continuation of Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL)/Improved Data Modem (IDM) development and integration into the A-10 fleet in conjunction with the on-going Precision Engagement (PE) modification, currently with Lockheed-Martin Systems Integration (LMSI), Owego NY.  The 642 AES Squadron anticipates a 3-year contract with multiple pricing arrangements.

The aircraft is a single place, pressurized, low wing and tail aircraft powered by two General Electric TF34-GE-100A turbo-fan engines, capable of worldwide deployment and operation from austere bases with minimal support equipment.  Major aircraft modification programs, such as Integrated Flight and Fire Control Computer (IFFCC) and Precision Engagement (PE) are currently in progress. The IFFCC began fielding in 2003 and the PE in 2006.  These programs will provide the A/OA 10 with new combat capabilities to employ a variety of smart weapons plus improved situational awareness, and enhanced target identification and designation capability.

The A-10 SADL/IDM contract will include requirements for software development and integration, systems engineering, system / sub-system integration, program integration, program management, configuration management and configuration status accounting, development and preparation of source data for technical orders / data / publications, support equipment, procurement and / or manufacturing, and equipment installation and flight test support.  Development and integration of a SADL/IDM modification into the A-10 fleet has already begun under the existing A-10 Prime contract.  In addition, the first Lot of Group A aircraft installation kits have been procured under the existing A-10 Prime contract.  The A-10 SADL/IDM contract will continue these on-going efforts. 

At a minimum, the SADL/IDM development and integration contractor will need associate contractor agreements with the current Prime contractor and OEM contractor (LMSI Owego NY and Northrop-Grumman Bethpage NY, respectively).  Some level of data rights and proprietary data are owned by LMSI and NG.  LMSI owns the majority of the System Integration Laboratory equipment and operates the SIL at the LMSI  Owego facility.  The SADL/IDM contractor will be required to use the LMSI SIL in the performance of this contract.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION.  It is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources.  Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large or small business in relation to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code 336413, Other Aircraft Parts and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing.  All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be awarded a DoD contract.  Interested sources are encouraged to first register as a source on the PIXS Web Site (http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).  In addition, interested firms should submit sufficient information that will permit evaluation of technical capabilities.   Information should be pertinent and specific to A-10 SADL/IDM development and integration and address the following:  (1) Experience:  An outline of previous or current contracts of the same type and scale as defined in this synopsis; (2) Personnel:  Names, professional qualifications and specific experience of personnel who may be assigned to key positions for this contract; (3) Identification and discussion of unique qualifications and ability to perform in the capacity of SADL/IDM development and integration with the A/OA-10 weapon system, along with discussion of the business relationships (and capability to establish those relationships) envisioned in this role; (4) Any other specific and pertinent information that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), Bio-containment Procurement Branch is seeking qualified business sources that can provide assistance to complete the preparation of an assessment of the potential for environmental effects under the National Environmental Policy Act for the National Bio and Agro Defense Facility (NBAF).  The Environmental Impact Study (EIS) contractor shall provide expert advice by providing analysis, technical guidance, and recommendation on both the appropriate process requirements and all relevant issues and impact assessments.

The NBAF is envisioned to provide the nation with the first integrated agricultural, zoonotic disease, and public health research, development, testing, and evaluation facility with the capability to address threats from human pathogens, high-consequence zoonotic disease agents, and foreign animal diseases.  The facility would also provide the additional infrastructure required for threat and vulnerability assessments and for testing and evaluating promising foreign animal disease countermeasures.  NBAF will support the complementary missions of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Human Health and Services (HHS) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).

The proposed 520,000 square foot building must provide modern, safe and secure biocontainment laboratories of sufficient capacity to provide animal testing capability needed for the licensure of the human disease vaccines; defend against high-consequence human and foreign animal diseases in livestock; and provide the essential DHS infrastructure requirements for threat characterization, forensics, and detection. The co-location of human and agricultural Biodefense efforts will create an integrated and comprehensive system to rapidly recognize and characterize biological agents in human and animal populations, food, water, agriculture, and the environment. Since the U. S. is lacking in such critical national capability, acquiring an operational facility as soon as possible is of high priority.   The facility will be comprised of Biosafety Levels 2, 3, 3Ag & 4 laboratories, vivarium and associated support spaces located on a site ranging is size from 30 to 100 acres.  The Government anticipates 3-5 sites will be included in this contract and result in 3-5 independent environmental impact studies conducted concurrently.
 It is anticipated that at least some of the information needed to evaluate the potential for significance of impacts to the human environment will be provided by the Government, directly from the candidate site, or other stakeholders.  In other cases, the EIS Contractor shall collect supplementary information as needed.  In all cases, the EIS Contractor shall review this information.  The EIS Contractor shall assist with the administrative process of preparing and completing the document.  The EIS Contractor shall fulfill the following major objectives in all tasks listed in this statement of work:
 Inspect the accuracy, validity, integrity, and completeness of environmental information provided to the Government by external Federal and non-Federal stakeholders, identify shortfalls, and make recommendations to the Government for resolution and acceptance;  
Assist the Government and/or the Government?s NEPA Planning and Public Outreach Contractor with scoping and other public coordination activities associated with the environmental impact analysis process;
Assist the Government in coordinating environmental issues with other Federal agencies;
For the purposes of advising the Government - To identify and anticipate issues from information provided by the government and other stakeholders that may lead to either or both (1) a significant environmental impact; or (2) a concern with evaluating the level of significance; 
Identify information gaps that may hinder an appropriate evaluation of significance and collect, analyze, and validate the needed information for the EIS Contractor?s use;  
Identify appropriate options to resolve potentially significant environmental impacts, research the risks and benefits of each option relative to the needs of the Government and other stakeholders and provide recommendations on appropriate actions to mitigate significant impacts, when possible;
Identify potentially conflicting environmental requirements, identify options for resolution, research the risks and benefits of each option, and recommend solutions to resolve potential conflicts;
Assist the Government in ensuring that its decision to approve or disapprove the options under evaluation will be in full compliance with all appropriate environmental requirements;
Prepare the Government?s draft and final environmental documents pursuant to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act for Government approval; and

<SOLNBR>N688366IACERT
<RESPDATE>082906
<CONTACT>Robert Woolwine (904) 542-1063
<DESC>The Department of Defense (DoD) is seeking industry information regarding the development and monitoring of a DoD-wide Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program (IA WIP) voucher system in the implementation of DoD 8570.01-M, "The Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program Manual".  DoD 8570.01-M specifically establishes IA training, certification, and workforce management implementation requirements for the DoD.  DoD workforce working in IA positions are required to receive appropriate training and take and pass related industry recognized IA certification examinations.  It is estimated that approximately 80,000 vouchers will be required over the next four years.  The DoD would like to accomplish this effort through the use of a web-based system that would allow IA workforce members to register, obtain training, obtain testing vouchers, track member progress, etc electronically.  A draft statement of objectives is provided as an uploaded attached fil!  e. Please submit information indicating capability to provide this service.  Please include any existing contractual vehicles already in place (NAVSEA’s Seaport-e multiple award contracts; other DoD/Navy contracts; GSA schedules; etc) that could be used to procure these services by 30 Sep 2006 (only contracts/schedules for which these services are within scope).  Include socio-economic/business size information (including applicable NAICS code), to be used in the determination of procurement set-aside procedures, if any.  Please provide any standard commercial industry practices that you feel would be beneficial and could be incorporated into a resulting solicitation, for example, pricing structure/arrangements, terms and conditions, etc.  Of specific interest are suggestions regarding the relationship between (1) the development/monitoring of the certification tracking system and (2) the actual vouchers, including suggestions on the contract approach to best accomplish the eff!  ort.  For instance, do both need to be provided by the same vendor, or could one vendor develop/monitor the system while another vendor provides the vouchers?  All of this information will be used to determine the best approach to take, and may be used in the development of a solicitation.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). This is not a request for proposal and does not obligate the Government to award a contract. The Office of Grants and Training (G&T), Center for Domestic Preparedness is conducting an end-user functionality and efficacy assessment of technical decontamination corridor support (DCS) equipment to validate their employment and effectiveness when used by first responders in weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or other hazardous environments.

G&T’s  Center for Domestic Preparedness  (CDP) is inviting manufacturers to provide information on three types of DCS equipment: (1) technical decontamination spray-type equipment used in the physical or chemical process of deliberate decontamination of responders and their equipment using liquids/solutions; (2) portable decontamination showers designed to deliver water/decontamination solution at low pressure, low volume; (3) liquid decontamination containment devices intended for use in the decontamination corridor for decontamination of people and hand-carried items. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Authorized Equipment List (AEL) item numbers for this equipment are 8.2.6, 8.2.8, and 8.2.11, respectively. The requested information will be included in the DCS equipment market research, will provide available product information, and will provide support information for the CDP DCS focus group and assessment.

The intent of the user assessment program will be to provide the emergency response community with feedback on equipment based on utilization in scenarios that replicate, to the maximum extent possible, conditions that will be experienced in incident response. The results of the assessment will not yield a determination of what product is best, nor shall the CDP endorse any product or manufacturer.

The assessment will be performed at the CDP by evaluators from the emergency response population, representative of all disciplines of agencies and jurisdictions across the US. These evaluators will be actual users of the equipment in the field. The evaluators will be presented with specific scenarios and tasks to be carried out using the equipment as a responder wearing Class 1, 2 or 3  personal protective equipment (PPE).  The scenarios will be tailored so that evaluated criteria can be objectively and subjectively assessed by each evaluator. Some of the criteria could include capability, usability, affordability, deployability, and maintainability.

If you wish to provide information about your particular brand/product, please provide in electronic (MS Word) format, your company name, whether you are a manufacturer or a distributor, address, point of contact, telephone number, fax number, web address and e-mail address. Additionally, please provide any information available such as the adaptability of the equipment in hazardous environments while wearing Class 1, 2 or 3 PPE, reliability, maintainability, durability, environmental limits, safety reports, latest research, and new developments. Also, please include cost information such as initial costs, replacement parts, accessory options, available warranties, and transportation requirements. 

Do not send your piece of equipment. Selected equipment will be purchased from distributors/suppliers as the equipment is selected for the assessment.

Respond by 4:00 P.M. CST on Thursday, August 31, 2006.  Only written responses will be accepted.  Your response can be mailed to the Department of Homeland Security, Center for Domestic Preparedness, Attn:  Charlotte Laughlin, Contract Specialist, P. O. Box 5100, Anniston, AL;  or e-mail in MS Word, Excel or PDF format to charlotte.laughlin@dhs.gov; ella.chapman@dhs.gov  or fax to (256) 847-2323.

Request for Information (RFI)

Description
The Warner Robins Air Logistics Center Support Equipment Commodity Council (SECC) is conducting market research into potential cost savings associated with the purchase of remanufactured equipment items versus the procurement of new equipment items.  This acquisition strategy concept is for those items being maintained solely at the field level (ERRC=U) without the benefit of depot level repair.  The service life cycle of this equipment ranges from 5 to 20 years.  Many of these items are sent to DRMO even though they still have value and can be refurbished to ?like new? condition.  Considerations to be looked at are carcass transportation cost & turn in value at time of procurement of remanufactured item, field level ordering and service life of the remanufactured item.   Initial research indicates that this approach may be an attractive alternative to buying new equipment & cost 40-70% of what a new item would cost.     
Some examples are as follows:  Powered Construction Equipment, Tow Tractors, Trailers, Dollies, Maintenance Stands & Platforms, Test Stands, Maintenance Fixtures, Hoists, Slings, Cradles, Maintenance Stands, Hydraulic Jacks, Forklifts and Towbars. 
The SECC is interested in obtaining information from industry and academia relevant to the costs, schedule, benefits, trade-offs, in addition to the positive & negative aspects of 1) acquiring these types of items as remanufactured, or 2) initiating a depot level maintenance strategy in which the items are inducted for overhaul and returned in a like new condition.  Emphasis is placed on existing commercial capability.
The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to promote DoD Sustainment Transformation Initiatives.  SECC goals are to reduce material costs by 20%, reduce acquisition cycle times by 50% and increase material availability by 20%.  The SECC takes a strategic approach to acquisition by leveraging spend through an Enterprise-wide Acquisition Strategy to and apply and incorporate Commercial Best Practices to the AF business process. 
Please submit responses to the 542d Combat Sustainment Wing, 583 CBSS/GBMRC (Ralston), 380 Richard Ray Blvd, STE 104, Robins AFB, GA 31098-1638, NLT COB 20 September 2006. Data submissions may be via: Email attachment for unclassified data using MS Word or PDF Formats. 
Mark all proprietary information ?For Government Use Only?. 
This solicitation is for information and planning purposes only. This announcement must not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract based upon this Request for Information or otherwise pay for the information solicited.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Radionuclide Decontamination for Urban Transit Infrastructure
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Radionuclide Decontamination for Urban Transit Infrastructure 

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity for partnership and licensing of a new technology for selective and effective radionuclide decontamination of urban transit infrastructure. The technology encompasses several unique capabilities for the research and development of radionuclide decontamination. The new designs specifically address the requirements of high efficiency, rapid deployment and easy removal, features that are essential for the timely restoration of urban areas previously contaminated with radionuclides. In addition, the possibility exists to partner with LLNL and the Yerevan Scientific Research Institute (also known as “Plastpolymer”) in Armenia through the DOE Global Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (GIPP) program to develop coatings and other vehicles for the immobilization and removal of radioactive contaminants. The GIPP program aims to prevent proliferation through strong commercial development.

Background:  Typically, radionuclide decontamination agents have been developed and used in sterile, nuclear power environments. At LLNL, technologies have been developed to understand the chemical and physical properties of surfaces and deposits found in the urban environment pertaining to public transportation, and address interference, specificity and efficiency problems found in commercial nuclear decontamination agents. Researchers are designing more effective and selective decontamination agents for radionuclides specific to a particular environment in which it is dispersed. 

Description:	LLNL wishes to partner with industry to develop and commercialize decontamination agents for effective decontamination of radionuclides in urban infrastructure. In addition, LLNL wishes to partner with a US business, and Plastpolymer, through the GIPP program to identify and develop for commercial use the most effective agents and delivery matrices for either immobilization or removal. The development will address important issues including contact between agent and contaminant, desirable removal characteristics, and easily treated waste residuals. The delivery system or systems will be optimized for a variety of surface types, including metal and concrete, and must be capable of decontaminating both porous and non-porous surfaces, accessible and inaccessible sites, vertical and horizontal surfaces. 

Advantages: 
Features	
Effective and selective decontamination agents;	Delivery matrices designed for easy,rapid and effective decontamination; LLNL expertise in surface science, test facilities, and radionuclide research and decontamination.

Benefits
More efficient decontamination (less interference,lower operating costs, less waste generated; Reduce decontamination and restoration times; High profile research / business opportunity.

Potential Applications:  The new decontamination technology has applications in homeland security, environmental protection, the nuclear industry, and industrial-use radioisotope cleanup following accidental or intentional contamination with a radionuclide source. The decontamination technology may also be applicable to military needs. There are currently few options for decontamination agents and none specifically tailor delivery matrix characteristics of decontamination agents for several radionuclides in the urban environment.

Development Status: Experiments using a variety of analytical chemistry techniques have led to the improved understanding of urban environment surfaces. Preliminary designs of decontamination agents have been made and their performance has been theoretically predicted. Experimental studies of decontamination agents on urban surfaces contaminated with radionuclides are being performed to better understand the radionuclide/surface interactions and to improve the preliminary designs. Delivery matrix systems have been designed and developed at Plastpolymer, and other matrices will be tested at LLNL later this year. Patent protection is being pursued for novel aspects of the designs.

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's radionuclide decontamination technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

BAH developed the System and started Phase 3 to assist States with interfacing eDRS.  However, State interface has taken longer then expected and Phase 3 was not completed.  To date, 18 of the 52 States are actively transmitting/receiving data directly with the eDRS server; utilizing all of the established communication options.  The remaining States must be transitioned to eDRS by 12/31/06.  BAH has the System expertise required to bring up the other 34 States and is determined to be the most cost effective  and timely method to complete States' transition from the existing DRS to the new eDRS.  Qualified firms meeting these requirements must respond no later than August 29 to Leonard.Green@fns.usda.gov or via mail at 3101 Park Center Drive, Room 220, Alexandria, VA 22302.

The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. CCR Requirement - Company must be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award could be made to them. If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Consular Affairs Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation as a key component for overseas Consular interviewing booths and staff offices.  The Dell Optiplex GX520 SFF was selected for this purpose because of the results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. to replace a like number of older PCs used overseas in Consular interviewing booths and staff offices. The Dell Optiplex GX520 is only small form factor workstation that fully meets Consular needs, and was selected for the following reasons: 1)     It is a specific all-in-one configuration that includes three separate components: the Dell Optiplex GX520 small form factor workstation, a 19-inch Dell flat panel monitor, and a stand.  It occupies less than 1/3 of the space used by conventional mini-tower PCs deployed by the Bureau of Consular Affairs and eliminates overcrowding common to interviewing booths and visa issuance desks.  Moreover, the Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation provides additional space with an opening underneath the monitor that can be used for keyboard storage or to corral small office supplies. This space can be significantly useful to users with limited workspace.   2)       It is the only small form factor PC manufactured that combines the screen display, processor, and all other components in one compact unit, while still allowing the components to separate from each other.  This feature is useful when one piece of the all-in-one configuration is malfunctioning and must be replaced.      3)       The Dell Optiplex GX520 small form factor workstation complies with CA’s baseline standard for desktop PCs and is fully compatible with the Consular HW and SW environments. The following Consular Affairs overseas applications were tested for functionality: ACRS, ACS, ACS+, ST, CST_PWD, INK, IVO, and NIV. 4)       The Dell GX520 has BTX (balance technology extended) chassis, power supply, and motherboard that are designed for thermal efficiency providing improved reliability and quieter operation. Dell’s HyperCool thermal management technology uses variable speed fans that provide optimal cooling with less power and enables quieter operation. 5)       The workstation is a modular unit and uses industry standard components, which will decrease the amount of time needed service this workstation. The Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation offers a 2.8 GHz Pentium 4 processor, with an Intel 945G Express chipset. The Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation comes equipped with an 80 gigabyte SATA drive, and 512 MB of RAM. In summation, CA/CST believes that the Department’s best interests will be served if the Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation is procured at this time. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The Dell Optiplex GX520 All-In-One Chassis SFF workstation has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board FOB Destination CONUS

C.2.3  A military veterinarian or, in his absence, his trained representative, will be present at delivery and will inspect the caprines for diseases, contagious or non-contagious, and other unacceptable problems, e.g. lameness.

C.2.4 Examples of common causes for rejection are listed below (but are not all inclusive):

C.2.4.1  Mucopurulent Nasal discharge:  Mucopurulent nasal discharge is an indicator of upper respiratory infection or pneumonia.  A small amount of clear nasal discharge may result from transport.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-06-997 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 621511 and the business size standard is $11.5 M.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Fogarty International Center (FIC) is participating in the Diplomacy Fellows Program from the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).

Scope of Work

The Fogarty International Center (FIC) promotes and supports scientific research, training and capacity-building internationally to reduce disparities in global health.  To accomplish this broad objective, FIC works with the U.S. scientific community and counterparts abroad; U.S. agencies, including the State Department and other agencies of the Department of Health and Human Services; international organizations; and non-governmental groups.  FIC funds research, training and capacity building programs to advance critical initiatives on HIV/AIDS, emerging infectious diseases, medical informatics, maternal and child health, environmental health and other key issues, and supports multi-disciplinary research programs on topics such as the linkage between health status and economic development and international bioethics.

The AAAS administers the Science & Technology Policy Fellowships program in six areas to provide the opportunity for accomplished scientists and engineers to participate in and contribute to the public policymaking process of the Federal government.  The AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellowships enable competitively selected scientists and engineers to learn first hand about the use of science and technology in government decision making while offering valuable contributions of their knowledge and analytical skills to federal agencies and congressional offices.  Fellows bring fresh perspectives, new insights and extensive knowledge and education in a variety of disciplines, along with a desire to learn about policymaking that enables them to function at a high level from the start.

AAAS currently partners with nearly a dozen federal agencies, with congressional offices and committees, and with nearly 30 professional scientific societies to operate the AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellowships, which have been providing public policy education and outreach experiences for scientists and engineers for more than 30 years.  The AAAS Fellowships help to establish and nurture critical links between federal decision makers and scientific professionals to support public policy that benefits the wellbeing of the nation and the planet.  The result is a current network of more than 1,800 former Fellows who are more articulate and knowledgeable about conducting and communicating their science to support policy at national and international levels, and more effective in leadership roles in the public and policy arenas as well as in academia, industry and the non-profit sectors.

The overall goal of the AAAS Fellowships is to generate policy-savvy scientists and engineers, who can conduct research, teach, communicate, and apply their expertise within a policy context to better support international, federal, state and local policy efforts and the broader public.  The overarching aim is to increase the capacity of scientists to inform the discussions and decisions of individuals and institutions that influence or determine policies.

Current and future cohorts of Fellows create a growing network to increase outcomes and to mentor a new generation of leaders with the skills to communicate and apply science to enhance public understanding of technological issues and support improved policy.  This can happen through the education and outreach efforts of those who return to academia and teach undergraduates, graduates and post-docs, and by those who transition into government, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and industry and take leadership roles applying and communicating science.

AAAS recruits candidates from a broad array of backgrounds and a diversity of geographic, disciplinary, gender, and ethnic perspectives.  Fellows come from a range of sectors, including academia, industry and NGOs.

Building on more than 30 years of experience, AAAS organizes and manages the Science & Technology Policy Fellowships in consultation with program officers at the partnering agencies.  Implementation of the AAAS Fellowships involves five main areas of activity annually:  promotion and recruitment, selection and placement, financial support and services, professional development, and monitoring and reporting.

The AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellowships are extremely competitive, involving a formal, three-tier merit review and selection process.  The finalists are judged on their educational and professional credentials and references, demonstrated competence in a specific area of science or engineering, ability to communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, and leadership potential.  The focus is to select the best scientists and engineers from the applicant pool, as well as those whose experiences and interests fit with the mission of hosting agencies and offices.

The placement process involves interviews between finalists and partner agency potential host offices to explore compatibility between projects, expertise and interests.  This is followed by matching finalists with offices and issuing offer letters to confirm final assignments.

The AAAS Fellowships Department conducts a year-long professional development program that includes an eight-day orientation, monthly seminars, career-enhancement sessions, skill-building workshops, networking events, and an annual retreat.  The Fellowships Department also maintains a database and list servers, and coordinates alumni events that enable Fellows to interact and network during and beyond their fellowships.  The activities help to enhance the Fellows? knowledge and capabilities, and also to foster interaction and collaborative connections within and beyond the fellowship cohorts.

The FIC has participated in the past in the AAAS Diplomacy Fellows component of the program, which began in 1980 in the Department of State.  The FIC considers the program to be very significant in achieving its mission of training of future international policy makers.  The Fellow will work with a community of researchers, administrators and policy-makers at FIC, to advance medical research, training and capacity-building through international cooperation.  The Fellows will be placed in the Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies (DIEPS).  The Fellow will also contribute to program, policy, and priority-setting efforts.

The AAAS fellow will work in the DIEPS on issues related to the interpretation of genomic, epidemiology and immunology data integrated with mathematical models and economic data to provide a basis for policy in the control of infectious diseases.  The primary focus is on vaccine preventable diseases, diarrhea and enteric infections and malaria.  The work of DIEPS has contributed to the decision making process at multi-lateral organizations such as the WHO, World Bank and Unicef and helped to inform national policies in the U.S. and a number of other nations, especially in regard to the control of influenza.  The AAAS fellow will have the opportunity to work with DIEPS investigators to synthesize and write papers that are policy relevant in the field of international public health.  The fellow will also have the opportunity to travel and present the work at international forums.

AAAS in uniquely qualified to manage and administer the Science & Technology Policy Fellowships.  Established in 1848, it is the world?s largest federation of scientific and engineering societies, with some 120,000 members.  Its 260+ affiliated organizations span all fields of the biological and physical sciences, social sciences and engineering.  The Science & Technology Policy Fellowships have grown from one program with seven Fellows in 1973, to nearly a dozen current agency partnerships with annual cohorts of approximately 130 Fellows.  AAAS manages Science & Technology Policy Fellowships in six thematic program areas:

?	Congressional
?	Diplomacy
?	Energy, Environment & Natural Resources
?	Global Stewardship
?	Health, Education & Human Services
?	National Defense & Global Security

Over the past 33 years, AAAS Fellowships have earned an impressive reputation, attracting significant interest from talented scientists across the country.  AAAS currently receives more than 400 qualified applications annually for the approximately 85 fellowship slots that it administers across the six program areas (an additional 30 Congressional Fellows are selected via partner scientific societies).

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for one (1) each, Custom Active Vibration Control System to be used in the Manufacturing Metrology Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD. 

***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item(s):  

Line Item 0001 - The Contractor shall furnish one (1) each, Custom Active Vibration Control System

Background:
The NIST small force laboratory needs to enhance the vibration isolation of its one-of-a-kind electrostatic force balance (EFB). The goals for this isolation system in order of importance are 1) to reduce the known vibration levels in the frequencies between 5 Hz and 250 Hz and 2) to cancel the effects of transient vibration sources, such as laboratory floor vibrations that are produced by foot traffic in the laboratory.

Objective:
Reduce vibrations of the EFB instrument platform by a factor of five in the frequencies between 5 Hz and 250 Hz subject to the following technical constraints:

Objective must be accomplished working within the geometric constraints of our existing system (see drawings 1 and 2) and without compromising overall system performance at frequencies outside this bandwidth. Because the EFB is essentially a pendulum, the active vibration control system must not have low frequency vibrations that can adversely interact with its performance (e.g., a sub-hertz resonance in the isolation system is unacceptable). The ability of proposed systems to cope with moving payloads will be evaluated and will form part of the basis of technical evaluation.

*** The system shall meet or exceed the following technical specifications:

Vendor shall supply a vibration isolation system that creates an isolated pedestal that replaces our existing granite pier (drawing of granite pier is attached and is drawing number 1). 

The vibration isolation system shall be comprised of a granite pedestal and isolation mounts. The pedestal must have mounting surfaces with threaded holes that are identical with our existing pier, which has threaded holes on the top surface and one side as illustrated in drawing number 1).

Payload (see assembly drawing number 2): An optical table and instruments less than 400 lbs.

Dimensional constraints and tapped holes:  see drawing number 1, the height of the top surface of the granite pedestal with respect to the laboratory floor must be maintained at all times (including power failures). This top surface must be able to be leveled to within 0.5 milliradians, and the control system must not result in deviations from this leveled position by more than 0.5 milliradians.

Vibration control bandwidth: 0.6 Hz to 250 Hz

Target vibration requirement: less than 0.05 micrometers/second peak-to-peak vertical and horizontal vibrations across the control bandwidth as measured at any location on the granite block when isolating the above payload. At a minimum, vendor must demonstrate reduction of the broad seismic peak currently observed in the vertical acceleration response (drawing number 3) between 5 Hz and 250 Hz by a factor of five.

Moving payloads: small (less than 1 kg), low acceleration stage motions occur on the optical table on a regular basis. Vendors should provide evidence of their proposed systems? efficacy in the presence of such disturbances.  An ability to rapidly (less than 100 ms) restore equilibrium after such disturbances is highly desirable.

The granite pedestal serves as a stable platform on which we mount a vacuum isolated optical table that supports a host of precision measurement equipment. The proposed new system must conform to our existing fixtures. Threaded mounting holes, as shown on drawing number 1, are absolutely required at the indicated locations so that we can mount existing equipment and fixtures. The top surface of the vibration isolation pedestal must remain level, and the total height of the pedestal as measured from the laboratory floor to the top surface of the pedestal must not change when power fails (within 1 mm), control is turned off, etc.

Vendor shall supply technical support necessary to achieve the desired performance specification. For instance, a site visit may be arranged immediately upon contract award. The purpose of this site visit is to: 
1)	Acquaint vendor with layout of the existing system and to allow the vendor to visually inspect the existing system and to see first hand and review all critical dimensions with the NIST COTR.
2)	 Measure the vibration signature on the existing granite pier so that the vendor can observe the baseline vibration level that must be improved in order to demonstrate vibration isolation after the upgrade to the active vibration isolation system. 

Vendor shall provide a preliminary design after the initial site visit in order to clearly show how their design complies with the existing fixtures and geometric constraints. NIST approval of this design drawing must be secured before vendor proceeds with fabrication of the system.  Thus, a detailed, dimensioned schematic drawing is required to satisfy this preliminary design requirement. Vendors? quotations shall itemize the cost of providing this initial design as well as the estimated time to complete the initial design.

The quotation should include any electrical and mechanical requirements (e.g., instrument air) that NIST must provide for the proper functioning of the proposed isolation system.  NIST can provide standard instrument air and 120 Volt, AC power. Other options may be available, but vendor must coordinate with NIST. 

Design Review and Approval by the Government (Applicable to Line Item 0001)

The Contractor shall submit the appropriate designs/drawings to the Government prior to the commencement of the manufacturing effort.  The Government will review the documentation provided to ensure compliance with the specifications. Subsequent to this review, the Government will either approve the design or provide detailed comments as to any deficiencies.  Any additional effort, if required, by the vendor to meet the design requirements shall be considered to be within the scope of this Line Item.  Upon Government approval of the design, the vendor may commence the manufacturing phase of this contract. 

Approval by the Government as required above shall not relieve the Contractor of its obligation to comply with the specifications and with all other requirements of the contract, nor shall it impose upon the Government any liability it would not have had in the absence of such approval.




Installation:

Vendor will arrange to ship granite pedestal and isolation mounts to NIST. NIST will arrange for rigging of the pedestal into the NIST advanced measurement laboratory, Building 219, Room B0014. NIST will unpack the system and position the isolation mounts on the laboratory floor. NIST will supervise riggers as they remove the existing pedestal and replace it with the new vibration isolation system. 

After NIST completes initial setup and positioning, NIST will contact the vendor to arrange a mutually agreeable date, no later than 30 days after installation, for a site visit and acceptance testing. During the arranged site visit, the vendor will inspect the installation and approve the system setup. The vendor will then tune the vibration control system to demonstrate vibration control performance as described within the acceptance test and criteria. 

Documentation:

Vendor will provide two copies of a manual for the system. This manual may be a three ring binder or other type of bound document but must include the following: 1) A description of the system that includes a drawing and list of materials 2) All associated product manuals, cut sheets, etc for the components of the system 3) A single page that provides a list of all user selectable programming variables and their values that are recorded at the time of acceptance, 4) A general instruction manual that describes the technical function of the system and recommended practices for tuning and troubleshooting the system 5) Hard copies of vibration responses measured at three locations on the new granite pedestal . 

Acceptance test and criteria:

After the system is installed, NIST will place the balance components back on the optical table that rests atop the granite pedestal.  The vendor will tune the active vibration control and measure the vibrations on the granite pedestal at three locations in all three axes and demonstrate that the system reduces the peak vibration spectra.

At a minimum, vendor must demonstrate reduction of the broad seismic peak currently observed in the vertical acceleration response (drawing number 3) between 5 Hz and 100 Hz by a factor of five.

In FY 04, President Bush introduced the Access to Recovery Program (ATR) Grant, a SAMHSA treatment and recovery support initiative, offering those affected by the substance abuse opportunity to choose treatment and recovery services among community and faith based clinical treatment and recovery support service providers.

In FY 06, SAMHSA desires to continue it work with community and faith based organizations including ATR service provider organizations by providing capacity building and sustainability technical assistance and training to these groups.  I addition, SAMHSA desires to procure contractual services with organizations having specific expertise in providing technical assistance and training to grassroots faith and community organizations including ATR treatment and recovery provider organizations.

In FY 04, President Bush introduced the Access to Recovery Program (ATR) Grant, a SAMHSA treatment and recovery support initiative, offering those affected by the substance abuse opportunity to choose treatment and recovery services among community and faith based clinical treatment and recovery support service providers.

In FY 06, SAMHSA desires to continue it work with community and faith based organizations including ATR service provider organizations by providing capacity building and sustainability technical assistance and training to these groups.

Bush signed an Executive Order, expanding the 1996 Charitable Choice Legislation enacted under President Clinton?s Administration.  In FY 04, President Bush introduced the Access to Recovery Program (ATR) Grant, a SAMHSA treatment and recovery support initiative, offering those affected by the substance abuse opportunity to choose treatment and recovery services among community and faith based clinical treatment and recovery support service providers.

In FY 06, SAMHSA desires to continue it work with community and faith based organizations including ATR service provider organizations by providing capacity building and sustainability technical assistance and training to these groups.  I addition, SAMHSA desires to procure contractual services with organizations having specific expertise in providing technical assistance and training to grassroots faith and community organizations including ATR treatment and recovery provider organizations. 

Geographical designations are specified.  For this particular requisition, the contractor must agree to provide technical assistance and training to faith and community organization including ATR treatment and recovery providers in the state of Texas and Louisiana.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), requires a contractor to provide professional services for the following:

Background

Alcohol and other drug abuse and mental health problems are among society?s most pervasive medical and social concerns.  Individuals, families, and local communities continue to be seriously affected by substance abuse and mental health challenges. Historically, grassroots faith and community organizations have responded to these issues operating on shoestring budgets and without federal, local and state support.  Since 1992, SAMHSA has actively engaged and supported faith-based and community organizations involved in substance abuse and mental health services.  In January 2001, President George W. Bush signed an Executive Order, expanding the 1996 Charitable Choice Legislation enacted under President Clinton?s Administration.  In FY 04, President Bush introduced the Access to Recovery Program (ATR) Grant, a SAMHSA treatment and recovery support initiative, offering those affected by the substance abuse opportunity to choose treatment and recovery services among community and faith based clinical treatment and recovery support service providers.

In FY 06, SAMHSA desires to continue it work with community and faith based organizations including ATR service provider organizations by providing capacity building and sustainability technical assistance and training to these groups.  I addition, SAMHSA desires to procure contractual services with organizations having specific expertise in providing technical assistance and training to grassroots faith and community organizations including ATR treatment and recovery provider organizations. 

Geographical designations are specified.  For this particular requisition, the contractor must agree to provide technical assistance and training to faith and community organization including ATR treatment and recovery providers in the state of Missouri.

1.0	Background 

The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates a fleet of twenty-one (21) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are operated differently from general aviation; Coast Guard HU-25 missions frequently operate at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments.  This environment accelerates corrosion on airframe structures and components of the aircraft.  The Coast Guard typically flies each of these aircraft 800 flight hours per year.  Aircraft are inspected in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacture?s (OEM) periodic requirements in conjunction with the Coast Guard?s specialized Aircraft Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  Historically, corrosion damage and operational wear and tear associated with aging aircraft is revealed, which is often outside the scope of OEM published repair limits and specifications.  All Coast Guard horizontal stabilizers are serial number tracked under ACMS.  This tracking provides a historical record of repair, item location and status.  It also provides an effective method of configuration control.  
2.0	Objective		
The Coast Guard?s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center or equivalent, to effectively repair HU-25 horizontal stabilizers, Part Numbers MY20331-16 and MY20331-17.  Repaired horizontal stabilizers must meet the OEM current specifications, critical profile and dimensions to ensure the fit to aircraft with minimal adjustment during installation.  The Coast Guard requires a Turn-Around-Time of 120 days from time of material receipt at prospective contractor facility in order to prevent Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) delay in aircraft delivery.  During repair, corrosion preventative steps shall be incorporated.  The horizontal stabilizer must also be painted to match the Coast Guard?s current colors and paint schemes. 
The Coast Guard anticipates at least two levels of repair for horizontal stabilizers.  First, a ?return-to-service repair? would be required for horizontals that are subject to limited damage, such as exterior corrosion or minor impact damage, inspection and replacement of bushings and hardware as required. This would require skin repair and hardware.  Second, ?extensive repair? would be required for horizontal stablizers that require replacement of skins, major extrusions, and fittings. At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the prospective contractor technical and price proposal.  Prospective contractor may propose additional levels of service.

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

The Naval Air Depot (NADEP), Jacksonville has a requirement for software development in the area of Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) analysis.  This task requires the update of the Integrated Reliability Centered Maintenance System (IRCMS) to support integration of RCM analysis data with the In-service Sustained Maintenance Planning (ISMP) database and EBM scheduling tool for the E-6 aircraft and to still provide usability across NAVAIR programs. The complete Performance Work Statement, Performance Standards Matrix, Contract Data Requirements List (DD1423) and Contract Line Items are available via the Internet at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/. 
Contract Line Items (CLINs) 0003 - 0005 are separately priced Contract Data Requirements List (CDRLs). These separate deliverables need to be proposed separately under the assigned CLINs. The Government reserves the right to determine if they will procure these separately priced deliverables during the proposal evaluation process.

<SUBJECT>69--This is the third amendment to the combined synopsis/solicitation for RSATS range, Okinawa, Japan, solicitation number W52H09-06-R-0509.
<SOLNBR>W52H09-06-R-0509
<RESPDATE>082306
<ARCHDATE>10222006
<CONTACT>Gregory K. Johnson, (309) 782-5851
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post additional questions and answers in response to the original synopsis/solicitation for the RSATS range, Okinawa, Japan. 3.5.2 The system is going to require an air compressor as well as an air dryer, air coole r, oil remover, and fine particulate filter.  Is there a location up range that this can be located as well as a shed to install it in?   There will also need to be several spare parts as well as tools that belong to the contractor that will need to be lef t on site for maintenance and warranty reasons.  Will there be a secure location on site to store these items or will the contractor need to supply a connex type storage box? Answer: There will be a secure location on site available for the storage of sp are parts. However, any items necessary for the day-to-day operations of the range requiring secure storage shall be stored in a container or shed provided by the contractor. This range will be portable and the storage unit provided by the contractor shall  be portable as well.          3.7. Determining warranty terms for these types of systems are a difficult task to deal with.  The time frame for the life of the target system can not be based on a specific time, rather the number of cycles the system perfo rms.  How many cycles can you expect to have on the system in a week, month, year?  If the cycle warranty is 500,000, how much training is being done each day to reach that amount of cycles?  It is realistic to have the cycle warranty be reached long befor e the term warranty is reached depending on how much training is being done? Answer: Cycles on this range are an unknown quantity at this time. Therefore, the warranty must be based on time.          3.12.1. Is there any leeway on the 14 days of site acces s?  The installation should be complete in that time frame; the only variable would be delays that are out of the contractors hands.  Such delays could be weather related, and freight related. In relation to the site, is there going to be concrete for the TD to perch on?  Will the contractor be able to pour concrete for the TD to perch on?  Will the site be prepped for the contractor, or is that the contractors responsibility? Answer: Yes, there is leeway on the 14 day period. A firm installation schedule will be negotiated at time of award and freight and/or weather delays will be taken into account. There will be no concrete for the TD and the contractor shall not pour concrete. The range shall be installed on the flat ground surface as is with no additio nal site preparation.
