Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.  The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside).  Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s).
Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. 
22.	UID:  If unit price exceeds $5,000.00 then UID requirements will apply.

<DESC><p>Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is issuing solicitation number SPE4AX-17-R-TL23 in reference to the H-60 Performance Based Supply Chain Management holistic project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>SPE4AX-17-R-TL23 is issued to add approximately 1,271 NSNs to the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC) long term contract (LTC) as a separate performance-based support subsumable contract with metrics and incentives/disincentives tied to achieving improved customer outcomes. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This holistic project will also include approximately 905 SAC sole source items either currently on the LTC or being added to the LTC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The whole scope of the holistic project includes a total of approximately 2,176 NSNs that will be managed on the subsumable contract action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, this project contains backup spot-buy support for a population of 495 competitive items (spreadsheet titled 3A) on which SAC will perform analysis to ensure that DLA does not encounter gaps in support.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, for this population of items, if a gap is identified, SAC may be asked to fill the gap quantity through a spot-buy until the DLA supply chain delivers.</p>
<p>This population of items meets the definition of bundling at FAR 2.101, and it is likely unsuitable for award to a small business due to the diversity, size, or specialized nature of the elements of the performance specified.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>DLA has determined that measurably substantial benefits are expected to be derived as a result of the bundling as defined at FAR 7.107.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The expected benefits of this bundling action are listed in FAR 7.107-3 and summarized below:</p>
<p>(1) Cost savings</p>
<p>(2) Price reduction</p>
<p>(3) Quality improvements that will save time or improve or enhance performance or efficiency</p>
<p>(4) Reduction in acquisition cycle times</p>
<p>(5) Better terms and conditions</p>
<p>(6) Anticipated financial benefits equivalent to five (5) percent of the estimated contract or order value (including options)</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to SAC; therefore, if any source is interested in this requirement, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date and submit a complete response on how the offeror would provide holistic support for this population of NSNs to support the H-60 including a complete response to the Government Sources Sought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and Small Business Administration Procurement Center Representative (SBA PCR), <a href="mailto:michael.massello@sba.gov">michael.massello@sba.gov</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government may alter the acquisition strategy if sufficient information is received on how another offeror can provide holistic support for this population of items to provide the desired customer outcomes.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Spectro Analytical Instruments Inc. located at 91 Mckee Drive, Mahwah, NJ 07430-2105, to purchase an agreement for the service and maintenance of one (1) ARCOS (Model) inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) (S/N 128163/09) to ensure uninterrupted performance within manufacturer's specifications on a scheduled and as-needed basis.
<p>The Inorganic Measurement Science Group (IMSG), in the Chemical Sciences Division at NIST, relies heavily on ICP instrumentation in order to validate methodologies as well as certify reference materials for use in the marketplace. Therefore, it is essential that the instruments are well maintained so as not to delay progress or risk introducing measurement error.</p>
<p>Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) parts are required for any repairs. Market research revealed that Spectro Analytical Instruments Inc. is the only manufacturer of replacement parts and software updates for the ARCOS ICP and sole supplier of OEM certified technicians that can maintain and repair the ICP. This conclusion is supported by a letter from the vendor attesting to this fact.</p>
<p>As such, Spectro Analytical Instruments Inc. is determined to be the only source reasonably available to this requirement.</p>
<p>The resulting purchase order will be a Firm Fixed Price purchase order consisting of a one-year base period and four one-year option periods. The NAICS Code is 811219 with a size standard of $20.5M in annual receipts.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties who regard themselves as capable of fulfilling these requirements are invited to submit responses to the Government for consideration. Responses received by 9:00 am ET on 6/26/2017, will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP). THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) NO. NIH-NINDS-17-05, ENTITLED: "DRUG MANUFACTURING AND FORMULATION PROGRAM (DMFP)" WILL BE ISSUED VIA FEDBIZOPPS ON OR ABOUT JULY 12, 2017.
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to re-open and solicit new offers under the NIH's Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network (BPN) contract program for manufacturing and formulation services of dosage forms of small molecule drug candidates to be used in preclinical and clinical studies for neurological disease disorders.</p>
<p>In January 2015, the NINDS made two 10-year IDIQ contract awards to Albany Molecular Research Inc., Albany, New York and MRIGlobal, Kansas City, Missouri under its Drug Manufacturing and Formulation Program. These are the only two organizations currently under the DMFP contract program. NINDS has a need to increase the competition pool under this program and the plan to re-issue the exact RFP requirements originally advertised and competed back in 2014. This requirement was originally advertised for a 10-year order period, with a maximum of $50.9 million and a minimum of $25,000. These minimums and maximums are still applicable to any new award(s). The order period under any new award(s) will be from the time of the award through the end of the program's current ordering period, January 14, 2025.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awarding multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts under this solicitation.</p>
<p>The NIH established the Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network (BPN) to bridge the gap in drug development between academic and industry research (http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/dpdrugs/index.htm). The BPN supports, through grants and contracts, every step of the drug development process from validated hits through Phase I clinical trials. The Drug Manufacturing and Formulation Program (DMFP), a component of the BPN, will conduct the development and manufacture of dosage forms of small molecule drug candidates suitable for administration in preclinical efficacy studies, Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies, and clinical trials. Contractors will conduct process development and preparation of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), pre-formulation and formulation studies, analytical method development and validation, stability studies, drug product manufacturing, packaging, storage, and distribution of the drug products. The work will be conducted in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (cGMPs) and as appropriate Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. Data and documentation will be prepared for example CMC regulatory documents in a form acceptable to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for inclusion in a Drug Master File (DMF), IND application, or New Drug Application (NDA). Demonstrate the capability to perform the required work in-house, rather than through subcontractors.</p>
<p>The design of the DMFP is to provide neuroscientists with drug manufacture and drug formulation services for the development of candidate molecules suitable for administration in preclinical efficacy studies, Investigational New Drug enabling studies, and clinical trials. The work of the Contractor will be divided into Performance Activities. In general, each candidate compound brought to the Contractor will include any or all of the following activities listed in the Statement of Work Attachment to this notice. The ultimate goal of the Blueprint program and of individual manufacturing projects is to bring new drugs to market. To this end, the NIH has approved a Declaration of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) for this contract. The DEC enables the Contributors to retain control of the intellectual property for compounds created through the DMFP.</p>
<p>This is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP). This is a PRE-SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. A Request for Proposals (RFP) No. NIH-NINDS-17-05, entitled, "Drug Manufacturing and Formulation Program (DMFP)" will be available electronically on or about July 12, 2017 and may be accessed only through the FedBizOpps website (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov). OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINELY CHECKING THE FEDBIZOPPS WEBSITE FOR ANY POSSIBLE SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED. NO INDIVIDUAL NOTIFICATION OF ANY AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<p>The Contractors shall deliver Booster Fin Kits in accordance with specific, individually written delivery orders issued by NSWC IHEODTD within the scope of the applicable Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
<p>The Government intends to make a multiple award resulting from the solicitation to the responsible offerors whose submissions, which comply with the instructions and conform to the solicitation, will be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. Best value will be determined based on an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors for award. The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers: (FACTOR 1) technical capability based on examination of facilities, manufacturing process, quality assurance plan, and management and schedule; (FACTOR 2) Past Performance (see FAR 52.212-1(b)(10)); and (FACTOR 3) Cost. These factors are listed in descending order of importance. All non-cost factors, when combined, are more important than cost; however, cost becomes more of a deciding factor of importance when offerors receive similar ratings for the other factors. General statements, that the offeror can or will comply with the requirements, that standard procedures will be used, that well known techniques will be used, or that paraphrases the RFP's specifications in whole or in part, will not constitute compliance with the mandatory requirements concerning the content of the technical proposal.</p>

This synopsis is being posted to Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at https://www.fbo.gov/.

<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk, Philadelphia Office intends to acquire support services, in accordance with 10 U.S.C.2304(c) (1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. A cost plus fixed fee sole source modification to current contract N0018917CZ026 with National Security Innovations (NSI), Inc. is anticipated to satisfy this requirement. The proposed acquisition will consist of additional contractor support services for Joint Staff Directorate (JS) J-39 Washington DC for JSs Strategic Multi-Layer Assessments (SMAs). SMAs are analytical studies performed for the Combatant Commands (COCOMS) regarding complex operational imperatives requiring multi-agency, multi-disciplinary solutions outside of core Service/Agency competency.
 The support provided under the contract consists broadly of mission analyses, qualitative and quantitative analyses, interagency politico-military war gaming and simulations to assess near and long term geo-political trends, identify indicators, and scope out options to achieve strategic and operational goals through analytic, technical, managerial and administrative support to enhance the SMA mission. Additional requirements have emerged that will require an increase in contractor man-hours under the existing contracted SMA support, and the government intends to modify the existing contract to implement these changes. The anticipated period of performance for this action will be 01 August 2017 through 27 March 2018.
 This is a supplemental requirement within the scope of work currently being performed by NSI under contract N0018917CZ026. The proposed acquisition is for services which the Navy intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.

Contractor: Building Momentum, LLC<br />16. Description: Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC), Deputy Commandant, Installations and Logistics (DC I&amp;L) Expeditionary Logistics Division requires support for the training, equipment, online resource development and community facilitation support for the Marine Maker Initiative. This initiative began in 2016, as part of the 2015 Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) Implementation Plan for Additive Manufacturing. This particular initiative focuses on workforce development of digital design and manufacturing technologies. This contract provides support to the Marine Maker Initiative, and is intended to enable Marines with the training and tools necessary to better develop tactical solutions to problems. This initiative includes four different types of training in various locations both CONUS and OCONUS, online training and resource development, refinement of the digital collaboration website, and purchasing of equipment to include 3D Manufacturing Kits, Fabrication Kits, Robotics Kits, and Electronics Kits. The performance period for this contract is anticipated to have a one-year base period with two (2) one-year option periods.</p>
<p>The requirement will be fulfilled through a firm fixed price contract. The NAICS is 611430; Small Business Size is $11M.</p>
<p>This procurement is a commercial acquisition using FAR Subpart 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items.</p>
<p>17. Place of Contract Performance: Performance will be at the Contractor's Facilities. Travel is required to support the training events held at DoD Facilities both CONUS / OCONUS.</p>
<p>18. Set-Aside Status: This is a sole-source direct award to a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) IAW FAR 19.1406 and FAR 6.302-5(b)(6).</p>
<p>19. Rationale for Small Business strategy: After reviewing the results of a Market Survey, MCICOM identified one SDVOSB capable of fulfilling the requirement in its entirety.</p>
<p>FAR 19.203(c) states that the contracting officer shall first consider an acquisition for the small business socioeconomic contracting programs before considering a small business set-aside. This is further echoed in FAR 19.1406 (a), which states that a contracting officer shall consider a contract award to an SDVOSB concern on a sole source basis before considering small business set-asides.</p>
<p>While there are other small businesses that may be interested in fulfilling this requirement, in accordance with FAR 19.203 (Relationship among Small Business Programs), there is no order of preference among the various socioeconomic contracting programs. The Government should consider the market research and agency progress in fulfilling small business goals in making its decision on which program to utilize. The Government has taken both of those aspects into consideration in its decision to utilize the authority prescribed at FAR 19.1406 to contract directly with an SDVOSB for this requirement. The Small Business Specialist concurred with this determination on 22 June 2017.</p>

<p><br />The requirements of this acquisition are to manufacture and deliver LINK end items to use for the IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) Program in support of Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) activities; provide engineering, software, and logistical efforts as required to develop and incorporate LINK problem fixes and obsolescent part replacements; provide repair and replace support for the system; provide spares, Technical Data Package (TDP) updates, documentation updates, support Modification Work Order (MWO)/Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) activities, and the conduct of a Physical Configuration Audit (PCA). This effort also requires the support of PAC-3/MSE processing ground equipment and testing and perform PAC-3/MSE post-test missile performance analysis.&nbsp; The anticipated contract period of performance will be for five years from contract award.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional acquisition programs that focus primarily on the development of a single system or platform, the Army IAMD (AIAMD) Program is uniquely structured to enable the development of an overarching System of Systems (SoS) capability with all participating Army Air Defense components functioning interdependently to provide total-operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems. The AIAMD program achieves this objective by establishing the AIAMD architecture and developing the IBCS that provides Engagement Operations Centers (EOCs) implementing common integrated fire control capability for fire control connectivity enabling distributed operations, and the common Plug and Fight (P&amp;F) B-Kits located on the EOCs. The IFCN Relays network enable existing sensor components and weapon components with IBCS. P&amp;F A-Kits are developed and integrated on the various Component Acquisition Program (CAP) weapon and sensor Major End Items (MEI) and are interfaced to IBCS, which implements the overarching IAMD SoS integrated fire control capability. The Launcher Interface Network Kit (LINK) is a Launcher Action Message (LAM) / Launcher Response Message (LRM) translator box, which connects PATRIOT launchers (PAC-2/PAC-3 variants) to the IBCS network via the IFCN Relay or the IBCS EOC.</p>
<p>The Government has a LINK TDP and the Software End Item (executable) for this effort. The TDP and SW Executable can be provided as Government Furnished Information (GFI).</p>
<p>The responses shall address:</p>
<p>&bull; SHORT PRODUCTION LEAD TIME. Conceptual approach, estimated engineering, requalification and manufacturing lead times, key Government Furnished Property needed, driving assumptions and risks associated with the production starting May 2019.</p>
<p>&bull; MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES. Address the capacity, location, and status of the manufacturing capability for the identified NDI solution (e.g., are the NDI subsystem currently. Identify the customers who have purchased the identified NDI solution.)</p>
<p>All responses shall be submitted to the U.S. Army Contracting command, ATTN: CCAM-SM-A/Pamela R. Russell/Nicholas B. Kirby, Building 5250, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5280 or email <a href="mailto:pamela.r.russell.civ@mail.mil/nicholas.b.kirby.civ@mail.mil">pamela.r.russell</a><a href="mailto:pamela.r.russell.civ@mail.mil">.civ@mail.mil</a>/nicholas.b.kirby.civ@mail.mil.&nbsp;Written responses&nbsp;shall be received&nbsp;by 1500 CDT&nbsp;on the day this RFI closes. All questions and comments must be in writing (electronic email responses are acceptable), and no telephone calls will be accepted. The submission of this information is for planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any items, nor does the U.S. Army intend to award on the basis of this request for sources sought or otherwise pay for the information solicited.</p>

<p>AFFARS 5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (JUN 2016)</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the Center/MAJCOM/DRU or AFISRA ombudsmen,</p>
<p>James Anderson<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-9018<br />email: james.anderson@us.af.mil</p>
<p>Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the Center/MAJCOM/DRU or AFISRA level, may be brought by the interested party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (571) 256-2397, facsimile number (571) 256-2431.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>

<RESPDATE>071117
<ARCHDATE>07262017
<CONTACT>Nedzesky, Kathleen
<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) intends to award a purchase order, on a sole source basis, to Astrix Software Technology, Inc. (Astrix) to procure BIOVIA Materials Studio Software Licenses.  This is considered a sole source to Astrix because, to the best of the NETL's knowledge and based on market research conducted, Astrix is the only known source that can provide these software licenses to the federal Government.  In addition, replacing this software with another brand would have broad sweeping consequences with significant costs; underlying data structures and infrastructure changes may be needed; migration of data to a new tool/structure would need to be planned and could result in a loss of service and further exploitation; users may need additional training on the new product; technical resources to support the new tool may be required; additional hardware may be needed; and the decommission of the current product could be costly.  No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy  NETL's requirement.

This notice of intent is not a request for quote/proposal.  Any interested party that believes it is capable of meeting the NETL requirement described herein may identify themselves and must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill the requirement being requested by 9:00 AM ET on July 11, 2017.  Responses must be submitted in writing to kathleen.nedzesky@netl.doe.gov no later than the time and date noted above. Telephone responses and requests will not be received.

A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Appendix C

VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE FOR INCLUSION INTO CONTRACTS, AS APPROPRIATE

1. GENERAL

Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

2. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS

a. A contractor/subcontrator shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.

b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information.

The Office for Operations,
Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.

c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a
Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.

d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.

a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data
- General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).

b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor s information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling  must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA s information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA s sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct onsite inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.

d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies.

e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.

f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.

g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.

h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.

If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.

l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COR.
4. INFORMATION SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT

a. Information systems that are designed or developed for or on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities shall comply with all VA directives developed in accordance with FISMA, HIPAA, NIST, and related VA security and privacy control requirements for Federal information systems.

This includes, but is not limited to workarounds, patches, hotfixes, upgrades, and any physical components (hereafter referred to as Security Fixes) which may be necessary to fix all security vulnerabilities published or known to the vendor anywhere in the Systems, including Operating Systems and firmware. The vendor shall ensure that Security Fixes shall not negatively impact the Systems.

j. The vendor shall notify VA within 24 hours of the discovery or disclosure of successful exploits of the vulnerability which can compromise the security of the Systems (including the confidentiality or integrity of its data and operations, or the availability of the system). Such issues shall be remediated as quickly as is practical, but in no event longer than ____ days.

k. When the Security Fixes involve installing third party patches (such as Microsoft OS patches or Adobe Acrobat), the vendor will provide written notice to the VA that the patch has been validated as not affecting the Systems within 10 working days. When the vendor is responsible for operations or maintenance of the Systems, they shall apply the Security Fixes within ____ days.

l. All other vulnerabilities shall be remediated as specified in this paragraph in a timely manner based on risk, but within 60 days of discovery or disclosure. Exceptions to this paragraph (e.g. for the convenience of VA) shall only be granted with approval of the contracting officer and the VA Assistant Secretary for Office of Information and Technology.

5. INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE
 a. For information systems that are hosted, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities, contractors/subcontractors are fully responsible and accountable for ensuring compliance with all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and privacy directives and handbooks. This includes conducting compliant risk assessments, routine vulnerability scanning, system patching and change management procedures, and the completion of an acceptable contingency plan for each system. The contractor s security control procedures must be equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems. A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COTR and approved by VA Privacy Service prior to operational approval. All external Internet connections to VA s network involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation.

 b. Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA. These security controls are to be assessed and stated within the PIA and if these controls are determined not to be in place, or inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior to the collection of PII.

 c. Outsourcing (contractor facility, contractor equipment or contractor staff) of systems or network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires certification and accreditation (authorization) (C&A) of the contractor s systems in accordance with VA Handbook 6500.3, Certification and Accreditation and/or the VA OCS Certification Program Office. Government-owned (government facility or government equipment) contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require memorandums
of understanding and interconnection agreements (MOU-ISA) which detail what data types are shared, who has access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems connected to VA networks.

 d. The contractor/subcontractor s system must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update the PIA. Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA contracting officer and the ISO for entry into VA s POA&M management process. The contractor/subcontractor must use VA s POA&M process to document planned remedial actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices, and the completion of those activities. Security deficiencies must be corrected within the timeframes approved by the government. Contractor/subcontractor procedures are subject to periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials, including the VA Office of Inspector General. The physical security aspects associated with contractor/subcontractor activities must also be subject to such assessments. If major changes to the system occur that may affect the privacy or security of the data or the system, the C&A of the system may need to be reviewed, retested and re-authorized per VA Handbook 6500.3. This may require reviewing and updating all of the documentation (PIA, System Security Plan, Contingency Plan). The Certification Program Office can provide guidance on whether a new C&A would be necessary.

 e. The contractor/subcontractor must conduct an annual self-assessment on all systems and outsourced services as required. Both hard copy and electronic copies of the assessment must be provided to the COTR. The government reserves the right to conduct such an assessment using government personnel or another contractor/subcontractor. The contractor/subcontractor must take appropriate and timely action (this can be specified in the contract) to correct or mitigate any weaknesses discovered during such testing, generally at no additional cost.

 f. VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or contractor/subcontractor owned equipment or software on VA s network. If non-VA owned equipment must be used to fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, SOW or contract. All of the security controls required for government furnished equipment (GFE) must be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the equipment. All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV) software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VA approved configuration. Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and patches. Owners of approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral software and the firewall on the non-VA owned OE.

 g. All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor/subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the contractors/subcontractors that
contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract. 

 h. Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are:
  (1) Vendor must accept the system without the drive; 
  (2) VA s initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive    which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-   in; or
  (3) VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable    open  market replacement cost at time of purchase.

 (4) Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;
 (a) The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being  traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the  system are being returned physically intact; and
 
 (b) Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized  to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system  operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is  recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting
 technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications  need to be preapproved and described in the purchase order or contract.

 (c) A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that  states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls  above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.

6. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

a. The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor s notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.

c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.

d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.

7. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH

 a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.

 b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a  security incident  as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.

c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:

 (1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
 (2) Description of the event, including:
  (a) date of occurrence;
  (b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name,    social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability  code;
 (3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
 (4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
 (5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed  data    in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
 (6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
 (7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been  compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
 (8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information
 (9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
 (10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management  of   Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
 (11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in  avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive  personal information that may have been compromised.

d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $______ per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:

 (1) Notification;
 (2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily  monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
 (3) Data breach analysis;
 (4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud  alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to  resolution;
 (5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0  deductible; and
 (6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or  damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.

8. SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING

On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With a 10 working-day notice at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.

9. TRAINING

a. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA
information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:
 (1) Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically)  understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and  information systems;
 (2) Successfully complete the VA Cyber Security Awareness and Rules of  Behavior training and annually complete required security training;
 (3) Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually  complete required privacy training; and
 (4) Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training,  as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) Innovation Centre, 2300 McKenzie Ave, Victoria, BC Canda, for Oceans 2.0 hardware, software, and support for the Office of Ocean Exploration and Research in Silver Spring, MD.
<p><br />Background<br />The NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer is uniquely equipped with a high bandwidth satellite connection and a suite of collaboration tool referred to as telepresence technology . NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration and Research (OER) leverages this technology to capitalize on a worldwide team of volunteer researchers operating on shore while the ship is at sea to provide a multidisciplinary team to explore the deep ocean. The shore based scientists advise the ship'screw about expedition planning and provide scientific observations especially in form of organism identification and other annotations of underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) video . It is imperative that OER capture these observations in real time in an indexed and searchable database. The current means of collecting data is inadequate. The upgraded system and new features must be in place before 2017 or NOAA will lose valuable data and OER's mission to provide the highest quality of baseline data to the nation will be compromised.</p>
<p>To ensure NOAA collects the highest quality of data during Okeanos Explorer Expeditions OER requires an integrated data collection, database system that also provides post cruise data access capabilities. This system must be web based and capable of being accessed from numerous geographical locations simultaneously. The Oceans 2.0 software and hardware suite enables users to interact with massive video datasets composed of numerous data types and provide a real time and post cruise annotation capability and is the only solution on the market worldwide that can provide all these services and be ready for field deployment on board the Okeanos Explorer before 2017. This state of the art software and hard ware will allow the data collection team aboard NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer to interact with massive video datasets composed of numerous data types and provide a real time and post cruise annotation capability onboard and onshore in respect to the video data collected .</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification<br />ONC is a not-for profit organization, established by the University of Victoria to manage and enhance the VENUS and NEPTUNE observatories. VENUS and NEPTUNE represent over $200M in capital investment, and support transformative, multidisciplinary research in coastal and deep ocean environments whose applications shed light on ocean processes and their impacts on a global scale. Since its inception, ONC has also expanded to include observatories in the Arctic Ocean, expanded systems along the west coast of Canada, community volunteer ship data collection systems, coastal radars, ferry-based observations, and autonomous systems.</p>
<p>A key aspect of ONC that stands out from other systems operating today is the sophisticated interface for users (Oceans 2.0), including the ability to interact with specific instruments, download data in a variety of formats, explore visual and acoustic data sets, and create a variety of plots and images.</p>
<p>Oceans 2.0 features data and information for the public, scientists and educators. Users access ONC using the Oceans 2.0 data management and archive system over the Internet using a web portal, web services, or pre-programmed retrievals. The three main components of Oceans 2.0 include (i) Seascribe - a web based real-time annotation system, (ii) SeaTube - a web based video delivery, post cruise annotation system and (iii) Several plotting and visualizations tools to plot oceanographic data collected during ROV expeditions. Although built originally for observatories, the use of these tools has been successfully expanded to ship based operations. Being web-based, these tools are especially useful for telepresence enabled expeditions, similar to NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer, where most of data users (public and scientists) are based on shore.</p>
<p>Oceans 2.0 provides the capability for the 24/7 acquisition of high volumes of extremely diverse data, data quality control and calibration, storage, visualization and access by a global audience, as well as providing a convenient interface to handle otherwise complex tasks associated with the remote monitoring and control of the ROV operations. Oceans 2.0 is able to manage the vast amount of data produced, and users can mine the live and archived data streams, to detect trends, classify content and extract features, feeding the results back into the master database, thereby turning raw data into usable information and setting the stage to allow the information to be transformed into knowledge.</p>
<p>There are no alternative sources for this software. This software is proprietary to ONC and no other software can perform the specialized functions extensively tailored to video data analysis that are configured for distributed web based access and hardened for at sea operations. No other company can make modifications to the software or offer subscription services for this proprietary software<br />package.</p>
<p>Sources Sought<br />This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive offers and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the required hardware, software, and support may submit substantiating documentation in writing within five days of this notice. Responses can be sent via e-mail to shelley.smith@noaa.gov. Documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>NASA OPPORTUNITY NOTICE TO PARTICIPATE IN ITS CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES PROGRAM AS AN ALLIED ORGANIZATION
<p>This Opportunity Notice (hereinafter NOTICE) is for informational/planning purposes only and the Government will not pay for the information received. This NOTICE is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the government to enter into any agreement or other obligation or to conduct a prize competition.</p>
<p>This NOTICE is issued in accordance with the NASA Prize Authority, 51 U.S.C. 20144.</p>
<p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>New concepts for NASA prize competitions are sought for the Space Technology Mission Directorates Centennial Challenges Program, NASA's flagship program for technology prize competitions. NASA anticipates the ability now and beyond, to initiate several new technology prize competitions (hereinafter Challenges). Through this NOTICE, NASA seeks to identify potential partner organizations (hereinafter Allied Organizations) and concepts for Challenge competitions they are interested in conducting (Challenge Concept).</p>
<p>NASA will provide the monetary prize purse that is awarded to competition winners. NASA will not provide any funds or cost reimbursement to an Allied Organization for their work on a Challenge. Allied Organizations may administer a Challenge with their own funding or they may acquire the funding from other parties.</p>
<p>Organizations interested in becoming an Allied Organization should submit a proposal describing the specific area of interest and the technology(s) they seek to advance.  Wherein this NOTICE is a request for Allied Organizations for future Challenges, submitting a Challenge Concept and Team Capability are optional. If interested organizations would like to propose a Challenge, they will need to include the Challenge Concept that they wish to pursue with NASA. Details on the essential capabilities of Allied Organizations and desired characteristics of Challenge Concepts provided in Section V and Section VI of this NOTICE respectively. A complete submission as detailed in Section VIII is required for each Challenge Concept.</p>
<p>NASA will only consider submissions that include both 1) a Challenge Concept and 2) institutional capability and interest in being an Allied Organization.</p>
<p>Based upon a review of the capabilities of the proposed Allied Organization and the merit of the proposed Challenge Concept, NASA may consider partnerships with several proposed Allied Organizations to pursue their proposed Challenges. Participation in a Challenge as an Allied Organization will be contingent upon selection by NASA and negotiation of an appropriate nonreimbursable Space Act Agreement between NASA and the proposer.</p>
<p>Respondents acknowledge that submitting a Challenge Concept in response to this NOTICE does not preclude NASA from using such concept, or similar concepts, in a future Challenge hosted by another Allied Organization.</p>
<p>II. ELIGIBILITY TO BE AN ALLIED ORGANIZATION</p>
<p>Under 51 U.S.C. 20144, NASA is only allowed to partner with private, domestic, U.S. non-profit organizations as Allied Organizations for Challenges of the type described by this Notice. Organizations of any type, and individuals, may collaborate and submit a joint response describing their support of a designated private, domestic, U.S. non-profit organization that would lead the Challenge effort as the Allied Organization.</p>
<p>Neither Allied Organizations, their collaborators, nor employees, associates nor students associated with the proposing institutions will be eligible to win a prize funded by NASA in a Challenge that they manage. Allied Organizations, collaborators, and their officers and employees may not have a financial or other interest in any teams that compete in any Challenge they manage.</p>
<p>III. SPACE ACT AGREEMENT</p>
<p>A nonreimbursable Space Act Agreement (SAA) will specify the contributions and responsibilities of NASA and the Allied Organization for further development of a specific Challenge Concept.</p>
<p>The agreement will address intellectual property rights, concurrence on rules, team agreements, media rights, insurance, registration fees and eligibility, term, and related areas as well as other requirements imposed by 51 U.S.C. 20144 and applicable law. NASA reserves the right to select for SAA negotiations all, some, or none of the responses submitted to this NOTICE, and in the event no responses are selected, NASA reserves the right to post an additional NOTICE or NOTICES with respect to new Challenges. Respondents will be responsible for funding their own activities associated with responding to this NOTICE, as well as further developing and conducting a Challenge. Allied Organizations may collect reasonable registration fees from competitors but the use of registration fees as a primary means to cover Challenge administration costs is discouraged.</p>
<p>For additional information regarding Space Act Agreements, see NASA Policy Directive 1050.1 Authority to Enter into Space Act Agreements (https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?t=NPD&amp;c=1050&amp;s=1I).</p>
<p>IV. CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The NASA Centennial Challenges Program was established to conduct prize competitions to stimulate innovation in basic and applied research, technology development, and prototype demonstration that have the potential for application to the performance of the space and aeronautical activities of NASA. Those competing for the NASA monetary prizes can be individuals, independent teams, student groups, research organizations or private companies.</p>
<p>The Program seeks unconventional solutions from non-traditional sources and, therefore may lead to identifying new talent and stimulating the creation of new businesses. Competitors retain ownership of their intellectual property.</p>
<p>To be eligible to win a NASA Centennial Challenge prize, an individual or entity (1) shall have registered to participate in the competition pursuant to any rules promulgated by NASA; (2) shall have complied with all the rules of the competition and requirements of applicable law; (3) in the case of a private entity, shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States, and in the case of an individual, whether participating singly or in a group, shall be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States; and (4) shall not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment.</p>
<p>The Centennial Challenges in the past have typically required several annual competitions to occur before the total prize purses have been claimed. Competitions have been conducted in a first-to-demonstrate format and in a head-to-head contest format. The competition events, especially in the head-to-head contest format, have typically involved public spectators, televised or webcasted coverage and are utilized as high-visibility opportunities for public outreach. Additional information can be found at www.nasa.gov/challenges.</p>
<p>V. ALLIED ORGANIZATIONS ESSENTIAL CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>Allied Organizations will be responsible for some, or all, of the following during the formulation and execution phases: Challenge planning, Challenge formulation and execution funding, competitor recruitment and registration, Challenge administration, and execution Challenge marketing and publicity.</p>
<p>VI. CHALLENGE CONCEPTS</p>
<p>NASA is seeking ideas for technology demonstration competitions that address major issues leading to new aerospace capabilities. Competitions will involve technology development and prototype demonstrations. This NOTICE is for formulation of new prize competitions with prize purses up to $10M. Solution to the challenge should be achievable within a 10-year time frame and motivate a substantial number of competitors. Large prize and long term challenges may be submitted as phased competitions with lower value and short time frames. Technology advancement is a key requirement; technology advancements in any area that improves NASA's ability to perform future missions will be an important consideration. However, not all technology advancement efforts fit well under the construct of a prize competition. The following are the characteristics of an ideal Challenge Concept for the Centennial Challenges Program: <br />1) Demonstrates a new capability that addresses a NASA technical challenge included in the Space Technology Roadmaps (http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/roadmaps/) or aligns with the NASA aeronautics research portfolio (http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/programs.htm)<br />2) Has future application beyond potential NASA missions, including both aerospace and non-aerospace applications<br />3) Achieves a first-time accomplishment that establishes the existence of a solution to a well-defined problem, and opens a potential new market<br />4) Does not replicate work developed under current or past grant or contract activities, or private sector investments. The Challenge should involve the type of activity that is not easily achieved through grant or contract, such as efforts that will require successive design attempts to achieve the desired capabilities<br />5) Is open to many possible solutions<br />6) Creates an exciting opportunity for potential competitors and attracts a diverse set of non-traditional aerospace players and/or non-traditional competitor partnerships<br />7) Is easy to objectively determine the winner with the resulting achievement of high value relative to the prize value<br />8) Captures public attention with a competition environment appealing to media coverage and public engagement.</p>
<p>VII. SELECTION CRITERIA</p>
<p>Submissions will be judged based upon the Challenge Concept and Team Capability and as described below. <br />A. Concepts will be judged on the degree of alignment of the Challenge Concept to the eight characteristics of an ideal solution as provided in Section VI, and compliance with the $10M prize limit and 10-year duration limit. <br />B. Team Capability of the proposed Allied Organization and team partners will be judged on 1) experience of the organization and team partners in similar or analogous activities that demonstrate competence, integrity, commitment to safety, and ability to work cooperatively in partnering arrangements and 2) the capability to administer the proposed Challenge and competition events including the ability to: <br />a) formulate and finalize competition rules, judging criteria, and competition plans in consultation with NASA and with appropriate public comment. <br />b) access technical expertise in the area of the Challenge and select qualified and impartial judges. <br />c) access funds and other resources required to successfully execute Challenge requirements. <br />d) secure appropriate competition venues and supporting equipment. e) publicize and promote the goals of the proposed Challenge through creative use of public media including websites.</p>
<p>A selection, if any, will be in NASA's sole discretion.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to award, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC), Inc. in Dublin, OH, for catalog and interlibrary loan services for nine NOAA libraries for the catalog of electronic and print documents and the ability for NOAA librarians to access interlibrary loan through OCLC to obtain material not available within NOAA for NOAA researchers. These services are the the NOAA Library and Information Services Division in Silver Spring, MD.
<p>A Sources Sought notice was posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website on June 16, 2017 and closed on June 23, 2017. No response was received.</p>
<p><br />Sole Source Justification<br />OCLC is a non-profit, membership, computer library service and research organization dedicated to the public purposes of furthering access to the world's information and reducing costs. It was founded in 1967 as Ohio College Library Center and has grown to include more than 72,000 libraries in 170 countries. OCLC and its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain WorldCat, the largest online public access catalog in the world. WorldCat has holding records from public and private libraries worldwide.</p>
<p>The OCLC database for cataloging and searching purposes uses the Connexion computer program. OCLC services are used to locate, acquire, catalog, lend, and preserve library materials. The OCLC database contains records in Machine Readable Cataloging (MARC) format contributed by library catalogers worldwide who use OCLC as a cataloging tool. These MARC format records are then downloaded into the libraries' local catalog systems. This allows libraries to find and download records for materials to add to their local catalog without the lengthy process of cataloging each individually. Titles not available in WorldCat can be added by member libraries for use by all in the system.</p>
<p>The NOAA Library and Information Network which comprises of over 20 NOAA libraries around the country have been using OCLC and its services for over 40 years. The main OCLC services are cataloging and interlibrary loan. There is no other company that has the resources available to provide the services required by NOAA.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to award, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Dusky Marine, Inc., for one Dusky 252 CSS boat for the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) in Miami, FL.
<p>A Sources Sought was posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website on June 2, 2017 and closed on June 12, 2017. One amendment was posted on June 12, 2017 and the close date was extended until June 22, 2017. No viable responses were received.</p>
<p>Background<br />This vessel will be used to serve two long-standing projects whose purposes are to understand<br />resilience of coral reefs to environmental perturbations, habitat monitoring in Florida's coral reef<br />tract to assess population and habitat trends, effects of ocean acidification and eutrophication, and ecosystem responses to natural events (e.g. hurricanes), management measures and anthropogenic impacts. Furthermore, one of the premier long-term time series for study of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) phenomenon is the record of transport and water mass variability in the Florida Current/Gulf Stream and the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) collected as part of the NOAA Western Boundary Time Series (WBTS) program. This project has provided over 35 years of data on the interannual and decadal fluctuations associated with climate variability.</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification<br />This vessel satisfies the conflicting needs of both the climate study and ocean acidification projects, by maximizing the range of over 150 nautical miles, deck space, and safety features, while preserving a minimal draft and size constraints. Due to the nature of the work, the boat must be equipped with a cabin large enough to store six sets of dive gear and auxiliary dive and safety gear. While in the field for multi-day missions, the vessel often serves as an office or base of operations. AOML must store mission equipment, safety equipment and SCUBA gear in a securely locked space. A full SCUBA unit occupies about 5 cu ft of space and can travel with up to 6 divers. All necessary gear will fill a 60 cu ft cabin.</p>
<p>Required specifications:</p>
<p>1. LOA - 25'. A length over all (LOA) of 25' is to allow a deck area of at least 120" x 72" and a cabin area of at least 60 cu ft. (The detailed needs of the deck and cabin are outlined below).&nbsp; This vessel will still fall within the NOAA Small Boat Program's specifications for a class 1 vessel (A class one vessel must be 27" or less) and fit in our existing boat bay.</p>
<p>2. Beam - 8'. To fit in our existing boat bay and maximize the deck area. The current space designated for this vessel can accommodate a vessel and trailer no more than 8' wide.</p>
<p>3. Draft - 18". Due to the nature and location of our operations, we must have a draft of 18 inches or less. This is to prevent any possible damage as we navigate in confined waters at possibly low tide. In addition, scientific divers conduct research near very shallow patch reefs and must be approached with caution.</p>
<p>4. Power - Twin 150hp outboard engines for safety in redundancy and enough power to carry gear and personnel. Diving will be part of the primary mission for this vessel and current NOAA Dive Program regulations require that in the event of an incident or casualty we have the capability to transport a diver (possibly injured or unconscious) to secondary care or a hyperbaric chamber within 6 hours. Redundant engines would ensure we still have that capability in the event of a breakdown.</p>
<p>5. Dive ladder and stern platform - An uncluttered platform with a robust dive ladder on the stern is a critical point of entry and egress for scientific divers. Many dive injuries occur when exiting or entering the small boat. For divers to safely enter the boat, we require a 4' ladder with a minimum of 4 rungs and two side rails. The ladder connects to an open back platform with a removable polypropylene transom door. The intent is for the diver to safely move from the water to the interior of the vessel while wearing SCUBA gear. Since our divers typically operate while holding cumbersome scientific equipment, they must be able to enter the small boat while wearing full SCUBA gear.</p>
<p>6. Deck area - minimum open space of 120" x 72". During our primary operations we deploy divers in pairs while "live boating" (Divers deploy while the boat is still moving). To safely deploy divers while live boating in constantly changing environmental conditions it is a requirement that they be able to move quickly and deploy in pairs from either, or both sides of the vessel. To ensure safe and rapid deployment the deck must be wide enough for two divers, in full SCUBA gear, to walk side by side between gear benches along an unobstructed deck (no gear or battery boxes as found on other boats). We have determined that&nbsp; the minimum adequate width between benches is 32" and the minimum bench width is 20" for a total of 80" of deck width. The length of 120" for the deck is required to allow space for gear benches (50") a deployment area aft of the gear benches (60") and space for emergency oxygen storage forward of the benches (10"). The 60" of deployment space is to allow two divers to sit side by side and deploy. The extra 10" of width for each diver (based off the 20" required for sitting and walking mentioned earlier) is to ensure the divers gear does not&nbsp;&nbsp;entangle on each other or on the boat while they are deploying.</p>
<p>7. Cuddy Cabin - This boat must contain a cuddy cabin, a small shelter cabin forward of the conning station. This cuddy cabin is designed to store diving and support equipment. The conning station (helm) must be open and exposed to the back deck, to allow the boat captain quick and free access to assist with diver entry and egress.</p>

<SUBJECT>Collaborative Opportunity for High Energy Density Glass Capacitors
<SOLNBR>17_479
<RESPDATE>071117
<CONTACT>David V. Wick, Licensing Executive, Phone 5058442517, Email dvwick@sandia.gov
<DESC>Title:<br />Collaborative Opportunity for High Energy Density Glass Capacitors<br />Background Information:<br />Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) has made an initial investment in the research and development of high energy density capacitors based on alkali-free glasses. Lab scale demonstrations on processing commercial available glass and packing into multi-layer glass capacitors (MLGC) show great potential to disrupt the capacitive energy storage industry. SNL is seeking industrial partners interested in investing in the scale up and production of MLGCs for commercialization of this product.<br />Sandia National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International, Inc., for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA0003525. <br /><br />Opportunity Description:<br />SNL is seeking a collaboration with a business partner with proven experience in the design and manufacturing of high performance capacitors. The objective of this collaboration will be the joint development and demonstration of full scale prototype capacitors having energy densities exceeding existing state of the art. The existing technology resides at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3. Through the program the TRL needs to be raised to a level of 6 or 7.  Collaborators will work with SNL on the continued development of glass thinning and packaging technologies, and will provide a clear path to commercialization and deployment of capacitors to the market. Qualified respondents will contribute resources and in-kind support in the form of staff and facilities capable of handling and processing ultra-thin glass into MLGCs. Qualified respondents will have the option to obtain, up to and including, an exclusive license to the intellectual property for reasonable compensation as part of the agreement.<br /><br />What SNL Brings to the Collaboration:<br />SNL brings substantive experience in the design, development, and testing of novel dielectric materials for next generation capacitor applications. SNL provides expertise in dielectric materials within the Electronic, Optical, &amp; Nano Materials department and advanced packaging technologies within the Microsystems Packaging &amp; Polymer Processing department. Our expertise also includes access to state of the art fabrication facilities (MESA) and testing capabilities through the Material, Physical, and Chemical Sciences Center. This opportunity builds off of considerable knowledge of the underlying materials science and physics challenges associated with the fabrication of MLGCs that has through a multi-year program at the laboratories. We will rely primarily on our industrial partner for manufacturing, marketing, and other tasks that are product and profit focued.<br /><br />Information Sought:<br />A detailed description of the relevant background experience, expertise, and capabilities that could be brought into a collaborative partnership with SNL is being sought. The following information is requested. <br />-	Description of the experience, expertise, and capabilities in the design, fabrication, and testing of multi-layer capacitors.<br />-	Description of other relevant experience, expertise, and capabilities (e.g. handling and process of brittle materials, experience with ultra-thin glass, etc.)<br />-	Description of relevant experience in taking technology from a TRL 3 level to commercialization.<br />-	Description of past experience partnering with Research and Development organizations such as Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), Universities, National Laboratories, or Government Laboratories to develop and sell products successfully.<br /><br />Instructions to Respondents:<br />Interested parties that meet the Mandatory Requirements provided below are invited to respond to this FBO. Any information provided in response to this FBO will not be returned. Any and all responses are voluntary and SNL will not pay for any information submitted in response to this FBO. Only electroic submissions will be accepted. Responses should be emailed to elucero@sandia.gov and should include the FBO title and submitting organization's name in the subject line. Attachment size should not exceed 5MB and only the following document types will be accepted (.doc, .docx, .pdf). Responses should be submitted electronically no later than 5:00 p.m. MDT on TBD.<br />Evaluation Criteria:<br />SNL will evaluate all responses and select prospective parties with which to engage in further discussions based on the following criteria, pursuant to SNL's Technology Transfer mission:<br /><br />Mandatory:<br />-	Meet the DOE requirement of enhancement or accrual of economic and technological benefits to the U.S. domestic economy through the technology transfer. <br />&#61656;	Required by DOE in the Technology Transfer Act of 1989. <br />-	Provide experience, expertise, and capability manufacturing capacitors. <br />&#61656;	The SNL team has developed process and packaging techniques using conventional manufacturing approaches with a transition to an experienced capacitor manufacturing firm foremost in mind. <br />-	Present a clear, consistent, and comprehensive growth strategy on how the commercialization partner will provide cost effective, high energy density capacitors to the US market. <br />&#61656;	Development within SNL has been jointly sponsored by the DoD and DOE through the Joint Munitions Program (JMP), which seek industrial partnerships capable of ultimately supply capacitors to the market for military and civilian applications. Any licensing arrangement with a DOE lab needs to have agreed upon milestones and commercialization goals that reflect the goals of the JMP. <br />-	Demonstrate a willingness and ability to adopt manufacturing approaches best suited for MLGC fabrication. <br />&#61656;	Successful commercialization will require a company with innovative solutions for handling and processing ultrathin glass to reliably produce high performance capacitors.<br />-	Provide a business plan that specifies how MLGCs will be mass produced and commercialized. <br />&#61656;	The business plan is an essential ingredient of successful technology transfer. A breakdown on where the work will be done will help DOE fulfill its U.S. economic enhancement objective outlined in the DOE Prime Contract # DE-AC04-94AL85000. <br />-	The terms of the partnership must comply with Federal Export Control requirements per the Department of State. <br />&#61656;	This is embodied in the regulations in USC: Title 22 Foreign Relations and Intercourse and the DOE Prime Contract #DE-AC04-94AL85000.
<p>Desired:</p>
<p>-	A U.S. firm able to enter into a CRADA agreement with SNL to develop specific manufacturing tools and techniques for glass capacitor production. <br />-	Demonstrated experience, expertise, and capabilities in: the design, development, and manufacturing of multilayer capacitors. <br />-	Proven experience in translating immature technologies (TRL 3 - proof of concept) into market-driven products (TRL 7 - full scale prototype). <br />-	Demonstrated successful partnering and teaming relationships with R&amp;D organizations. <br />-	Strong interest in commercializing capacitors in a global market, including the ability to maintain, finance, and defend international patent filings. <br />-	Willingness to further develop, protect, and commercialize improvements and new applications for high energy density capacitor technologies.</p>

Award will be made to the lowest priced quote that has an acceptable technical rating. The evaluation will proceed as follows:<br />a. Technical: Initially, the Government's evaluation team will evaluate the technical quote to ensure it clearly meet the items identified in the solicitation's SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES (CLINs X001-X004). Also, offeror's written documentation from Microsoft will be evaluated to validate "Microsoft Licensing Service Providers (LSP) status." Only authorized Microsoft LSPs will be acceptable.<br />Technical will be assigned ratings of Acceptable (clearly meets minimum requirements) and Unacceptable (does not meet minimum requirements).<br />b. Price: Finally, the Government will evaluate the price of all quotes that receive an acceptable technical rating. Each offeror's quoted price ("SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES") will be evaluated for reasonableness. The Government may use any of the following price analysis techniques IAW FAR 13.106-3(a) to determine price reasonableness: competitive quotes, comparison of the proposed price with prices found reasonable on previous purchases, a comparison with similar items in a related industry, comparison to an independent Government estimate, or any other reasonable basis. Price will always be an important factor; therefore, offerors should make diligent efforts to control costs and submit fairly priced quotes.<br />CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS:<br />The following clauses apply:<br />By Reference:<br />52.202-1 Definitions (NOV 2013)<br />52.203-3 Gratuities (APR 1984)<br />52.203-6 Alt I Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government (SEP 2006)<br />52.203-12 Limitation on Payments to Influence Certain Federal Transactions (OCT 2010)<br />52.203-17 Contractor Employee Whistleblower Rights And Requirement To Inform Employees Of Whistleblower Rights (APR 2014)<br />52.204-4 Printed or Copied Double-Sided on Postconsumer Fiber Content Paper (MAY 2011)<br />52.204-10 Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards (OCT 2016)<br />52.204-13 System for Award Management Maintenance (JUL 2013)<br />52.209-6 Protecting the Government's Interest When Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment (OCT 2015)<br />52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items (JAN 2017)<br />52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation for HUBZone Small Business Concerns (OCT 2014)<br />52.219-8 Utilization of Small Business Concerns (NOV 2016)<br />52.219-28 Post-Award Small Business Program Representation (JUL 2013)<br />52.222-19 Child Labor-Cooperation With Authorities and Remedies (OCT 2016)<br />52.222-22 Previous Contracts and Compliance Reports (FEB 1999)<br />52.222-37 Employment Reports on Veterans (Feb 2016)<br />52.223-18 Encouraging Contractor Policies to Ban Text Messaging While Driving (AUG 2011)<br />52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases (JUN 2008)<br />Page 5 of 12<br />52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-- System for Award Management (JUL 2013)<br />52.232-39 Unenforceability of Unauthorized Obligations (JUN 2013)<br />52.233-3 Protest after Award (AUG 1996)<br />52.233-4 Applicable Law For Breach Of Contract Claim (OCT 2004)<br />52.242-13 Bankruptcy (JUL 1995)<br />252.203-7000 Requirements Relating To Compensation Of Former DoD Officials (SEP 2011)<br />252.203-7002 Requirement To Inform Employees Of Whistleblower Rights (SEP 2013)<br />252.204-7003 Control Of Government Personnel Work Product (APR 1992)<br />252.204-7012 Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting (OCT 2016)<br />252.209-7004 Subcontracting With Firms That Are Owned Or Controlled By The Government Of A Country that is a State Sponsor of Terrorism (OCT 2015)<br />252.223-7008 Prohibition Of Hexavalent Chromium (JUN 2013)<br />252.225-7012 Preference For Certain Domestic Commodities (DEC 2016)<br />252.232-7003 Electronic Submission Of Payment Requests And Receiving Reports (JUN 2012)<br />252.232-7010 Levies On Contract Payments (DEC 2006)<br />252.243-7001 Pricing Of Contract Modifications (DEC 1991)<br />252.243-7002 Requests For Equitable Adjustment (DEC 2012)<br />252.244-7000 Subcontracts For Commercial Items And Commercial Components (DoD Contracts) (JUN 2013)<br />252.247-7023 Transportation Of Supplies By Sea-Basic (APR 2014)<br />By Full Text:<br />FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms And Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders--Commercial Items (Deviation 2013-O0019) (JAN 2017)<br />(a) Comptroller General Examination of Record.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ); solicitation number is W911QY-17-Q-DAB2. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-95, effective 19 January 2017.</p>
<p>The US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) has a requirement for the purchase of a vacuum conveying, drying and blending system in support of research and development (R&amp;D) objectives for its fiber production facility.</p>
<p>This is a full and open competition using Simplified Acquisition Procedures IAW Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 under NAICS code 333249 Other Industrial Machinery Manufacturing. The small business size standard is 500 employees. Funds are not presently available for this acquisition. The issuance of this solicitation does not commit the Government to make an award.</p>
<p><br />DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>1. The Contractor shall deliver and, optionally, install a commercially available, vacuum conveying, drying and blending system that meets the specifications defined in Attachment 1 - Statement of Work (SOW). The line items (CLINs) below are anticipated to be included in the resultant contract. The offeror shall provide a price for CLIN 0001 and may provide a price for CLINs 0002 and 0003, if the offeror provides installation services with its own or subcontractor personnel, below in its quotation. The proposed price for CLIN 0003 shall also include travel costs to the NSRDEC in Natick, MA to perform the onsite installation. CLIN 0004 is not separately priced (NSP) and will be included in the cost of CLIN 0001 (see paragraph 2 below).</p>
<p>All CLINs must be inclusive of all charges and with FOB Destination shipping terms.</p>

If installation is included in this quote, a price for CLIN 0002 must be provided. If installation is not included in this quote, but the Offeror is able to provide the flex hose apart from proposing installation, a price for CLIN 0002 is desired. Pricing for Installation (SOW para 2.b(2)) and associated travel (SOW para 3), if part of this quote, shall be priced in CLIN 0003.</p>
<p>2. The Contractor shall deliver utility interface connection documentation (e.g., engineering drawings, piping and instrumentation diagram (P&amp;IDs), plus any support utility requirements) in accordance with Exhibit A - DD Form 1423 Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) A001.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS (ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-1):</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate all submitted responses in accordance with the submission and evaluation criteria described herein. Failure to include any of the items below may render the Offeror non-responsive. Responses to this announcement shall include:</p>

The quotation shall not include taxes (tax exempt certificate may be provided to the awardee upon request).

<p>2. Completed and signed representations and certifications. As prescribed in DFARS 252.204-7004, interested parties must be registered with System for Award Management (SAM) under the NAICS 333249. Representations and certifications must also be on record. These registrations can be done through the System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. Contractors are encouraged to complete SAM registration as soon as possible; the Government may not delay award for the purpose of allowing a contractor time to register in SAM.</p>
<p>3. In accordance with DFARS 252.225-7036, completion of Attachment 3, the certification and identification of country of origin for products delivered under this contract as found at DFARS 252.225-7035, is required.</p>

Contract/purchase order number, date and brief description<br />b. Name, e-mail address, and telephone number of POC <br />Offerors are advised that the Government may obtain Past Performance information from interviews/questionnaires tailored to the circumstances of this acquisition and/or any other sources available to the Government, to include, but not limited to, the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), or other databases; interviews with Program Managers, Contracting Officers, and Fee Determining Officials; and the Defense Contract Management Agency.</p>
<p>5. The Offeror shall also include product specifications in sufficient detail that demonstrate the proposed drying and blending system's conformance to the Statement of Work - Attachment 1.</p>
<p><br />ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION CRITERIA:</p>
<p>Award will be made to the responsible (See also DFARS 252.213-7000), responsive Offeror whose offer represents the best value based upon a comparative evaluation of offers IAW FAR 13.106-2. The Government shall evaluate the technical acceptability of the offer's quoted product (see para 5 above) for the description of the requirement contained in Attachment 1 - Statement of Work, past performance, and price. Price shall be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness and be inclusive of the optional CLINs, however, offeror's providing installation services will receive a higher technical evaluation. Price and non-price factors are equal in importance, therefore the Government reserve the right to award to other than the most highly rated, or other than the lowest price, offer. The Government intends to award without discussions but reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.</p>

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government and whose offer is the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA). Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.

<p>1. TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT APPROACH (non-cost)</p>
<p>Each Offeror will be evaluated on a contractor-provided approach formulated to meet the requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW). The proposal should fully outline the capabilities and methodology to provide the services as required. Proposal must include pricing for all option periods.</p>
<p>2. PAST PERFORMANCE (non-cost)</p>
<p>Offerors will be evaluated on their recent (within the past 3 years) performance of relevant services as described in the requirements of the SOW. Past performance will be evaluated to determine that each offeror has performed in a satisfactory manner in the performance of similar services as those specified in the SOW and whose past performance does not pose a risk to the Government. Offerors should provide references for the same or similar work performed for Federal, State, and local government and private clients. For each services project used to demonstrate the relevant past performance, the Offeror must provide appropriate point of contact information for the individual within the client agency/firm overseeing the services performed. An Offeror may also provide information on problems encountered on the identified projects and the offer's corrective actions. The Government will consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the offeror's past performance.

Price evaluation will be based on Contractor's overall pricing for base plus option periods. The Government will evaluate pricing each year, adding each copier price together to get the total cost for each of the base and option years. These yearly prices will then be added together to determine the total price for the entire period of performance. The total price for the entire period of performance will be used as the offeror's lowest price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

A logical access control system (LACS) requires validation of an individual identity through some mechanism such as a personal identification number (PIN), card, username and password, biometric, or other token. The system has the capability to assign different access privileges to different persons depending on their roles and responsibilities in an organization.</p>

<DESC>Background: The Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC) is currently using Bone holders Large Set. This set provides surgeons the capability to perform an open reduction internal fixation surgical procedure to fix a severe bone fracture, or break.  Open reduction  means surgery is needed to realign the bone fracture into the normal position.  Internal fixation  refers to the steel rods, screws, or plates used to keep the bone fracture stable in order to heal the right way and to help prevent infection. The Operating Room requests more systems to support their caseloads because currently surgeries are being delayed and with increasing the par level for the Bone Holders Large Set will ensure fewer delays in cases for procedures to better serve the Veterans. This purchase will enhance the VAMC Houston ability to perform surgeries as needed in the Operating Room.

(a) service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB); 
(b) veteran-owned small business (VOSB); 
(c) all other small business concerns; 
(d) other than small business. 
(2) If an award or a sufficient number of awards cannot be made at the first tier, evaluation of offers will proceed at the next lower tier until an award or a sufficient number of awards can be made.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 339112, with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees.

<p class="Body"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">The Communications Technology Laboratory (CTL), Radio Frequency Technology (RFT) Division, is in the process of expanding its research efforts related to spectrum sharing. This research spans a broad area covering topics associated with distributed spectrum sensing, signal propagation, interference between devices and networks, and evaluating a device&rsquo;s ability to share spectrum. To support this research effort, novel test methodologies are being developed that require characterization of complex RF signaling chains and system level components. In addition, as adjacent band interference becomes more prevalent, system designers are developing mitigation techniques with very high rejection capabilities. To evaluate these types of approaches and inform industry on their measurement methodologies, it is mission critical to test implementations with an extremely high dynamic range vector network analyzer. This capability will greatly expand the current laboratory infrastructure and address current research challenges as well as future needs. </span></p>

<p><br />NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov no later than 1000 hrs PST, July 7, 2017.</p>
<p>(xviii) Contact Beverly J. Parker at (541) 867-8730 or beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov  for information regarding this solicitation.</p>

into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

This solicitation is primarily for the National Forests in the Pacific Northwest (Region 6), and the majority of the work and project sites will be in Oregon and Washington across public lands. Calls under this BPA may also be issued by other Forest Service Regions and all Service First partner agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, and National Fish and Wildlife Service, among others (https://www.fs.fed.us/servicefirst)</p>
<p>The Government anticipates approximately 3-5 awards per each of the five (5) items (see general description of items in this solicitation).</p>
<p>Over the duration of the BPA, individual calls with actual quantities will be issued and competed. Only vendors in the initial award pool will be allowed to submit a quote on the work offered, but are not required to offer on all orders. No restrictions have been set regarding the number of vendors in the award pool; however, sufficient awards will be made to provide for adequate competition for calls.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p>(End of instructions)</p>

<p>15. Quotes may be only e-mailed directly to james.vannatta@navy.mil, the sole designated E-mail address and inbox for receipt of E-mail submissions. No other electronic means of submission, used in whole or in combination with E-mail, is permitted. No other method of submission is acceptable.</p>
<p>E-mail quotes shall be in either Adobe or Microsoft Office format.

<p>52.204-13 SYSTEM FOR AWARD MANAGEMENT MAINTENANCE (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) indicator means a four-character suffix to the unique entity identifier. The suffix is assigned at the discretion of the commercial, nonprofit, or Government entity to establish additional System for Award Management (SAM) records for identifying alternative EFT accounts (see subpart 32.11) for the same entity.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the unique entity identifier and the EFT indicator (if applicable), the Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>
<p>System for Award Management (SAM) means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>Unique entity identifier means a number or other identifier used to identify a specific commercial, nonprofit, or Government entity. See www.sam.gov for the designated entity for establishing unique entity identifiers.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph<br />(c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to <br />be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the unique entity identifier is maintained with the entity designated at www.sam.gov for establishment of the unique entity identifier throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the unique entity identifier to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the unique entity identifier does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED.&nbsp;</span></strong><br /><br />(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>(ii) The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-CSS-2017-382 and the solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) on a restricted basis, as a total set aside for small business vendors. A labor-hour contract type is contemplated for this requirement.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, and is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-94,2005-95 / 01-19-2017.</p>
<p>(iv) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690 - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services with associated small business size standard of $15 Million.</p>
<p>(v) Background:<br />The Division of Extramural Research (DER) provides management and oversight on the development, implementation, and coordination of NIDA's extramural programs, research training, policies, reviews, and operations planning.  Within DER is the Office of Extramural Policy and Review (OEPR) that is responsible for administering the peer and objective review of all Institute-based extramural grant applications; administering the concept and peer review of all NIDA research contract proposals; providing advice and guidance to the Director regarding the Institute's peer and objective review processes; providing scientific analyses of NIDA's extramural research program, assessing the breadth and scope of the Institute's research activities.  OEPR also liaises with NIDA Divisions and the NIH Guide office to develop and publish NIDA lead Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs) to award discretionary grants or cooperative agreements, usually as a result of competition for funds.</p>
<p>Due to the unpredictable nature and level of Funding Opportunity Announcements' applications received to conduct scientific review, support is needed to help with OEPR Scientific Review Officers' reviews. OEPR staff will conduct all functions that are inherently governmental functions.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objective: <br />The purpose of this purchase order is to provide professional and scientific support to the Office of Extramural Policy and Review (OEPR) primarily for grants and Research and Development (R&amp;D) contracts review functions. Support is needed in all areas of research funded by NIDA.  Knowledge of the peer review process, applicable laws, policies and regulations, and NIH guidelines is critical.</p>

References should include the following information:<br />a)	Name of organization<br />b)	Brief description of contractor responsibilities<br />c)	Point of contact name, title and telephone number<br />Past performances shall be evaluated for relevance to the current requirements as well as customer satisfaction in reference to the following:<br />1)	interpersonal skills<br />2)	attention to detail<br />3)	computer and software literacy<br />4)	writing communication and presentation skills</p>

<p>(x) The provision at FAR Clause 52.212-4 Alternate I, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Government is seeking sources to support multiple contracts for Foreign Military Sales (FMS). The purpose of this Market Research is to identify sources that can manufacture and supply the KIV-77 crypto computer, the AN/TPX-57 Identity Friend or Foe (IFF) Interrogator, and the AN/TPX-58 Identity Friend or Foe (IFF) Interrogator or equivalent. All equivalent devices must be the same Form, Fit, and Function down to the circuit card level as the KIV-77, AN/TPX-57, and AN/TPX-58. Equivalent IFF and communication security devices must be air worthy and qualified to go on rotary wing aviation platforms. <br />The contractor must be able to support all technical, operational, safety, interoperability and security testing requirements. The contractor company must be ISO 9001-2008 certified. Company must be registered with Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Please submit all responses, to include a detailed description of contractor qualifications and experience no later than July 23rd 2017.<br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT MARKET SURVEY. THERE IS NO SOLICATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary. This market survey does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP) or a request for sealed bids (IFB), nor does it issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay respondents for any information that they submit in response to this Sources Sought request. The United States Army CECOM LCMC is conducting this sources sought market survey to determine potential sources capable of fulfilling a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requirement.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY. 

This notice does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid. The intent of this notice is to identify potential Offerors that the Navy Facilities and Engineering Command at Naval Station Newport, Newport, Rhode Island, intends to solicit bids and award a firm-fixed price contract for the work described herein. The project location is at Naval Station Newport, Newport, Rhode Island. 

Project Description: 

Pier 2 is a general purpose berthing pier, serving home-ported and visiting vessels for the Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The pier was constructed in 1958 as part of a major expansion of fleet berthing and warehouse facilities at Naval Station Newport.

The pier is approximately 1575 feet long by 200 feet wide.
 It is supported by 3,116 concrete filled steel pipe piles. The piles support cast-in-place concrete pile caps at 10 feet on center, which in turn support a 10 1/2 inch thick reinforced concrete deck. The top surface of the deck is approximately 12 feet above mean low water (MLW). There is a clearance under the pier of about 10 feet at MLW.

Over the past 60 years, the existing 14 inch diameter steel piles have experienced corrosion in the splash zone.

The piles with major steel section loss require repair to maintain and restore the structural integrity of the pier. Ongoing restoration efforts have repaired approximately 445 piles since 2002.

The current project proposes repairs to 133 piles, with Options to repair an additional 412 piles.

The current pile repair project is being undertaken in support of the International Sea power Symposium (ISS), hosted at Naval Station Newport every two years by the Naval War College.
 The upcoming symposium will take place in 2018.

Scope:

Provide construction services, including all materials, labor, equipment, supervision, and construction management, to repair Pier 2 vertical support piles by partial-length concrete encasement per Plans and Specifications produced by NAVFAC, Facilities and Acquisition Division (FEAD), Naval Station Newport, Newport, Rhode Island.

The requirement will be solicited for as a total small business set-aside.

The Government will only accept offers from small business concerns. A determination by the Government to solicit for this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Procurement Method: Sealed Bidding in accordance with FAR part 14.
 

The resultant contract will be a Firm-Fixed Price contract.

The NAICS Code for this procurement is 236220 and the annual size standard is $36,500,000. 

Magnitude of Construction Project: $5,000,000.00 to $10,000,000.00. 

This is a new procurement. It does not replace an existing contract. No prior contract information exists. 

Potential Offerors can view or download the solicitation and any attachments at https://www.fbo.gov when it becomes available.

Potential Offerors are responsible for checking this website frequently for any changes made to this announcement or the related requirements.

In addition, the offerors must become qualified based on a Qualification Test Plan provided by the Government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This procurement includes technical documents assigned a restricted distribution statement and an export control warning. To receive this controlled technical data, an interested offeror must be currently certified through the United States/Canada Joint Certification Program.</p>
<p>To become certified for receipt of the technical documents, a U.S. interested offeror must submit a completed DD Form 2345 to the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office. Canadian interested offerors may submit either a completed DD Form 2345 or DSS-MAS 9379 for certification. In addition, a copy of the company's State/Provincial Business License, Incorporation Certificate, Sales Tax Identification Form or other documentation which verifies the legitimacy of the company must accompany all DD Form 2345s. Additional information on the Joint Certification Program and a checklist for completion of the DD Form 2345 is available at the following website: http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/. Interested offerors are encouraged to apply for certification as early as possible in order for processing to be completed in sufficient time to prepare a response before the Sources Sought closing.</p>
<p>The resultant IDIQ contracts will extend no longer than five years (60 months), if all options are exercised, from contract award. It will consist of one base year plus four option years. This requirement is considered a 100% small business set-aside. The NAICS code is 336419. The Size Standard is 1,000 employees. The FSC code is 1420. This&nbsp;requirement is for non-commercial supplies.&nbsp; All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>The Contractors shall deliver Booster Fin Kits in accordance with specific, individually written delivery orders issued by NSWC IHEODTD within the scope of the applicable Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
<p>The Government intends to make a multiple award resulting from the solicitation to the responsible offerors whose submissions, which comply with the instructions and conform to the solicitation, will be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. Best value will be determined based on an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors for award. The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers: (FACTOR 1) technical capability based on examination of facilities, manufacturing process, quality assurance plan, and management and schedule; (FACTOR 2) Past Performance (see FAR 52.212-1(b)(10)); and (FACTOR 3) Cost. These factors are listed in descending order of importance. All non-cost factors, when combined, are more important than cost; however, cost becomes more of a deciding factor of importance when offerors receive similar ratings for the other factors. General statements, that the offeror can or will comply with the requirements, that standard procedures will be used, that well known techniques will be used, or that paraphrases the RFP's specifications in whole or in part, will not constitute compliance with the mandatory requirements concerning the content of the technical proposal.</p>
<p>Copies of solicitation will NOT be emailed, faxed, mailed or provided in person. These types of requests WILL NOT BE ACKNOWLEDGED. This synopsis is being posted to Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at https://www.fbo.gov/.

Information regarding registration and annual confirmation requirements is available at 1-866-606-8220 and http://www.sam.gov. Any resultant contract will be DO Rated under the Defense Priorities and Allocations system (DPAS). The deadline to respond to this solicitation is 26 July 2017.</p>
<p>The Contract Specialist must receive any and all questions concerning the RFP no later than 5 business days before the response date of the solicitation.

<SUBJECT>Maintenance on equipment Installed by Yorktel Corporation
<SOLNBR>SSA-NOI-17-0624
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<ARCHDATE>06282017
<CONTACT>Greg Shanklin, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109659517, Email Greg.Shanklin@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate solely with Yorktel Corp. located at 81 Corbett Way, Eatontown, New Jersey 07724, for a firm fixed-priced order for the purchase of maintenance on government owned audiovisual, central control console, and presentation equipment&nbsp;installed by Yorktel Corporation.
<p>This action is in accordance with 41 U.S.C. &sect; 251, et seq., and 40 U.S.C. &sect; 50 as implemented by the Multiple Award Schedule Program, and under the procedures of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subsection 8.405-6 "Federal Supply Schedules-- Limiting Sources." Specifically, FAR 8.405-6 provides that orders placed under Federal Supply Schedules (FSS) are exempt from the competition requirements in Part 6 of the FAR. However, we are further restricting consideration pursuant to the following authority:<br />FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) Only one source capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.</p>
<p>SSA recently upgraded three of its lecture classrooms by installing new equipment with state of the art, improved functions to provide training to employees. The equipment installed consists of a programmable Crestron switcher, video teleconferencing equipment, 508 listening devices, DVD player, sound system, microphones, projectors, and televisions. Yorktel, the company that installed the new equipment, created a customized computer program for the programmable Crestron switcher, making Yorktel the proprietary owner. The switcher required a special program to recognize when the rooms where combined as one large lecture room and when they were serving as two individual lecture rooms. This allows the system to turn on and off different functions in each room depending on whether the rooms are combined or separated. Yorktel also provided individualized switcher software to route audio and video equipment in each room. Yorktel provided the installation and the programming with a one-year manufacturer warranty. This acquisition for a maintenance contract with Yorktel will provide telephone help desk support, dispatched onsite technician support to repair equipment, and repair or replacement of malfunctioning equipment.<br /><br />Yorktel is the proprietary owner of the specific programming that makes the Crestron switcher operate. Yorktel can deactivate it. Without the programming, we would not be able to program video sources into the monitors. We would not be able to hear instructors without microphones or audio from the equipment. We would not have audio augmentation for employees with disabilities. We would not be able to call and receive Video Teleconferences. Yorktel must be selected as the maintenance provider; otherwise, we would have to do a complete full and open re-compete for the design and installation of the equipment already installed. This would be unnecessary for something that already exists. In addition, the classrooms would not be available for use during the installation of the new equipment. <br /><br />The Government has determined not to compete this proposed order based upon this information. This is not a request for quotation. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed order is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

The remaining portion of Dam 53 is not required to be removed to provide a navigable lane and will be demolished under a separate contract.<br /><br />Over the last few years, Locks and Dams (L&amp;D)&nbsp;52 and 53 on the Ohio River have become more and more unreliable to maintain safe navigable passage through the lower Ohio River up to Smithland. Recent efforts to repair Dam 52 are proving unsuccessful in maintaining a reliable navigable passage. Olmsted L&amp;D&nbsp;is being constructed to replace L&amp;D 52 and 53, and is currently scheduled to become operational as early as July (no later than October) 2018. Once Olmsted L&amp;D is operational, L&amp;D 53 would become an imminent hazard to the safe passage of recreational and commercial traffic through this section of the Ohio River.<br /><br />The Olmsted L&amp;D project site is located 17 miles upstream on the Ohio River from the confluence with the Mississippi River and is an extremely challenging marine environment for construction activities. This stretch of the Ohio River is the busiest waterway in the United States and is considered the hub of the Inland Water Transportation System. To meet the current working schedule, the intent is to accomplish this work&nbsp;prior to&nbsp;both locks and dam being fully operational at the beginning of the 2018 low water season.&nbsp;<br /><br />All responsible sources may submit a capability statement to be considered by the agency. Capability statement must be submitted no later than 1:00 PM Eastern time on Tuesday,&nbsp;11 July&nbsp;2017 to <a href="mailto:Patrick.J.Duggins@usace.army.mil">Patrick.J.Duggins@usace.army.mil</a>. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.<br />

<DESC>Documentation of Award<br />In accordance with FAR 13.106-3, the following is the basis for:<br />"Contracting Officer's Award Decision"<br />Solicitation No.: AG-64R4-S-17-0034<br />Supply/Service: Sweco Dozer<br />Contract/PO No.: AG-64R4-P-17-0057<br />Awarded To: SWECO PRODUCTS
<p>Per FAR 13.106-3, prior to establishment of an award, the contracting officer must determine that the proposed price(s) is/are fair and reasonable. Whenever possible, base price reasonableness on competitive quotations or offers. However, when this is not possible, the determination may be based on market research; comparison of the proposed price with prices found reasonable on previous purchases; current price lists, catalogs, or advertisements; a comparison with similar items in a related industry; value analysis; personal knowledge of the item being purchased; comparison to an independent Government estimate; or any other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>Sole source (including brand name) justifications are modified to reflect that the procedures in FAR subpart 13.5 were used in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1901 or the authority of 41 U.S.C. 1903.</p>
<p>(1) Award is based on Open Market buying reasonableness thru the use of Electronic Commerce.</p>
<p>(2) Award is determined reasonable based on:</p>
<p>(i) _X__ Market Research: Within 18 months and World Wide Web technology.</p>
<p>(ii) _X__ Comparison of the proposed price with prices found reasonable on previous purchases. FPDS REVIEW OF SWECO PRODUCTS</p>
<p>(iii) _X__ Current price lists, catalogs, or advertisements.</p>
<p>(iv) __ A comparison with similar items in a related industry</p>
<p>(v) ___ The contracting officer's personal knowledge of item being purchased:</p>
<p>(vi) _X__ Comparison to an independent Government estimate: ATTACHED</p>
<p>(vii) _X_ Other reasonable basis: SOURCE SELECTION IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE FOREST SERVICE AND NECESSARY TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE FOREST SERVICE PROJECT NEEDS.</p>
<p>FAR 19.1506 Women-Owned Small Business Program sole source awards:</p>
<p>The acquisition is assigned a NAICS code 333111 in which SBA has determined that WOSB concerns are underrepresented in Federal procurement; SWECO PRODUCTS is listed as a WOSB in SAM/FPDS and is a responsible contractor with respect to performance and the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price.</p>
<p>Price comparisons made with survey of competitive quotes. SWECO PRODUCTS quote offers a Government price premium of $3,108.50. An informal analysis of prices or examination of the market indicates that the SWECO PRODUCTS price is a fair and reasonable price. The past performance record of SWECO PRODUCTS has been outstanding, they have vast experience in this area, proposed products are extraordinarily qualified, and the offeror proposes a price that is most advantageous in respect to Socio-Economic indicators. SWECO PRODUCTS is the most advantageous offer and provides the Best Value with consideration of warranty provisions, maintenance availability, and project need factors. DETERMINATION based on FAR PART 13.</p>
<p>Justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer's knowledge and belief.</p>

<AWARDEE>LinQuest Corporation, 5140  Goldleaf Circle, Suite 400, Los Angeles, CA US
<DESC>SOURCE SELECTION STATEMENT<br />Unmanned Aircraft Systems Satellite Communication Systems Study <br />RFQ 1182629
<p>Background<br />This procurement is to establish a Task Order (TO) under a GSA contract, which the contractor shall provide all supervision, personnel, material, equipment, and supplies to successfully perform and develop a conceptual system design study of a C2 Satellite Communications System consistent with preliminary performance requirements as specified in RTCA SC-228 documentation (DO 362). The system shall operate within allocated C-Band SatCom frequency spectrum for UAS (5030-5091 MHz) and operate compatibly with terrestrial line-of-sight C2 systems operating within the same band. To accomplish this effort, the Government will award a base TO for four months with three one-year options.</p>
<p>A Request for Proposal (RFP) was issued April 3, 2017. It was full-and-open competition on GSA E-Buy. Four offerors submitted proposals by the date of April 21, 2017. Proposals were submitted by Apogee Engineering, LinQuest Corporation, MTI Systems, and TriVector Services.</p>
<p>Evaluation Results<br />Proposals were evaluated in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedule. The proposals were evaluated considering three factors: Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price. The summary results are indicated below:</p>
<p>Apogee Engineering<br />Technical Capability was rated as Acceptable. Apogee's proposal satisfies all of the Government's requirements with some detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems, but overall they lacked the ability to demonstrate actual prior experience in developing a satellite communications architecture as requested. They indicated they have engineers that operate military satcom systems, but it didn't appear likely those people would be involved in the design study, nor whether they even had experience in designing a satcom system architecture from scratch to the level of detail required by the project. Their proposal offered a generic systems engineering approach to the design effort and lacked the level of detail offered by the recommended vendor.</p>
<p>A rating of Low Risk was assigned to the Performance Risk Factor. As indicated by their past performance, Apogee has provided systems engineering services to support development, integration, test, and fielding of Air Force UAS. However, they failed to indicate whether they had experience in designing a satcom system architecture from scratch to the level of detail required by the project.</p>
<p>Apogee Engineering's price was $. Review of their proposal revealed Apogee's proposal came out to be less expensive than LinQuest and MTI based on the fact that their proposal was suggesting the use of less experienced engineers. They also indicated they would need to hire an additional engineer to fill one of the roles which would likely impact the ability to successfully meet our aggressive milestone deliverable schedule during the baseline year.</p>
<p>LinQuest Corporation<br />Technical Capability was rated Outstanding. The proposal satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths. LinQuest provides a wealth of satellite communications engineering and development experience with both ground stations and satellites dating back to 1974. Their approach included a strong team of experienced satcom engineers with "reach back" beyond them as need to a larger breadth of knowledge within the company so they could access far more than the 1 or 2 engineers the other teams put forth in their proposals. Their proposed technical approach matches our expectations and their technical narrative and terminology indicates a comfortable level of experience with the work we are requesting.</p>
<p>A rating of Low Risk was assigned to the Performance Risk Factor. Little doubt exists, based on the LinQuest's past performance record, that the offeror can perform the proposed effort. <br />Their past performance examples indicate they successfully met their deliverables and have a track record of customer satisfaction and engineering excellence.</p>
<p>LinQuest's price was $. The Price proposal was considered to be complete. They included fully-burdened pricing for the labor categories typically required for this type of project. Their completeness was considered a significant strength in their pricing. While overall they are the most expensive quote, I consider them to be providing the best value with the greatest chance of successfully completing the milestones among the respondents given their company's extensive experience in the satellite communications field and their financial stability.</p>
<p>MTI Systems<br />Technical Capability was rated as Unacceptable. Their proposal contains a deficiency that indicates a lack of understanding of the approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal. Their technical response was very sparse at only around a page-and-a-half and lacked any real details on the approach they would be taking in the conceptual design study. Their proposed staffing for the project had a superior level of training and experience.</p>
<p>A rating of Low Risk was assigned to the Performance Risk Factor. Based on the MTI's past performance record, the Offeror can perform the proposed effort. However, most of their proposal revolved around talking about their current and past performance with other similar NASA projects, but they failed to demonstrate that they had sufficient experience with designing a satcom system from scratch rather than simply interacting with an existing architecture. MTI currently supports a related UAS effort at GRC: the UAS in the National Airspace System (NAS) - Communications sub-project. They have supported this effort throughout its first and second phases with two full-time engineers.</p>
<p>The Price proposal was considered complete. MTI's price was $.</p>
<p>TriVector Services<br />Technical Capability was rated as Unacceptable. Their proposal contains a deficiency that indicates a lack of understanding of the approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal. TriVector Services submitted a short and rather generic, response to the RFQ. Their proposal leaned heavily toward describing a generic systems engineering approach using modeling tools.</p>
<p>A Moderate Risk Level was assigned to the Performance Risk Factor. Some doubt exists, based on the Offeror's past performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort. They failed to demonstrate that they had sufficient experience with designing a satcom system. Due to the lack of experience overall with satcom system design, this proposal was deemed to be risky and we felt they would not likely be able to deliver the best overall value to the government. Their past experience failed to indicate a sufficient level of previous experience designing satellite communications systems.</p>
<p>The Price proposal was considered complete. TriVector Services' price was $. Their price proposal was the lowest of the four responses due to their proposed use of less experienced engineers than the other contractors.</p>
<p>Decision<br />After a review of the evaluation findings, I note in the area of Technical Capability, only LinQuest Corporation was rated as Outstanding. LinQuest had a number of strengths, which include a detailed description of their discipline, skills and techniques they will us in the performance of the work. LinQuest's rating in this area indicates a solid technical approach to accomplish the efforts required and provides a sound assurance of successful performance. I note that Apogee had an overall rating in Technical Capability of Acceptable while the other two offerors rated Unacceptable. Both Unacceptable offerors failed to provide descriptions of their discipline, skills and techniques they will use in the performance of the work as was required. I find that LinQuest has a significant advantage in this area.</p>
<p>In the area of Past Performance, I note that Apogee, LinQuest, and MTI all received a Low Risk Level. TriVector was considered a Moderate Risk Level due to their failure to demonstrate they had sufficient experience with designing a satcom system. LinQuest's past performance examples indicate they can successfully meet all deliverable requirements and have a track record of customer satisfaction and engineering excellence and is considered to have an advantage in this area.</p>
<p>In the area of Price, I note that TriVector's rates were considered complete and lower than the two contractor's rates by 7-25%. However, this is due to their proposed using less experienced engineers than other offerors. Apogee's proposal also came out to be less expensive than LinQuest and MTI based on the fact that their proposal was also suggesting the use of less experienced engineers. MTI, while being higher than TriVector and Apogee, was considered complete. MTI is considered to have a slight advantage in this area.</p>
<p>Based on the above, I find LinQuest Corporations' proposal conforms to the solicitation with technical capabilities, past performance, and price (only 4% higher than MTI); is considered to be most advantageous to the Government; provides the best-value solution to the Government; and I hereby select LinQuest Corporation for award.</p>

At the national level, the Contractor will work with the NTP on outstanding policy-related activities such as strategies, guidelines, and protocols. At a minimum, the Contractor will implement its TB control activities in six provinces, building on USAID&rsquo;s previous investments in TB. These provinces are: Northern, Luapula, Muchinga, Copperbelt, Central, and North-Western provinces. More specific geographic scope will be determined by USAID and the Contractor. The Activity&rsquo;s target communities have a high burden of TB, including underserved communities, people in congregate settings such as prisons, children, and People Living with HIV (PLHIV/ PLWHA).&nbsp;</span>

<DESC>The proposed contract is for the Defense Technology Security Administration (DTSA), which is the stewardship of technology security policy and programs for the Department of Defense (DoD). DTSA's technology security mission is to develop and implement policies on international transfers of defense-related goods, services, and technologies to ensure that such transfers are consistent with U.S. national security interests. Technology security policy development and implementation requires DTSA analysts to conduct extensive research and evaluation of data from numerous and diverse sources.
<p>The contractor's support is required to fully automate the National Disclosure Policy (NDP) decisional database and establish and maintain an automated workflow management and electronic filing systems in support of Directorate (and DTSA) requirements and initiatives. This database is essential to making consistent, informed decisions concerning the disclosure of classified military information to foreign governments and international organizations. The continued objective of the requested support is to maximize the services provided to the community at large by ISD, the NDPC Secretariat and to the National Disclosure Policy System (NDPS), the OSD Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Generator data base, the Data Exchange and Cooperative Program Agreements Data Base, and the Foreign Visit System (FVS). This requirement continues to be of utmost urgency.<br /></p>

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>$150K)
Acquisition Plan Action ID:  VA246-17-AP-8252
Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Network Contracting Office 6, on behalf of the Fayetteville VA Medical Center in Fayetteville, North Carolina, intends to procure Olympus  brand Visera 4K UHD Laparoscope and related accessories, under purchase request number 565-17-2-090-0120.

Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: The objective of this request is to procure Olympus  brand Visera 4K UHD Laparoscope and related accessories by means Other Than Full and Open Competition.  Delivery shall be to the VA Medical Center, 2300 Ramsey Street, Fayetteville, North Carolina 28301.  A new contract, firm-fixed-priced, is planned for this one-time equipment procurement.  
 
This procurement for the provision of Olympus  brand Visera 4K UHD Laparoscope and related accessories is in accordance with FAR 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items and specifically FAR 13.501 Special Documentation Requirements, where acquisitions conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2. 

Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs: 
VA Medical Center at Fayetteville, North Carolina has an Operating Room Renovation/Expansion project underway; additional laparoscopic equipment of the same brand and specifications, compatible with the existing equipment, is required for this procurement.  The estimated value of this procurement is $REDACTED.

Award will be made to Alliant Enterprises LLC, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concern (SDVOSB).
  
Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 3304(a)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  
 (X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
        Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
 (   )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
(   )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert services per FAR 6.302-3;
 (   )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
 (   )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
 (   )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
 (   )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

The authority for applying the Simplified Procedures for Commercial Items of  FAR 13.5 is 41 U.S.C. 1901 and is implemented by for restricting competition on this procurement via FAR 13.106-1(b)(2). 

Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  
VAMC Fayetteville has standardized laparoscopic surgical equipment to the Olympus  brand.  
The operating rooms at VAMC Fayetteville are currently undergoing renovation and expansion, and supplemental Brand Name equipment is required to ensure compatibility, as well as to maintain continuity of repair and maintenance processes for Biomedical Engineering staff.  Additionally, Brand Name equipment will allow for continuity of standard operating procedures for the clinical staff using this equipment. 

Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  In addition to Internet searches through FPDS, FBO, and SDBS, past procurements for same or similar equipment were reviewed.  As brand name equipment is required for compatibility with existing equipment, only sources that may provide Olympus brand product while retaining all warranties and product liability concerns were sought.  In addition to the manufacturer Olympus (OEM, large), one Small Business, PROAIM Medical LLC, and one Service Disabled, Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), Alliant Enterprises LLC, are known to the Contracting Officer as authorized distributors of the required equipment.  While the Vendor Information Pages (www.VetBiz.gov) provided 106 matches for NAICS 334510, insufficient competition is available to set-aside the procurement for SDVOSB concerns as a Letter of Supply was obtained from the manufacturer, indicating that only Alliant Enterprises LLC is authorized as an SDVOSB distributor of the required equipment.  
Additionally, this procurement is not suitable for a Small Business set-aside, as PROAIM Medical LLC and Alliant Enterprises LLC are bound by a partnering agreement with Olympus, and cannot directly compete against each other.

Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: The anticipated cost will be considered fair and reasonable based on the comparison to the Independent Government Cost Estimate and historical procurements for the same or similar equipment at the Fayetteville Medical Center as well as other VISN 6 sites of care.

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  As described in paragraph 6 above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by internet searches, as well as review of past procurements of the same or similar nature.

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  There are no further facts supporting this Justification other than those previously stated.

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: No sources expressed interest in writing as sources for the required brand name equipment are known to the Contracting Officer.

A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  
At this time, there are no actions that may be taken to overcome any barriers to competition.

Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

ORDER >$150,000 
FAR PART 8.405-6 
Acquisition Plan Action ID: VA246-17-AP-9332 
This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in paragraph 3 below is sole source; therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4   Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below. 
Restricted to the following source: 
Manufacturer/Contractor: Leica Incorporated (OEM), Government Scientific Source Inc. (distributor) 
Manufacturer/Contractor POC & phone number: Annette Cheltenham/800-248-8030 
Mfgr/Contractor Address: 12351 Sunrise Valley Drive, Reston, VA 20191 
Dealer/Rep address/phone number: Same as above 

The requested material or service represents the minimum requirements of the Government. 
(1) AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: Department of Veterans Affairs 
Network Contracting Office 6 
100 Emancipation Drive, Bldg. 27 
Hampton, VA 23667 
VISN: 6 

(2) NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED: 
The objective of this request is to procure Leica  brand Model ASP6025 Tissue Processor by means Other Than Full and Open Competition. Delivery shall be to the VA Medical Center, 1601 Brenner Avenue, Salisbury, North Carolina 28144. A new contract, firm-fixed-priced, is planned for this one-time equipment procurement. This award will be made to Government Scientific Source Inc. (a Veteran-Owned Small Business concern) under their GSA Schedule GS-07F-5934R.
 
(3) (a) A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY S NEED: 
VA Medical Center at Salisbury, North Carolina requires additional tissue processing equipment of the same brand and specifications, compatible with the existing equipment to meet increased workload demands. 
(b) ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE: $221,728.40 
(c) REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE: August 30, 2017 
(4)  IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.
- Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.). Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources. 
Salisbury VAMC requires the same brand equipment that is in use as a cost saving measure to eliminate the need for equipment management and training endeavors for two different makes/models of equipment. Government Scientific Source, Inc. is the only authorized distributor of the required brand name equipment.
- The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing. Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system. 
The additional equipment must be exact in order to utilize the existing tissue media and to ensure consistent testing results.

(5) DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION: 
- This Limited Justification represents the best value to the Government as the pricing is pre-determined as fair and reasonable. A competitive procurement would also duplicate administrative costs which are not likely to be recovered as additional stock media would be required in the event a different model of processor being introduced. Education and training efforts would also be required in support of competing for another brand/model of processor.

(6) DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
- Internet searches of FPDS, FBO, and DSBS indicate the required equipment is readily available through sufficient commercial sources. A search at VetBiz for NAICS 334516 provided 53 potential Service-Disabled/Veteran-Owned Small Business (SD/VOSB) entries, but providers of tissue processing equipment is not evident in these results. An additional search of GSA schedule holders under NAICS 334516 provided two Veteran Owned Small Businesses under Schedule 66, SIN 603 7 Laboratory Instruments; however, only one vendor (Government Scientific Source Incorporated) can provide the required brand name product under their GSA contract GS-07F-5934R. As such, the  Rule of Two  requirement cannot be met to support a competitive procurement.

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4   Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below.  

Restricted to the following source: 

Manufacturer/Contractor: Omnicell Incorporated 
Manufacturer/Contractor POC & phone number:  800-850-6664

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
This Request for Limited Justification is to procure proprietary workstations, printers, and scanners to enhance and supplement the existing Omnicell network of equipment and service at VAMC Fayetteville, NC.

(3) (a) A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY S NEED:
Additional proprietary Omnicell equipment and supplies are required to equip the newly renovated and expanded Operating Rooms at the VA Medical Center in Fayetteville, North Carolina. 
(b) ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $400,436.46

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
- The order represents Best Value as there are no other compatible systems that will suffice for the requirement.  Omnicell Inc. has been awarded a VA FSS schedule for the required equipment and does not have a distributor for stated equipment. 

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
- Market research was conducted in support of the requirement, including Internet searches of FBO, FPDS, and SDBS, as well as reviews of past procurements for the same supplies and service.  While a search at VetBiz pages for NAICS 511210 provides 239 matches, no Veteran Owned Small Businesses are authorized as license distributors of Omnicell software as evidenced by several recent NCO 6 procurements executed within 18 months of the current requirement:  VA246-17-F-5510; VA246-17-F-1462; VA246-16-F-8179; VA246-16-F-7988; VA246-16-F-6014; VA246-16-F-3848; VA246-16-F-3486.
