<DESC><p>INTRODUCTION<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice.</p>
<p>This is NOT a solicitation, request for proposals (RFP), proposal abstracts, nor a request for quotations (RFQ).</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System<br />(NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. The notice is strictly for research and information purposes only. <br /><br />ALL organizations with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><br />NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 541690 - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services and the associated small business size standard of $14 Million.</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />The National Institute on Mental Health Section on Neuroadaptation and Protein Metabolism (SNPM) has developed a fully quantitative method for measuring rCPS with L-[1-11 C]leucine and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The method was validated in rhesus monkeys by direct comparison of PET results with those from quantitative autoradiographic and biochemical methods (Schmidt KC et al, J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 25:617-628, 2005; Smith CB et al, J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 25:629-640, 2005). Subsequently, SNPM has performed PET studies to measure rCPS in healthy human subjects in the awake state and under propofol sedation (Bishu S et al, J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 28:1502-1513, 2008; Bishu S et al, J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 29:1035-1047, 2009), in subjects with Fragile X Syndrome (FrX) studied under propofol sedation (Qin M et al, J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 33:499-507, 2013), and in healthy subjects who were sleep deprived and studied while awake or during sleep (studies in progress). The SNPM is planning to conduct further PET studies in healthy subjects during sleep and memory consolidation, and in FrX subjects who can be studied awake or under an alternative sedating agent that does not alter rCPS in these subjects.</p>
<p>SNPM is also conducting quantitative autoradiographic studies in rodents in order to measure rCPS in animal models of Fragile X Syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), and other single gene disorders associated with a high incidence of autism. SNPM plans to conduct autoradiographic and small animal PET studies in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease. The animal studies are an integral part of the Section's research program: each animal study is the preamble to a planned clinical study, and each clinical study informs the next animal study.</p>
<p><br />The purpose of this requirement is to provide data analysis services for the SNPM PET and quantitative autoradiographic studies.</p>
<p>Specifically, for each PET or autoradiographic study, this requirement will provide data analysis to include: (1) Evaluation of measured input functions, including smoothing and/or error correction as necessary; (2) Transformation of PET data to align with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, and inverse transformation of MRI data to align with PET data as necessary;(3) Calculation of tissue time-activity curves (PET studies) or final tissue activity (autoradiographic studies) for all regions of interest to the Pl. Performance of data quality control, including examination of possible motion artifacts, coordination of additional reconstructions of the data if errors are found,<br />Performance of smoothing and/or error-correction as necessary; (4) Employment of a mathematical model to estimate all kinetic model parameters for the tracer in each region. Troubleshooting and correction of any problems that arise from ill-conditioned or outlier data; (5) Determination of rCPS for all regions of interest; and (6) Performance of other ad-hoc analyses as requested by the Government.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENT /INFORMATION SOUGHT<br />Interested parties are expected to review this notice to familiarize itself with the requirements of this project. Failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p>Respondents must provide, as part of their responses, clear and convincing documentation of their capability of providing the services specified in this notice <br />Respondents must provide a general overview of the respondents' opinions about the difficulty and /or feasibility of the potential requirement, and any information regarding innovative ideas or concepts.</p>

<p>The information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a small business social-economic set-aside, competitive or non-competitive method is possible, and to determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>ALL organizations with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 334516-ANALYTICAL LABORATORY INSTRUMENT MANUFACTURING with associated small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br />The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Neuroimmunology Branch/Neuroimmunological Diseases Unit, has a potential requirement for a Electrochemiluminescence Imager instrument used to develop new biomarkers that can have a diagnostic and prognostic role in the care of patients with neuroimmunological diseases. Previous research demonstrates that biomarkers in the blood do not reflect a situation in the intrathecal compartment. There is no correlation between biomarkers measured in the blood/serum/plasma and biomarkers measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The essential government features that need to be achieved in this potential requirement includes an instrument that enables multiplexed measurement using electrochemiluminescence for detection that are not reliant on beads or flow cells, as this reliance demands larger quanties of CSF samples than are currently deemed effiecient with the lab's current research practices. Instrument shall utilize electrochemiluminescence to detect binding events on patterned arrays.<br /> <br />The Neuroimmunological Diseases Unit (NDU) plays a central role in the scientific and technical context in the overall mission of NINDS.  The purpose of the potential requirement includes helping to study the mechanisms of immunoregulation in humans and mechanisms of tissue injury in neuroimmunological diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). NDU has identified the need in development of new biomarkers that can be used as diagnostic tests, as prognostic markers and for monitoring of therapeutic efficacy. Development of such biomarkers is one of the main goals of NDU research.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to correct the number of staples in one box from 5,000 to 5,040.<br /><br />This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-272-9662<br />Name:		Staples, Standard, Full Strip<br />Description:	Standard chisel point staples. Full strip, 210 staples per strip, 25-sheet capacity. 1/2" W x 1/4" L. UOI is BX. BX = 5040 staples.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p><br />NSN:			7510-00-272-9662<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	SWI35108; BOSSBS1914CP; UNV79000</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than January 8,, 2014 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>
