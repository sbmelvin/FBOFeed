<SOLNBR>4103
<RESPDATE>051905
<ARCHDATE>06182005
<CONTACT>Chris Gallagher, xxx
<DESC>The purpose of this market survey is to gauge interest in conducting training/workshops at the 9th Aging Aircraft Conference being held in Atlanta, Georgia, beginning Monday, 06 March 2006, at approximately 1PM and ending Thursday 09 March 2006.  Exact times will be established as the conference agenda matures (see website address below). This is not a solicitation for proposals, there is no competition involved and no Government contracts will be awarded in response to this market survey. The 9th Aging Aircraft Conference Committee (the Committee) wishes to explore the potential of arranging pre- and post- conference workshops for topics related to the conference subject matter.  To avoid any interference with the conference, workshops will be scheduled before and after the conference.  It is envisioned that the workshops can be conducted on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday morning prior to the conference, or on the Friday, Saturday, Sunday, proceeding the conference.  Specific length and days of the workshops will be determined by the offering firm. The conference addresses aging aircraft, continued airworthiness, fleet management issues, and associated research and engineering related to: 1.  Structures - Metallic and Composite. 2.  Aging Nonmetalic Materials - Science of Materials 3.  Corrosion 4.  Electrical Wiring Interconnect Systems (EWIS) 5.  Fleet Management 6.  Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS)/Obsolescence 7.  Dynamic Components 8.  Aging Nonstructural Systems (Mechanical Systems) 9.  Engines 10. Avionics The Committee believes that the workshop opportunities can provide a great benefit to conference participants.  The Committee desires to gather information on "possible" workshops before/after the conference.  The Aging Aircraft Conference sponsors are only facilitating the training opportunity via the conference website.  Select workshops will be posted on the conference website: http://www.agingaircraftconference.org/ A market survey is being conducted to gauge interest in this approach from any/all sources interested in the aforementioned training opportunity.  Interested parties shall provide a short (not more than 5 pages) description of the training to be offered.  This shall indicate which of the ten areas above the training is related to, and a description of how the training relates to the conference agenda.  Submittals shall also contain point-of-contact (POC) information including phone number and/or e-mail address.   The Committee shall review the submitted descriptions and for each, determine if the workshop is related to the conference agenda only.   The FAA and the Committee are seeking information only and will not be awarding a contract. Costs related to the workshops will be handled by the firm offering the workshop.  Any payment requirements will be up to the firm presenting the workshop.  The firm offering the workshop will make arrangements for meeting rooms, a/v support, etc., directly with the Hyatt Regency-Atlanta.  The 9th Aging Aircraft Conference will list the relevant workshops on it's website and provide a link and/or POC information for the associated workshop opportunity. The conference sponsors will not, in any way, provide financial support nor will they provide any guarantee of workshop attendance.  The conference sponsors shall not be liable for any damages or losses incurred should the conference or the proposed workshop be cancelled for any reason.  All payments for the workshops will be made directly to the firm offering the training by the attendees.  The Aging Aircraft Conference sponsors are only facilitating the training opportunity via the conference website and will not be awarding any Government contracts as a result of this market survey. All submittals in response to this market survey shall be sent via e-mail to Mr. Robert Pappas, AAR-480, at rob.pappas@faa.gov  Submittals for this training opportunity must be received no later than 19 May 2005 to be considered.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), has a requirement to perform a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled prospective phase II clinical study that will evaluate the effects of erythropoietin administration on infarct size and left ventricle (LV) remodeling in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarctions.  The Contractor shall be required to recruit and obtain a signed consent form, within a time period of approximately 15 months, from approximately 150 men and women with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarctions who are referred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for primary or rescue percutaneous coronary intervention.  The Contractor shall be required to perform, on all recruited subjects, contrast enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as early as possible after enrollment, but no later than 48-72 hours from the time of randomization.  The Contractor shall be required to repeat the contrast enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study on subjects approximately four to six months later.  For each MRI, the Contractor shall measure cardiac volumes, ejection fraction, left ventricular mass, and infarct size, and assess myocardial perfusion, to assess for changes in these variables and for the extent of infarct expansion.  The Contractor shall also collect blood, measuring a number of levels, including the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells in fresh blood samples (i.e. collected within approximately 4 hours of the test) at the time of enrollment into the study when feasible, and approximately 24-48 hours after administration of the study medication. The Contractor shall perform safety monitoring, including establishing a data and safety monitoring board.  Finally, the Contractor shall be required to perform detailed statistical analyses of all the test results.  It is estimated that a two (2) year, cost-reimbursement completion type contract will be awarded.  The following are mandatory qualification criteria that must be met at the time proposals are submitted:  The Offeror must have a cardiac catheterization laboratory that performs primary and rescue percutaneous coronary interventions; the Offeror must possess the necessary equipment and software to perform contrast enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; and, the Offeror must have access to a laboratory skilled in measuring circulating endothelial progenitor cells.

<DESC>Description:  Provide services and modifications to the AUTOLAB 1500 TRIAXIAL CORE FLOW UNIT. The U.S. Department of Energyâs National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to the New England Research Inc., White River Junction, VT for the following work: STATEMENT OF WORK - ITEM DESCRIPTION: Fund NEW ENGLAND RESEARCH, INC., (NER) to provide services and modifications to the AUTOLAB 1500 TRIAXIAL CORE FLOW UNIT under a Service Contract in order that extremely low permeability/storage measurements can be collected from coal core samples to determine the detailed analysis of the impacts of carbon sequestration. This also would include the development and implementation of a collaborative effort between NETL OSTA GSCFL and NER staff. THE INTENDED TASKS OF THE INITIATIVE ARE AS FOLLOWS: TASK 1.0 NER will modify their AutoLab 1500 unit at NETL OSTA by moving the appropriate pressure transducer(s) from outside the unitâs pressure vessel to the appropriate core holder (making 1.5 and 2.0 inch diameter core holders as low-permeability/storage core holders) inside the pressure vessel to increase the sensitivity of the permeability and core sample storage measurements for coal cores as the confining pressure increases from 10 MPa to 30 MPa. This is required to collect extremely low permeability measurements with liquid, and super-critical CO2, as well as gas phase CO2, methane, and possibly, helium in low porosity and expected low permeability core samples at a constant temperature. In addition, these modifications shall also provide for more accurate core sample storage measurements. All changes being made would allow for coal cores from 1.0 to 3.0 inches in length.  TASK 1.1 All core holders indicated in Item 1 above shall also be machined/modified to allow for NERâs velocity upgrade (indicated below) while allowing simultaneous experiments to be performed with the embedded pressure transducer for low permeability and storage measurements. NER personnel will provide a velocity upgrade by placing a velocity transceiver (axial propagation) in each of the newly fabricated/modified 1.5 and 2.0 inch core holders for the low-permeability/storage measurements, as indicated above. TASK 2.0 Accurate reduction of the experimental data to obtain permeability requires detailed information on the PVT (pressure, volume, and temperature) relationships for the pore fluid: liquid and super-critical CO2, gas phase CO2, methane, and helium. This information, the equation of state (EOS), will be programmed into the permeability software to facilitate automated data reduction. NER will work with NETL to define the EOS that will be incorporated into the software.  This involves the customization of the AutoLab processing based on the data already generated by NETL OSTA and modifications made by NER to collect accurately, the said parameters. The customization would include, but not be limited to: TASK 2.1 Pressure-time histories for the upstream and down stream pressure transducers. TASK 2.2 Downstream and core sample storage volume.     TASK 2.2.1 - Added data curves (s) to aid in determining the best storage volume(s). TASK 2.3 Printed statements below the appropriate data curves/graphs so the areas where possible problems are associated with poor storage and permeability measurements. TASK 2.4 The EOS of the pore fluid, while creating and installing a CO2 Porefluid file within the AutoLab software, which is based on the previous data collected by NETL OSTA. NER will work with NETL to develop the appropriate procedures. TASK 2.5 Prepare a Linx user friendly document to be utilized by NETL OSTA staff to perform specific procedures when downloading, transferring, utilizing, and processing collected data. TASK 3.0 NER shall provide a yearly service visit to (a) calibrate all the transducers (>20 different transducers) on the AutoLab 1500, (b) check the condition of the high pressure seals in the intensifiers and the pressure vessel and replace seals where necessary, and (c) update test procedures and train NETL staff on additional measurement techniques as required. This purchase order is being issued to New England Research Inc (NER) because they previously designed and built an AUTOLAB 1500, A TRIAXIAL APPARATUS FOR TWO-PHASE FLOW AND PERMEABILITY EXPERIMENTS for OSTA, with many novel and first ever experiments being performed by OSTA staff.  The experiments performed by OSTA staff with the said unit have provided the first ever permeability results on coal with liquid CO2 as the fluid.  Since these experiments and results have never been performed and obtained, respectively, before OSTA staff has determined that some unique modifications are required to the AutoLab 1500 unit in order to collect even more novel data so new coal characteristics related to CO2 sequestration can be determined.  Since NER has the extensive knowledge on the theory of the operations of core flow units for permeability, stress/strain relationships, and strength testing of reservoir rock, their services are required to make the modifications to the said unit at the NETL.  In addition, NETL OSTA GSCFL, staff requires NERâs expertise to aid in developing novel experiments while providing the detailed analysis regarding the impacts of CO2 sequestration on core samples.  All components being modified within the NER AutoLab 1500 Core Flow Unit within OSTA are proprietary to NER and NER only. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.  Offerors shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc., in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as meeting technical acceptability.  Therefore, no solicitation will result the announcement. This award shall be made using FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770. The Technical Representative for the above requirement is Ms. Thomas Brown, Phone 412-386-4691..  All bids, proposals, or quotations must be submitted by 5:00 PM Eastern Time, April 22, 2005.

<DESC>Proposals will be accepted from all business concerns for the DC PLH-14(3) Interstate 395 Signing Improvements Project.  Project documents will be available on or about April 22, 2005.  Proposals will be due on or about May 26, 2005 at the EFLHD in Sterling, Virginia.  Use internet address http://www2.efl.fhwa.dot.gov/Documents.aspx to check for availability of project documents.  All documents can be directly downloaded from this website.  Documents will no longer be mailed.

This project consists of correcting signage deficiencies on Interstate 395 (I-395), between the DC Jurisdictional Line on the 14th Street Bridge and New York Avenue, Washington, DC.  The primary project limits on I-395 in the 14th Street Bridge Corridor extend from the DC Jurisdictional line to Maine Avenue; and consists of installation, modification, removal and replacement of traffic signs (roadside and overhead), cantilever sign structures, and overhead sign bridges to meet the current standards and principles of the MUTCD for enhancing the safety of the traveling public.  Electrical connections, including conduit and wiring, will be needed at all new sign structure locations.  The secondary project limits on I-395 extend from Maine Avenue to New York Avenue and addresses over-height vehicle signing, for vehicles approaching and traveling in the National Mall tunnel.  Again these signs are proposed to meet the current standards and principles of the MUTCD.  Traffic control will be very important during construction of this project, and will most likely include night work.

The project is expected to fall within the price range of $1,000,000 to $5,000,000. 

Award will be made to an offeror whose technical submittal and price proposal contain the combination of the technical qualifications and price that offers the best value to the Government.  Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proof of acceptability rests with the offeror.     

Questions can be emailed to eflhd.contracts@fhwa.dot.gov.  Requests must include the solicitation number, project name and number, requesting firm and address, a point of contact and telephone number.

PLEASE NOTE
Background and Evaluation Criteria:  The Government will award to the lowest priced/technically acceptable responsible offeror.  The Contracting Officer will evaluate all proposals for technical acceptability. 

Note: Competing technical proposals will be evaluated against the solicitation requirements; they are not compared with each other. The technical factor described below will be rated on a pass/fail basis, and it must receive a passing score for an offeror's proposal to receive further consideration. Evaluating each responsive proposal and comparing the results of that evaluation against the technical requirements specified in this solicitation will determine technical acceptability.

Request for Proposal (RFP) Submittals:  Interested firms/teams will submit a proposal that is based on the evaluation criteria established in this notice.  Please submit pricing information in a separate envelope.


 
JOINT VENTURE (J/V) DOCUMENTATION HAS TO BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED PRIOR TO CONTRACT AWARD.

Evaluation Factors/Criteria:

Special Note:  Price and all technical factors are equal.  (50% Price and 50% technical)

(1) Price 
     
(2) Past performance, experience and technical competence:  List and describe 3 recent projects indicating past performance, experience and technical competence in similar signing projects.  In addition, provide a customer/owner point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address if available.  Within the last ten years, has your firm ever been, or proposed to be, suspended, debarred, or determined non-responsible, based upon an allegation of unsatisfactory performance or fraud? Within the last ten years, has your firm ever had a contract terminated for any reason either as a prime or subcontractor?  This also applies to a partner in a joint venture. Within the last ten years, has your firm ever filed a claim relative to the construction of a roadway facility for (1) a default termination, (2) the imposition of liquidated damages, (3) a termination for convenience that adversely affected your firm, or (4) any damages caused by the owners determination that you did not perform in a timely, safe, or contractual manner.

The Government will review and evaluate each firms (offeror) documented past performance and will rate them as acceptable or unacceptable.  By acceptable past performance, the Government means that the offeror has a good reputation for satisfying its customers and delivering quality work in a timely manner at a reasonable cost.  Acceptable past performance also means the firm has a reputation of integrity, reasonable and cooperative conduct, and commitment to customer satisfaction.  In reviewing and evaluating an offerors past performance, the Government will consider information obtained from the firm, and may consider information obtained from other sources.  This includes past and present customers and their current and former employees, past and present subcontractors and their current and former employees, current and former employees of the firm, federal, state and local government agencies (including court records), and private consumer protection organizations.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to provide information on problems encountered on identified contracts and annotate the firms corrective action taken.  The Government will evaluate past performance information and will rate the firms as pass or fail.  In the event that a firm does not have a record of relevant past performance, or information on past performance is not available, the firm will not be evaluated favorable or unfavorably on this technical evaluation factor.  Rather the offeror will be given a neutral rating. 

In accordance with FAR clause 252.215-1, Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition (MAR 2001), the Government will award after evaluations are completed, unless the Contracting Officer determines that discussions are necessary.

Due to changes in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) that adds the Annual Representations and Certifications FAR 52.204-8 (Jan 2005), the Representations and Certifications must be filled-in online at http://orca.bpn.gov/.  The required Annual Form Vets-100 must also be filled-in online at http://vets100.cudenver.edu  per FAR 52.222-37.

<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) in Woods Hole, MA has a requirement for fishery observer services. The Contractor shall collect scientific, management, regulatory compliance and economic data at sea through interviews of vessels captains and crew, observations of fishing operations, measurements of selected portions of the catch and fishing gear and collection of samples. Data collected includes data on the vessel, crew, fishing practices and cost of operation. This data is necessary for the management of fisheries occurring in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the high seas beyond the EEZ. The work requires deploying trained NEFSC certified observers to meet coverage levels prescribed in sea day schedules developed by NMFS/NEFSC.  NEFSC will train the contractors observers once the contract is awarded as needed and at the Governments expense.  The Contractor shall support, as specified, the observers during each phase of their employment period, including training, briefing, travel, accomplishing requisite land duties, data collection on fishing vessels, and debriefings. The Contractor shall provide all necessary logistical and administrative support to deploy observers to ports from which fishing vessels depart. This includes making travel arrangements, providing travel advances for observers, reimbursing vessel operators for observer meals, and reimbursing observers for travel expenses. Vessels operate out of ports from North Carolina to Maine in ocean waters, 3-200 miles offshore in all weather conditions. Typically, trips are 1- 5 days in duration. Vessels are generally 30-100 feet in length. Crew members and observers live and sleep in close quarters, often in damp conditions and share common facilities. Because of the size of the vessels, motion sickness can be debilitating for some individuals. Observers must be willing to travel occasionally to cover locations other than their home ports.  The Government estimates 12,000 sea days per year.  The Government anticipates award of a firm fixed price indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract.  The contract award date is anticipated to be October 1, 2005 with a period of performance of five (5) years thereafter.

The estimated due date for proposals is June 14, 2005.  A preproposal conference and site visit will be conducted at NEFSC Woods Hole, MA on or about May 17, 2005.  The basis for proposal evaluation will include, in descending order of importance:  Technical Requirements, Past Performance, Corporate Experience, and Key Personnel, and technical, when combined, is significantly more important than price.  This procurement is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The applicable NAICS code for this acquisition is 541990 with a size standard of $6 million.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Patuxent River intends to issue a contract to Integrated Systems Solutions, Inc. (ISSI) to includes a sole source CLIN.  The contract will be awarded under Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N00421-04-R-0097 for research and development of various Lighter Than Air (LTA) requirements, including command and control (C2), intelligence gathering, and integration between various platforms and their mission systems.  The sole source CLIN would use O&M funds and cover the evaluation of the potential of LTA platforms in a fleet environment, facilitation of the exchange of sensor and communication hardware from fleet Heavier Than Air (HTA) platforms and squadrons, and the insertion of various concepts of operation into the Joint National Training Network.   The sole source CLIN will allow for the use of O&M funds on a contract awarded under a BAA.  As the work being performed is proprietary to ISSI, the portion to be paid for with O&M funds cannot be given to another vendor, and ISSI is therefore considered the only responsible source capable of satisfying agency requirements.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U. S. Army Tank-automotive and Armament Command, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey, has a requirement for the automatic and emergency delivery of propane  gas, to maintain/repair propane fuel distribution equipment and to  maintain/repair propane cooking and heating appliances, including the replacement of parts, at various locations at Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey. The contracting officer is contemplating issuing a blanket purchase agreement on a sole-source basis to Synergy Gas Company, 3129 Route 46 Parsippany, NJ 07054, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302- 1, because Synergy has equipment currently installed at various locations on the installation and award to any other source would result in costly removal and installation of new equipment and an unacceptable interruption of service. The period of performance is planned to be three years, which may include one or more options.  Individual BPA calls will not exceed the simplified  acquisition threshold.  The aggregate of all potential calls is estimated not to exceed $180,000.  The quantity of propane to be delivered is expected to decrease over the three-year period.  Award is anticipated in April, 2005.  See Note 22.

A planning charrette is a fully collaborative, on-site, intensive project-planning workshop w ith broad participation by the users, installation organizations,  and other interested organizations to obtain concensus on project requirements, scope and cost.   B.  Purpose.  The planning charrette is an intensive 1-5 day effort to develop project requ irements and documentation in support of the Military Construction programming process which identify and resolve issues of standardization, functionality, location, scope, and cost which might otherwise affect execution of the project.  When executed prop erly, the planning charrette will help produce high quality project documentation and reliable budget cost estimates culminating in a completed DD Form 1391.  C.  Process.  The planning charrette team will validate the facility requirements, prepare the pr oject scope, site plan and cost estimate during an intensive workshop at the installation rather than doing an information gathering site visit and then completing the work back at the office.  Preparing the cost estimate on site affords team members bes t available information.  The A/E or the installation personnel will develop a conceptual site layout so that site quantities can be determined and related costs developed.  The A/E will develop conceptual floor plans and functional layouts.  Special use a reas within the primary facility must be identified and accounted for within the cost estimate.  Some follow up work will be required following the A/E charrette decision brief to the installation commander or representative, but the technical products wil l be essentially complete at the conclusion of the charrette.  D.  Tasks.  (1)  Pre-Charrette Requirements:  To maximize the benefits from and minimize the cost of a planning charrette, installation personnel must determine/resolve some of the project requ irements prior to the charrette, such as the following:  a.  Site selection should be complete and approved, when possible, by the Installation Planning Board (or equivalent).  b.  User requirements (square feet or meters of office space, etc.) and special  needs should be determined and verified by the Directorate of Public Works (DPW)/ Installation Management Agency (IMA)/ Major Command (MACOM) (or others as necessary) prior to the planning charrette.  At a minimum, a user questionnaire or survey should be  completed prior to the charrette to identify as much as possible about the functional requirements of the proposed facility.   (2)  Prepare Full DD Form 1391.  A DD Form 1391 with supporting documentation shall be prepared by the A/E with assistance from installation personnel.  a.  Method.  Data gathering, interviews (phone and in-person), document review, and regulatory guidance review are the methods used. Several organizations will need to be represented at the charrette.  Representatives must be empow ered to provide authoritative input to the planning process.  The MACOM and IMA-Region project managers are an important resource for the charrette team and can furnish (or obtain) guidance and insight into the proper project requirements that are necessar y for development of the scope and cost associated with the DD-1391 programming document.  b.  The Charrette Team Members.  The make up of the charrette team wi ll depend on the functional requirements of the project.    The team members may include the following:  1)  MACOM Project Manager (PM) (Command Level Proponent); 2)  IMA North East Region PM; 3)  United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Major Subordi nate Command (MSC) representative; 4)  Installation personnel (at a minimum):  Users/Proponent  (to define requirement); DPW Project Manager; Director of Housing; Director of Community Activities; Real Property Master Planning; Environmental Directorate; D irectorate of Information Management  Exterior and Interior; Provost Marshal (or representative)  Force Protection; Fire Marshal (or representative)  Fire Code Requirements; Safety Officer; Installation utilities personnel (electrical, water, sewer and gas); Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) for non-official telephone service; Airfield Ops; Others as desired or required.

Project Manager  acts as the planning  charrette facilitator; plan, schedule, and manage the charrette process including: development of a schedule and agenda in coordination with all parties involved; presents decision brief to installation command representative; b.  Cost Engineer - The cost  engineer will prepare a project cost estimate for the entire project using software (PC-COST (preferred), PACES,  and/or MCACES,) authorized for use by DOD agencies. Line items and their related costs for all the site preparation and utility costs should be based on site specific information and be developed within MCACES or PC-COST.  The total project cost estimate (from which a DD1391 can be developed) will be provided in electronic format suitable for use by PC-COST and uploaded  directly into the PAX 1 391 Processor.  If MCACES is used, the cost estimate must be structured in the ENG 3086 format suitable for electronic import into PC-COST; c.  PAX Operator The PAX operator will input the project into the DD-1391 processor module of the PAX system.  This person is responsible for electronic input or corrections to the DD-1391 form; d.  Planner.  The planner is responsible for writing the various paragraphs required within the DD-1391.  When the installation has standard type paragraphs available, the pla nner must obtain these and either edit the paragraph to fit the current project or write a new paragraph.  Finished paragraphs will be given to the PAX operator for input into the DD-1391.  The USACE PM and PAX Operator will function as planners; and e.

More than one firm will be selected from this announcement; and it is anticipated that two contracts will be awarded.  One of the selections will be reserved for 8(a) Program Concerns; the other is unrestricted and open to all interested parties regardless of business size.  Responses to this announcement will be accepted from all responsible firms, regardless of business size.  However, eligibility for the first award will be based on the cascading order of precedence as described below.  The second award will be made on an unrestricted basis.  The cascading order of precedence for award of the first contract is:  1st  consideration:  8(a) Program; 2nd  consideration:  Unrestri cted.  The Government will use the following methodology to establish eligibility for contract award using the cascading order of precedence:  In addition to the other information required to be submitted, each firm responding to this announcement as an 8( a) Program participant must indicate their size status under the specified NAICS code and must also state if they are currently certified as an 8(a) small business concern.  Unless specifically stated otherwise, the Government will presume that all 8(a) sm all business concerns desire to compete for an award under the 8(a) Program.  Unless specifically stated otherwise, the Government will also presume that all 8( a) small business concerns desire to compete for an award for the Unrestricted contract.  All 8 (a) business concerns receiving an award under the 8(a) Program set-aside will be subject to FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  Initially the Govern ment will only evaluate the qualifications of the A-E firms which have stated that they are competing for the award under the authority of the 8(a) Program.  The first of two awards resulting from this announcement will be made on a competitive basis to an  eligible 8(a) business concern, provided that a minimum of three of the competing 8(a) A-E firms are determined to be highly qualified (e.g., are short-listed) and that the Government is able to negotiate a fair market price with one of the short-listed f irms.  If responses are not received from at least three eligible 8(a) firms that are considered by the Government to be highly qualified for this procurement, or if the Government is not able to successfully negotiate a fair market price with one of the h ighly qualified 8(a) firms, then this procurement will be automatically withdrawn from the 8(a) Program and the acquisition will be conducted on an unrestricted basis.  No one A-E Contractor will receive both awards.  No contract will be awarded later than  one year after the date that the responses to this synopsis are due.  If more than one contract is awarded as a result of this announcement for the same or similar work, selection for task order awards will be made as follows:  (1) All awardees will be gi ven a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order award in excess of $2,500.  (2) In making selection of the awardee to receive a specific task order, the Contracting Officer will consider past performance of previous task orders, quality of prev ious task orders, timeliness of previous task orders, cost control, the firms strengths and previous experience in relation to the work requirements and geographic locations described in the scope of work for each task order.  Details of the selection pro cess will be included in the resultant contracts.  Indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts will be negotiated and the first is anticipated to be awarded in August 2005.  Task Orders will be Firm Fixed Price.  If awarded under the 8(a) Program, t he contract will be for a one-year period not-to-exceed $250,000 for the basic year and two one-year options, each not-to-exceed $250,000 each.  The unrestricted contract(s) will be for a one-year period not-to-exceed $250,000 for the basic year and two on e-year options, not-to-exceed $250,000 each year.  Individual task orders shall not exceed the annual contract amount.  The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.  At the discretion of the Government, the option years may be exercise d early if the Total Estimated Price is exhausted or nearly exhausted.  All pricing schedules (for base year and all option periods) will be effective for one full year regardless of the early exercising of options, beginning with the date of award of the base year.  The pricing schedules for the first through second option periods become effective on the first through second anniversary dates, respectively, of the contract award.  If the Total Estimated Price of the base year or any option year is not awar ded within that years 12-month performance period and the Government has elected to exercise a subsequent option year, the remaining used dollar amount may be added on to the Total Estimate Price of the option period being exercised.  All interested Archi tect-Engineers are reminded that in accordance with the provisions of FAR Sections 19.7, 52.219-8, 52.219-9 or equivalent DFARS Sections, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performanc e of this contract, with small and small disadvantaged business.  If a large business is selected for this contract, it will be required to submit a detailed su bcontracting plan at a later date.  A detailed plan is not required to be submitted with the SF 330, however, the plans to do so should be specified in block H of the SF 330.  If a large business is selected, it must comply with FAR 52-219.9 regarding the requirement to subcontract.  Sacramento Districts recommended goal for work intended to be subcontracted is 50.9% for small business.  The goal further states that of the 50.9% to be subcontracted to small business, 8.8% is for small disadvantaged busines s (subset to small business). 7.2% is for small business/woman owned (subset to small business), 2.9% for HUBZone small business (subset to small business) and 0.5% is for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small business (subset to small business).  If the se lected firm submits a plan with lesser goals, it must submit written rationale of why the above goals are not met.  Firms should indicate personnel and subcontractors selected to work on the contract and state their management structure.  To be eligible fo r contract award a firm or joint venture must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).

<DESC>This ad was previously posted on March 24, 2005 and modified on March 28, 2005.  This modified ad is listed in its entirety with corrections to the minimum requirements numbering and the email address for Debra Schmaus and telephone no. The United States Postal Service (USPS), Great Lakes Facilities Service Office (GLFSO), is seeking interest from General Contractors to prequalify for one or more Indefinite Quantity Construction Contracts (IQCC)/Job Order Contracts (JOC) for repair and alteration projects within the State of Michigan Area which include:  See below Areas and Counties.  The term of the contract will be for one year, with four possible one-year renewal options.  The maximum aggregate amount under the contracts will not exceed $9.5 million dollars.  The contract renewal option may be exercised at the discretion of the USPS Contracting Officer.  The minimum work ordered during the contract period, including any renewal options, will not be less than $10,000.

A JOC is an indefinite quantity construction contract pursuant to which the contractor will perform a series of individual projects at different Postal Service facilities.  Prequalified contractors will propose a Contract Multiplier and Premium Time Multiplier to be applied to a Unit Price Schedule.  Contractor agrees that the Contractor Multiplier and/or the Premium Time Multiplier under this contract, when used in determining the total amount of the work order, includes all profit, overhead, bonds, insurance and other contingencies, over and above the direct costs of construction.  Regular working hours are between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.  Work ordered during premium time, as directed by a specific detailed scope of work, will be paid at the contracted Premium Time Multiplier.  The multiplier submitted by the offeror must not be more than four decimal places (e.g. 1.2222 or 0.9700).  This multiplier will apply to each unit price in the Unit Price Schedule.  

General Contractors must meet the following minimum requirements to apply:  (1) your firm must have an office located within the State of Michigan and must be willing and able to perform work on all projects that may occur within any of the geographical areas.  If the office is NOT the main or home office for the company, contractor must furnish the address of the office and the phone number.  Contractor must submit a staffing chart and describe the duties and experience of the employees for that office.  If the contractor does not have an office located within the preferred area, the contractor must furnish information on how the company will administer the contract from their office outside of the preferred.  (2) You are expected to possess and provide a copy of a valid contractors license(s) for the areas specified, or provide a copy of the application to obtain such license(s) in the state(s) listed in the geographical area; (3) your firm must provide proof of bonding with a minimum aggregate dollar amount of $2,500,000; (4) your firm must have been in business, under the firms present name, for a minimum of five (5) consecutive years.

Contractors will be evaluated on the information provided in the Contractor Qualification Statement which includes financial capability, experience and safety.  You must provide the required financial information stated in the prequalification package.  The Contractors Qualification Statements will be evaluated by a U.S.P.S. Committee, and only the most qualified contractors will be pre-qualified.  Minority-owned and Women-owned Business participation is encouraged.

Contractor Qualification Statement packages are available free of charge and may be obtained by written request to Debra Schmaus, USPS, GLFSO, 62 Stratford Drive, Bloomingdale, IL  60117-7000 or by email, debra.l.schmaus@usps.gov.  Ms. Schmaus telephone number is 630-295-6297.  Provide your email address and the qualification statement will be sent to you electronically.

<DESC>This is an amendment to the previous announcement dated March 2, 2005.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is leading the national effort to revise the 1996 Guidelines for the Death Scene Investigation of Sudden, Unexplained Infant Death and the Sudden, Unexplained Infant Death Investigation Report Form (SUIDIRF).  The SUIRDIF is used nationally by states, counties and local jurisdictions on a voluntary basis to gather information about the circumstances surrounding sudden, unexplained infant deaths (SUIDS).  The SUIRDF is important because it provides a standardized system for the death scene investigation of SUIDS.  Lack of such standardization results in inaccurate diagnosis and reporting of the cause of death and thus hinders the ability to monitor trends in SUIDS, conduct meaningful research, and monitor programs aimed at preventing SUIDS.  To improve the diagnosis and reporting of SUIDS in the US, all death scene investigators need to have access to and familiarity with the form, as well as training on how to conduct the a SUIDS death scene investigation.  Therefore, the CDC, Maternal and Infant Health Branch (MIHB) is seeking the services of an experienced contractor to train coroners, medical examiners and all of those involved with infant death scene investigations to conduct and infant death scene investigation using the revised SUIRDF and related training material.  However, to the best of our knowledge, only Occupational Research and Assessment (ORC), Inc. located in 124 Elm Street, Big Rapids, MI  49307 is knowledgeable with the revised SUIDIRF.  The revised SUIRDF was created in 2004 by a national committee.  ORC already developed a curriculum for training materials with the new form and for infant death scene protocol.  We intend to award a contract to ORC on the basis of sole source. However, any interested party who believes to have the capability to provide the training required by this RFP may reply submit an expression of interest via e-mail to Bbiltz@cdc.gov  or may send a proposal in response to the solicitation.   All responsible sources  will be considered.  The tentative solicitation issue date is 4/18/2005.  The solicitation will be available for downloading at the FedBiz Opps website when issued. No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed. PLEASE SUBMIT ALL INQUIRIES ONLY BY E-MAIL.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.  The NAICS codes is 541710 and the small business size standard is $6 million.  It is your responsibility to keep up with additional postings regarding the RFO on the FedbizOpps website.

<DESC>UPDATE 07 April 2005:  An updated draft RFP has been posted in the Bidders Library at the end of this announcment.  The purpose is to pass on the  incremental changes that have been incorporated in the document.   The biggest change in the draft is the increased emphasis on the early  delivery of a capability.  We have identified additional FY 05 funds and have  raised the first year of the funding profile from $1.5M to $2M.  There are  significant changes in the OCI clause.  It is recommended that you give the  RFP a careful review due to the number of small changes. The following attachments to the RFP have been updated as well:  CDRL Exhibit  A, CDRL Exhibit B, Attachment 1 (SOO), Attachment 2 (Section L), Attachment 3  (Section M), and Attachment 4 (TCP) and the DD 254. UPDATE 25 March 2005:  The Airborne Electronic Attack Squadron (AEASS) cannot  release the B-52 SOJ RFP until final approval of the acquisition strategy  and  the source selection plan.  We anticipate that may take another two weeks.  In  the interim, we plan to post an updated draft in the next few days to pass on  the incremental changes that have been incorporated in the document.   The biggest change in the draft is the increased emphasis on the early  delivery of a capability.  We have identified additional FY 05 funds and have  raised the first year of the funding profile from $1.5M to $2M.  There are  significant changes in the OCI clause.  It is recommended that you give the  RFP a careful review due to the number of small changes. As you are aware, we have been on a very aggressive schedule.  The delays we  are experiencing put our contract award schedule at risk.  We are requesting  your cooperation in helping us make up some schedule time by reducing the  number of days required for proposal preparation.  If you plan to bid this  program, request you provide the PCO feedback on the acceptability of reducing  the number of days for proposal submission from 45 days to a lesser number,  and identify the minimum time you believe is required.  Request your response  by 1 April 2005.  When a go-ahead is received from SAF/AQ and OSD, the AEASS  will determine the proposal due date and adjust the expected contract award  date accordingly.  UPDATE 22 March 2005:  A new attachment with the title of Questions and  Answers has been added to the document library below. UPDATE 21 March 2005:  Proposal due date information is changed as follows:   If the RFP is not released by 1 April 2005, there will be a day for day slip  in the proposal due date.   Also, information about the Past Performance volume due date is changed to  read as follows: Each offeror is requested to submit the Past Performance volume for relevant  Government contracts 28 days prior to the date established for receipt of  proposals.  Failure to submit early proposal information (Past Performance  volume) will not result in offeror disqualification.  Offerors are requested  to notify the PCO when the Past Performance volume is anticipated to be  submitted. UPDATE 9 March 2005 (Second update for this date):  RFP release is delayed  pending completion of the Government+s review/approval process.  Tentative  date for release is now 25 March 2005, in which case proposals will be due by  10 May 2005. However, the Past Performance Volume will be due by 15 Apr 2005.   The Government still plans to award the contract by the end of July 2005. Section L - Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors is modified by  making the following change to Table 3.1 Proposal Organization in Paragraph  3.1.5.2, Organization, Number of Copies, and Page Limits.  The maximum page  limit for Vol III, Past Performance, is now 60 pages.  Within those 60 pages,  there should be no more than 5 pages per each past contract. UPDATE 9 March 2005:  The briefings and documents promised at the B-52 Stand- off Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference on 16 Feb 2005 are now available for  distribution.  There are two CDs available for distribution.  The first CD  (unclassified) was mailed on 7 Mar 05 to each company /office that attended  the conference.  The second CD (classified) is available for local  representatives of any company which attended the conference to pick up.   Dayton representatives from these companies are encouraged to pick up the  classified CDs on the afternoon of 11 March from security representatives at  Bldg 556.  In order to identify the individual who is picking up the CD,  please fax a visit request to the following address:   ASC/LRS-SF (ATTN: Carol Golden) 2690 Loop Road West, Bldg 556, WPAFB OH 45433-7148 Fax: 937-656-4612 Phone: 937-656-5163 If a Dayton representative is not available, the classified CDs will be mailed  to attendees who requested them.

In addition, a second classified CD containing historical documentation is  available for those companies who have indicated they plan to bid as an LSI.   These companies can request this additional CD by calling Stephanie Shelley (937-656-5037) to justify the need to know. UPDATE 8 March 05:  Section L - Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to  Offerors is hereby amended to change the font requirement for graphics only.   Paragraph 3.1.5.6, Page Size and Format, is changed as follows: For tables, charts, graphs and figures, the font shall be no smaller than 8  point. Also, paragraph 3.1.5.5, Page Limitations, is revised by adding the following  sentence:   	Offerors may attach an Executive Summary of no more than 4 pages to  their transmittal letter.  Neither will be considered in the overall page  count nor will they be evaluated. UPDATE 2 March 05:	Limited Access to a B-52H aircraft for potential  bidders for the Lead Systems Integrator (LSI) Purpose:  The government shall provide potential bidders limited access to a B- 52H aircraft as part of the B-52 RFP process for a Lead Systems Integrator  (LSI) for the Pre-Systems Development and Demonstration phase of the B-52  Stand Off-Jammer program.

The website to register for the B-52  Stand-off Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson  AFB on 16  17 Feb 2005 is located at the following address: www.usasymposium.com/b52h B-52H Standoff Jammer The B-52 Systems Squadron, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is preparing to issue a  Request for Proposal (RFP)for a Lead System Integrator for the pre-Systems  Design and Development (pre-SDD) phase of the B-52 Standoff Jammer (SOJ) Program.  This announcement is being posted to provide information about the  program to prospective bidders.  Questions may be submitted to the points of  contact listed at the bottom of this announcement.  We will update this  announcement by posting the questions and our responses in a Bidders Library  that will be placed at the end of this announcement.  This acquisition involves data that are subject to export control laws and  regulations.  It has been determined that foreign companies will not be  permitted to participate in this acquisition at the prime contract level.   Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics  Services Center (DLSC) +http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/+ and have a legitimate  business purpose may participate in this solicitation. Contact the Defense  Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan  40917-3084 (1-800-352-3572) for further information on the certification  process. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military  Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal. REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of a Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD)  contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for  a Lead System Integrator in the July 2005 timeframe.  This Lead System  Integrator must possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be Lead  System Integrator of the B-52 SOJ component of the Airborne Electronic Attack  (AEA) System of Systems (SoS) for use by United States Air Force (USAF)  personnel.  The nature of this effort will require access to SECRET or higher  and NOFORN material.   Background The B-52 SOJ will be a core component of the AEA System of Systems.  Other key  AEA components are anticipated to include a jammer variant of the Miniature  Air Launched Decoy (MALD), EC-130H with enhanced jamming pods (Compass Call),  inherent EA capability of Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA) on board  F/A-22s, F-35s, and other AESA-equipped aircraft, the Navy+s EA-6B Improved  Capability III (ICAP III) and EA-18G, and the network/protocols to link these  capabilities.  Some of the key technologies that will be involved include, but  are not limited to: sensitive accurate direction finding Radio Frequency (RF)  receivers, high power relatively broad band directional RF transmitters,  appropriate command and control and on-scene (local) electronic attack (EA)  asset management functions, line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight networking,  and advanced electronic warfare techniques generation and integration.  A  detailed overview of the B-52 SOJ will be presented at the B-52 Stand-off  Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson AFB on 16   17 Feb 2005.  Additional information for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will  be added to this site as soon as possible.  Further data can be obtained from  the points of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement. Current Environment Concept refinement of the AEA SoS and, in turn, B-52 SOJ, is in process.  An  AEA Analysis of Alternatives was completed in 2001 and forms the basis for  overall AEA capability requirements.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)  for AEA was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in Nov 2004.   The B-52H, in its fourth decade of operational service, provides the country  with immediate nuclear and conventional global power projection. There are  presently 93 aircraft in service, operating from two Main Operating Bases  (Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB) with the exception of two stationed at Edwards  AFB for flight testing.  Several modifications are underway or planned for the  B-52H to increase or sustain its capabilities.  A key requirement of the SOJ  is that it shall not degrade any current capabilities on the B-52H.  In  addition, the SOJ design and modification will need to be integrated with  other on-going B-52H modifications.   Contract Descriptions The objective for award of the pre-SDD contract is fourth quarter FY05.   The  approximately 2-year period of performance would include identifying and  evaluating existing technologies and associated suppliers needed to meet SOJ  requirements; reducing the risk or developing a plan for managing the risk  associated with those technologies in SDD; assisting the Air Force in planning  for SDD (including developing spiral development strategies, if applicable)  and accomplishing B-52 SOJ Milestone B (approval for entry into the SDD  phase), and other related tasks.   The Lead System Integrator will be expected to develop and execute a best  value strategy to manage the risks associated with selecting, integrating, and  sustaining SOJ components of varying technological maturity into a cohesive,  scalable/expandable B-52 subsystem.  The Government will require insight into  the integrating contractors subcontract and vendor selection process and  decision methodology.  The integrating contractor will be expected to execute,  in partnership with the Air Force, a robust systems engineering process that  includes subcontractors and vendors and to perform all planning necessary to  be able to field and sustain the SOJ capability following its development.   The SOJ capability will complement and shall not degrade the aircrafts strike  (both nuclear and non-nuclear) capabilities.  Full weapons carriage capability  shall be maintained.  Lastly, it is recognized that because of the B-52  experience and expertise that the Boeing Co. (the B-52 OEM) has built up over  the years, that its involvement will be necessary.  Thus, the Lead System  Integrator will be expected to interface with the Boeing Company or provide a  realistic plan describing how the bidder would accomplish the objectives of  the program without a Boeing interface.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO EXTEND THE CLOSING DATE AND TIME FOR THE RECEIPT OF OFFERS.

This synopsis is a duplicate posting of the original synopsis posted under N00189-04-R-0005.  As Amendment 1 to the previous synopsis indicated, the Solicitation is proceeding under the current reference number, which is N00189-05-R-0004.

_________________________________________________________________
The government intends to negotiate and award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Time and Material (T&M) pricing provisions for engineering and analytical support services for the operational testing and evaluation (OT&E) of aircraft as required by the Commander, Naval Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR).  This requirement will be solicited utilizing full and open competition.  The solicitation and resulting contract will be for one base year and three additional one-year option periods.  The main testing squadron supported by this acquisition will be Air Test and Evaluation Squadron NINE (VX-9).  The scope of this acquisition includes engineering and technical support for all phases of OT&E.  OT&E may be divided up into early involvement, OT&E planning, OT&E execution, OT&E reporting, and in-service monitoring phases.  The OT&E phases may be generally described as follows:  
* Early Involvement: This is the earliest OT&E phase of a program, and typically begins more than one year prior to the first scheduled OT&E event.  Tasks and deliverables during this phase focus on planning and resourcing future OT&E, and coordination with DT&E (Developmental Test and Evaluation).
* OT&E Planning:  This includes preparation for an OT&E phase of a program that will typically occur within one year.  Tasks and deliverables during this phase center on detailed test planning and scheduling.  DT&E coordination continues.
* OT&E Execution:  This includes executing the actual OT&E.  Tasks during this phase focus on scheduling, coordination, briefing, participation in, and debriefing test events.  Deliverables focus on data collection and anomaly reporting.
* OT&E Reporting.  This phase of OT&E centers on drafting the OT&E report after completion of the testing.  This phase is time limited.  Tasks include data collection and analysis.  The draft final report deliverable is the contractor's prime focus during this phase.
* In-Service Monitoring.  This optional phase occurs after OT&E is completed, reported, and the tested system is fielded.  COMOPTEVFOR and VX-9 may determine a need exists to situate an analyst on-site with a fleet unit employing a system VX-9 recently completed testing on.  Tasks focus on monitoring the performance of the fielded system.  Deliverables include anomaly reports and drafts standard USN/USMC deficiency reports.

The RLEP has decided there is no need for accelerometers on the LRO mission.  The RFI response does not need to include information about accelerometers. 3. Performance numbers for Angular Random Walk, Bias, Scale Factor, and Angular White Noise are three sigma values (standard deviation of three). 4. Bias performance value should be 3.6 deg/hour not 0.06 deg/hour.   The bias is still 0.001 deg/sec. 5. The RFI response date has been changed to later than 5:00 PM EST April 29, 2005.

<DESC>The Air Force Medical Service is seeking sources to perform referral management and tracking services in military medical treatment facilities at 44 geographically-dispersed stateside Air Force Bases (AFBs) and overseas locations (England, Italy), and potentially 22 other stateside and European bases.  The service is known as the AFMS Referral Management Center (RMCs). A Referral Management Center (RMC) is a One-Stop Shop where patients go to process specialty referrals requested by their Primary Care Managers (PCM).   The work is to establish RMCs at each MTF, staffed with registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and administrative personnel to manage and track all referrals generated by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and to interface with the TRICARE Managed Care Support Contractor (MCSC), other MTFs, and government healthcare organizations (e.g. VA), with regards to referrals.

Referral Management (RM) is a process for managing and tracking patient referrals, both internal and external to the medical treatment facility (MTF), and Right of First Refusal (ROFR) requests in order to identify trends, recapture care, and promote continuity of care.  It provides a mechanism for determining patient access to specialty clinics, Durable Medical Equipment (DME), and network inpatient admissions based on standardized criteria and pre-determined clinical/business outcomes.  The RMC executes its specialty referral processes in accordance with the standardized AFMS R&A Business Rules.  Under T-Nex, MTFs must meet the goals they projected in their MTF  Business Plans.  Recapturing specialty patient care from the private sector is a key AFMS strategy to maximize the MTFs specialty care capability while at the same time recapturing specialty care being done in the private sector, which could be done in the MTF or Direct Care system.  

Background:  We are seeking small and 8(a) business sources as part of market research to ascertain the interest, capability, experience, and capacity that small businesses possess to meet the complexity and magnitude in scope of performingto   referral management services at 44 stateside MTFs and two overseas locations (England and Italy) and potentially 22 additional MTFs.  If you are an interested small business or 8(a) source, please describe your ability to meet the following minimum mandatory requirements:
Past/current experience in staffing registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and administrative personnel at multiple stateside and European locations.  State number of states and which countries
Past/current capability to staff the above skill sets within 60 days of contract award.   Describe percentage staffed by 60 days of contract.  (For example, RNs hired at 80% by 60 days of contract award).  
Past/current ability to minimize turnover of hired staff at multiple locations.
Past/current ability to replace staff within two-three business days on short or no notice with trained and qualified personnel. 
Past/current ability/processes to manage personnel at multiple stateside locations and meet quality requirements of contract. Provide the name, phone number, and email address of a company representative we may contact for additional information.

If you are a small business, please identify your firm as such, together with any subcategory that applies (e.g., small disadvantaged business, 8a, HUB Zone small business, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business).  Emailed responses are preferred but paper submittals are acceptable.  The capability statement shall not exceed five (5) pages, typed, double spaced, single sided, pages (minimum 1 margins all around).

Send your Statement of Capability (SOC)to the following POC no later than close of business 1630 EDT, 18 April 05.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. POINT OF CONTACT (S):       Contracting: Mr. J. D. Martin, NSWC Crane, e-mail LogR&D@navy.mil, 812-854-3723.      Technical: Mr. A. Hawkins, NSWC Crane, e-mail LogR&D@navy.mil, 812-854-4160. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC Crane) mission is to Provide engineering and industrial base support of weapon systems, subsystems, equipments, and components with principal emphasis on industrial and product engineering associated with surface warfare systems in the areas of electronics, ordnance, pyrotechnic microwave technology, small arms, and surface ship electronic warfare in-service engineering. NSWC Crane is conducting research and development (R&D) for Industrial Capabilities in Logistics, Maintenance, and Manufacturing Technologies in support of our nations warfighters for the Defense Logistics Agency, the Marine Corps Logistics Command, the Naval Supply Systems Command, and other DoD commands. This R&D is being done under the Surface Warfare Logistics and Maintenance Product Area for Performance Based Logistics, Maintenance Engineering and Fleet Material Management in the areas of Supply Chain Management; Weapon System Sustainment; Logist! ics Research Networks; Competitive Sustainment; Strategic Distribution and Reutilization; Material Acquisition; Electronic Commerce; and other areas of Logistics and Manufacturing Technology R&D.  NSWC Crane is interested in receiving proposals for R&D in the afore mentioned areas for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding in these specific areas. Proposals may be based on fundamental research and development; concept formulation; assessment of system and subsystem requirements and processes; development, analysis and evaluation of concepts, systems and subsystems; development of associated industrial capabilities support techniques and processes; development of associated manufacturing techniques and processes; modeling and simulation; simulation-based acquisition; integrated data environments and product data managers; and development of operational systems.   This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2). It is intended that this BAA be open for a period of three years from the date of publication. Proposals may be submitted by any non-governmental entity including commercial firms, institutions of higher education with degree-granting programs in science and/or engineering (universities), or by consortia led by such concerns. NSWC Crane encourages participation by small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, and historically black colleges and universities and minority institutions. However, no part of this BAA is specifically reserved for these entities. The following guidelines apply to concept papers or proposals. Typically each proposal may be funded incrementally for periods up to five years subject to the availability of appropriations and funded between $10,000 to $10,000,000,!  with the size of each dependent upon the topic(s) (although NSWC Crane reserves the right to entertain larger proposals based on the availability of funds). More than one effort may be funded for an individual topic area, and deliverables should demonstrate the results of scientific study and experimentation. Proposals for non-innovative, marginal improvements are inappropriate under BAA authority and would not be considered for funding. In order to minimize the cost regarding proposal preparation, as a preliminary step, interested parties are strongly encouraged to submit an initial synopsis (commonly referred to as "white paper"). This white paper should not exceed 10 pages, with a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, and a rough cost estimate. Offerors should submit the white papers electronically. A title, BAA number, offeror name, project duration, approximate cost, and a brief abstract with information explicitly pertinent to the proposed work must accompany the white paper. The Government reserves the right to request a full technical and cost proposal from any, all, part of, or none of the offerors submitting white papers. Offerors submitting the most promising white papers will be encouraged to submit full technical and co! st proposals on all or part of their white paper submission. However, any such encouragement does not guarantee funding or assure a subsequent award. Offerors may submit full technical and cost proposals even if they did not submit a white paper or their white paper was not identified as promising. The Government will acknowledge the receipt of white papers and full technical and cost proposals by e-mail.   White papers (and proposals) will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria:  (1) Overall scientific, technical, and socio-economic merits of the proposed effort; (2) Potential relevance and contributions to the area of interest; (3) Degree to which new and creative solutions to technical issues important to the area of interest are proposed as well as the degree to which technical data and/or computer software developed under the proposed effort are to be delivered with unrestricted (Government Purpose) rights; (4) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; (5) The qualifications, capabilities and experience of the proposed Principal Investigator, team leader or other key personnel who are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; and (6) Realism and reasonableness of the proposed costs (subject to the availability of funds). These criteria are listed in descending order of importance, and the non-price factors, when take! n together, are significantly more important than price. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR FUNDING ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. Any responsible businesses may submit a proposal. White papers may be submitted at any time prior to expiration of the BAA.  Please send white papers and proposals via e-mail to LogR&D@navy.mil. Please refer to BAA number N00164-05-R-6660 in all correspondence and communications.

The efforts involve the design, de velopment, maintenance of radar/sensor systems, components, and dual purpose technologies and also the ability to coordinate, manage and report the progress to the satisfaction of the USASMDC Sensors Division's Technical Manager.  This effort is a continuation of activities performed under prior contracts entitled Advanced Radar Component Technology (DASG60-94-C-0035) and Radar Component Technology (DASG60-89-C-0093). The overall objective of the Advanced Radar Component Technology (ARCT) contract is to develop and demonstrate advanced subsystems, supporting hardware, concepts and software alogrithms for the Next Generation Radar within the Ballistic Missile Defense Sys tem and for other sensor types that operate in different frequency spectra (visible, infrared, etc.).  The effort will provide USASMDC with a series of integrated programs that will include planning, design, development, fabrication, demonstration, analysi s, testing and evaluation of various advanced radar/sensor technologies for future applications.  The technology initiatives shall be directed toward sensor sub-systems including transmitters, receivers, arrays, subarrays, processors, optics and software a lgorithms.

Power conditioner technology is also applica ble to other areas such as communications, processing, and other areas where size, weight, and volume are major considerations.  Dual use technologies will be considered for intra-service requirements, as well as for use by civilian industry.  Due to evolv ing BMDS requirements, many of the specific parameters associated with these technology efforts cannot be determined at the time of solicitation/contract award.  Task Orders with specific parameters will be provided throughout the contract period as defini tive needs are identified.   A significant portion of this contract will involve providing continued customer support to program offices such as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), PATRIOT, SHORAD/SENTINEL.

<SUBJECT>R -- Mobility Services for All Americans Initiative Stakeholder Advisory Group Facilitation
<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) intends to award a 45-month SOLE-SOURCE contract to the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) under which APTA will support the Mobility Services for All Americans Program (MSAA).  

One of the major objectives of MSAA is to help transportation-disadvantaged individuals (e.g., senior citizens, individuals with lower incomes, and persons with disabilities) by creating a bridge between transportation and the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and human services communities in order to develop new solutions that combine the efforts and knowledge of both.  

In support of MSAA, APTA will:  (a) attend a kick-off meeting at the U. S. Department of Transportations headquarters; (b) develop a project plan; (c) develop an MSAA Stakeholder Advisory Group Member List; (d) assemble MSAA Stakeholder Advisory and Special Working Groups; (e) support MSAA Foundation Research Advisory Group activities; and (f) develop/define a program measures of effectiveness matrix.   

This contemplated MSAA support contract requires a facilitating agency possessing ALL of the following qualifications/features: (a) established professional networks at all levels (e.g., international, national, state, local) and sizes that include both public and private sectors and across transportation and human service communities; (b) clear understanding of, and expertise in, Intelligent Transportation Systems and human service transportation issues; (c) experience in performing stakeholder facilitation functions, including planning, delivery and management of meetings, workshops, committees and task forces, etc.; (d) capability of providing objective (e.g., diversified, balanced, unbiased) technical advice to the program steering committee; and (e) located in the Washington, D. C. metropolitan area.  

It is believed that APTA is the only organization possessing ALL of those needed qualifications/features.  APTA is the leading nonprofit public transportation industry advocacy group with a broad and diversified representation of stakeholders from bus, rapid transit commuter rail systems, and organizations responsible for planning, designing, constructing, financing and operating transit systems.  APTA members include both public and private industries and transit service operators of all sizes.  Collectively, over ninety percent of the public transportation trips in the United States are delivered by APTA members.

Through its Access Committee, APTA has assisted the public transportation industry in promoting successful implementation of the transportation provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 and other related federal legislation or regulations.  This Committee is well organized and represented by experts from various disciplines who meet regularly to review, respond to, and share information on issues pertaining to public transportation accessibility.  The Access Committee can become a key asset to assist APTA in carrying out this contract.

APTA also has ready access to a wealth of ITS expertise and resources.  Many APTA members are developers, consultants, or users (e.g., transit operators) of ITS technologies and applications.  APTAs research and technology committee and the ITS Public Transportation forum, co-chaired with ITS America, are two key contributors in the development and execution of the USDOT ITS transit program.  APTA has been assisting the US Department of Transportation in facilitating ITS Transit National and International Best Practices Workshops that address various ITS transit-related issues.  Specifically, APTA hosted an international workshop in July of 2004 on the subject of linking technology with mobility and accessibility for the transportation disadvantaged.  Building upon the outcomes of this workshop, APTA has been playing an active role in bridging the gaps between the transportation and human services communities to provide quality services to the transportation-disadvantaged population.

Based on its nonprofit status, diversified representation which includes public and private industries and technical expertise in accessibility, ITS and human service transportation-related issues, APTA is believed to be the only agency that can effectively perform the contemplated MSAA support contract described herein.

HOWEVER, any interested organization believing that it can clearly and convincingly demonstrate its suitability for performing the contemplated MSAA support contract shall, not later than May 20, 2005, submit a Statement of Qualifications to:  Mr. James Mowery, Office of Acquisition Management (HAAM30-D), Federal Highway Administration, Room 4410, 400 Seventh Street, S.

<DESC>Scope of Work  P/N 09-C05121
Install New Underground Cables 
Revised 03/24/04
Loran Station Seneca, NY

Existing Conditions: The existing cables that connect the LORSTA to the receiving antenna were damaged and spliced as many as 10 years ago while performing site drainage ditch work.  The splices have intermittently caused problems, particularly during the last three winters.  In addition to these splices, new damage (perhaps by animals) is evident where the cable connects to the tower.  Only 6 channels (out of 38) are available for use by the Station. This is not sufficient for the LORSTA to continue operating.

We are proposing that the cables be replaced entirely.  We are asking the unit make temporary emergency repairs at their expense.  

Site Visit: Contractor must visit the site before submitting bids.  Make arrangements for a site visit at 607-869-5393.

Military Station Regulations: The Contractor, his employees, and sub contractors shall become familiar with and obey all Station regulations.  All personnel employed on the project shall keep within the limits of the work and avenues of ingress and egress, and shall not enter any other areas outside the site of work unless required to do so in the performance of their duties.  

Scope of Work:  Install New Underground Cables 

General: The cable to be replaced consists of two runs of approximately 2500 feet each.  The cable is designated as type RG-111, a direct-bury twinaxial cable.  Direct bury cable is preferred over type RG-22 cable installed in conduit based on to the nature of the installation and concern about long term moisture intrusion into buried conduit.  Remove existing cable as part of this work.

The cable shall buried approximately 2 feet below grade or as otherwise recommended by the cable manufacturer for this type of installation.  Maintain 2 feet of cover at all swale and drainage ditches.  The cable routing crosses approximately 40 feet of asphalt drive.  Cut and repair drive as necessary to install cable.  Coordinate cable transitions to building and tower with local operation.  

Note that copper ground radials (copper cables approx. ¼ inch in diameter) emanating approximately every 2 degrees from the base of the tower(s) are located in the vicinity of the new cable installation.  Locate and mark radial locations.  Install new cable above or below ground radials using additional insulation material as necessary to protect both the cable and ground radials.  Protect ground radials from damage during new cable installation.  Repair ground radials damaged by this work using cadwelding or silver solder as necessary to restore continuity.

Warranty: The Contractor shall provide a material and labor warranty for the work of this Contract for a period of one-year from the date of completion.

Cleanup of Work Areas and Site Restoration: The Contractor shall remove and properly dispose of all trash and debris incident to the contract work from the limits of government property, as well as all adjacent affected areas.  Any surfaces that may have been damaged by the Contract work shall be restored to pre-construction condition.

Acceptance of Work: Prior to acceptance of work by the Coast Guard, the Contractor shall arrange an inspection of the work site to ensure proper operation, to identify necessary corrective work, and to ensure proper work area cleanup.

Performance Period: All work shall be completed within the performance period indicated in the solicitation.

The associated NAICS Code is 541710.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries  Service Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program (MMHSRP) plans to conduct a health assessment research project in April 2005 on the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncates) population in and around St. Josephs Bay, Florida.  This research is part of the on-going investigation into the bottlenose dolphin Unusual Mortality Event (UME) that occurred between March and April 2004 along the Florida Panhandle.  The goal of the project is to assess the health of the bottlenose dolphin population along the Florida Panhandle, which has been impacted by two UMEs in the past five years (199-2000 and 2004), and investigate why it appears to be more susceptible to red-tide events in comparison to dolphin populations in other parts of the Gulf of Mexico.  As part of the on-going UME investigation, the research will help establish a baseline of dolphin health for animals in the affected area, and will allow comparison with samples from the 1999-2000 and 2004 UMEs.  Samples collected from live animals in April 2005 will be used to investigate:  1immune functions; 2contaminant loads; 3disease, and 4the genetic stock structure of the population.  The live captures will also initiate the process of identifying individual dolphins for longer term monitoring of the population.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information include in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number NFFK-5-147JMH is issued as a Request for Proposal.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-02.  There is no size standard related to this acquisition.  The associated NAICS Code is 541710.  The bottlenose dolphin population in and around St. Joseph's Bay along the Florida Panhandle has suffered two Unusual Mortality Events (UMEs)
in the past five years.  The second UME occurred most recently in April-May 2004, and involved at least 107 dead dolphins.  Title IV of the Marine Mammal Protection Act requires NOAA to investigate the marine mammal UMEs, and NOAA is planning a 2-week dolphin health assessment research project to evaluate the impacts of the 2004 UME on the Florida Panhandle dolphin population.  One component of the research requires specialized expertise in measuring thermal profiles during health assessment examinations, as well as conducting extensive follow up tracking of dolphins fitted with radio tags for several weeks after the health assessment is completed.  The tracking of tagged dolphins is needed to help identify the movement patterns of dolphins inside and outside St. Joseph's Bay where the UMEs have historically occurred.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this combined synopsis/solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation which will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors consider.

<DESC>This amendment serves as official notification of the following changes to the original posting dated March 25, 2005: 

1) In defining the area of consideration for prospective offerors wishing to meet our needs, we have determined that the need would be better expressed as a factor of "commute time" rather than in terms of raw mileage from campus to offeror facility.  This amendment changes the previous 25 mile maximum distance requirement in the original posting to  "not more than a 45-50 minute one-way commute from the NETC located at 16825 South Avenue, Emmitsburg, MD".   

2) The closing date for receipt of bids is hereby extended until 4:00 P.M. EST, Tuesday, April 12.
