<DESC>The National Council on Disability (NCD) is interested in evaluating the extent and type(s) of evidence-based federal and state health care reforms and changes for people with disabilities, in both the private and public sectors, which make health care more consumer driven and include some of the following features: a) adequate information to empower consumers to make informed decisions when choosing a health plan or provider; b) quality standards (e.g., health care report cards) that are developed in collaboration with people with disabilities and are responsive to the clinical and information needs of consumers with disabilities; c) adequate appeals and grievance processes to enable consumers to challenge health plans and health provider decisions, including arbitration mechanisms, ombudsmen independent of health plans, and private rights of action; and, d) consumer governance in which consumers and purchasers, not providers and payers, dominate the governing of the health care system through purchasing cooperatives and various oversight mechanisms.

To that end, NCD is interested in funding a study and conducting research to address the following main items related to the issue of consumer-oriented health care within the context of Medicare/Medicaid reform as it relates to Americans with disabilities. NCD is interested in looking at a range of practices or programs that may represent the extent of best-evidence to emerging-evidence of effectiveness in terms of results or outcomes for consumers. The estimated contract period of performance is 10 months.  

NCD will distribute its Consumer-Oriented Health Care Requests for Proposals (RFPs) to interested parties on December 16, 2002. NCD will expect interested parties to submit their responses by February 3, 2003. 

Copies of the RFP may be requested by mail or picked up at NCD on or after the issue date. All requests must reference the RFP number and title. For more information, contact Martin Gould, mgould@ncd.gov, 1331 F Street, NW, Suite 850, Washington, DC 20004; 202-272-2004 or 202-272-2074 TTY.

<DESC>The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) intends to award a sole source procurement contract to Southeast Agnet Radio Network.  The firm will design, produce, and implement a 3-State region publicity campaign to promote the upcoming 2002 Census of Agriculture. This will involve network radio station announcements during regularly scheduled farm and ranch news programs.  The announcements will air between November 2002 and March 2003.  The campaign will include a variety of informational news announcements, some including USDA officials, which will be aired throughout Alabama, Florida, and Georgia.  A minimum of 90, 60-second network features, 100, 30 second announcements, and 60 ?billboard" announcements will be aired within Alabama, Georgia, and Florida.  A total of 250 network announcements, or approximately 15,750 individual radio station announcements will be delivered. 

I.	Background  ? About the Census of Agriculture

	The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) is the primary collector of U.S. agricultural data and publishes official statistics as authorized by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  NASS serves the basic agricultural and rural data needs of the country with accurate, timely, and unbiased statistical information and services to the public.  The primary sources of data for NASS reports are information provided by farmers, ranchers, and agribusinesses.  NASS relies on the voluntary cooperation of respondents to report data except for the Census of Agriculture which is mandated by federal law.  Data reported by respondents are confidential and protected from disclosure by federal statute. 

NASS has 46 field offices (called State Statistical Offices (SSOs), each headed by a State Statistician), servicing all 50 states and Puerto Rico.  Data collection of the Census of Agriculture is conducted by mailout and mail back of report forms.  

NASS has two primary target audiences for Publicity efforts:

?	Data Providers - Much of our current publicity and promotion work is directed toward data providers.

?	Data Users - May include Government and academia, agricultural communicators (print, broadcast, and television), agricultural analyst, agricultural producer groups (e.g. the Farm Bureau, the Corngrowers Assocation, National Pork Producers Council, etc), and agribusiness who supply, buy from or support agricultural production.  
 


II.	Purpose

The purpose of the campaign is to increase awareness about the Census of Agriculture and how it may positively impact agricultural producers.  The goals of the 3-State region publicity campaign are:

1.  To convince farmers and ranchers to respond to the 2002 Census of Agriculture conducted by NASS/USDA.

2.  To raise the level of name recognition of the Census of Agriculture and create positive associations with the data it collects and disseminates. 


III.	Ownership and Confidentiality

NASS will retain the copyright of any published work, including original photography and illustration, if any. All information received by you in the course of working with the NASS is considered confidential and remains the property of the NASS.

Please e-mail your quotes to Djoyner@ars.usda.gov or you can fax them to (202) 720-3987 by November 6, 2002.

<DESC>Notice of intent for a sole source award.  This is not an RFP.  The Federal Highway Administration anticipates a sole source award to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to support the deployment of the Transportation Analysis and Simulation System (TRANSIMS) model at up to six pilot sites. TRANSIMS is a travel forecasting procedure designed to be used by Transportation Planning Organizations (TPOs), Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPOs) or other entities.   The core of TRANSIMS was developed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).  PwC was selected by LANL through a competitive cost sharing procurement process to develop a commercially viable, user-friendly version of TRANSIMS.  PwC has developed the only commercial version of TRANSIMS. There is no other firm that possesses the integral knowledge of TRANSIMS necessary for the deployment support at the pilot sites.  It is anticipated that an award will be made by 30 Sep 02.  Parties interested in additional details concerning this potential sole source award should contact Anthony Rowell, Federal Highway Administration, Office of Acquisition Management at 202-366-6870.

The work will consist of Sand Excavation, the procurement and installation of new playground equipment, and the installation of a Sports Field.  The successful contractor will be selected using performance/price tradeoff procedures resulting in the best value to the Government. Past performance is considered of greater value compared to price.  It is highly recommended that you register to be notified of any new postings for this solicitation and/or any other postings published by our office. However, remember that the notification of changes that result from registration is only a service and any failure of the service to notify you of changes cannot be used against the Government in any way, shape or form.

Description:

The General Services Administration intends on evaluating an up to ten-year lease through an existing, previously competed, renewal option for up to 120,886 rentable square feet of office and related space including two official parking spaces.  The rentable square feet must yield between 101,000 and 105,000 BOMA Usable Square Feet.  The requirement requests that the existing lessor provide a tenant allowance, and upgrade building common areas.  This lease action has received General Services Administration's Congressional Oversight Committee approval.

The General Services Administration will consider any sources that meet all of its requirements to determine whether relocation is in the best interest of the Government.  A cost-benefit analysis and consideration of other factors including Congressional authority, timing, costs of moving, alteration costs, impact on agency mission, availability of parking for employees, and other variables to be determined by the General Services Administration will be considered in the relocation decision.

The required space must be within 3,000 walkable linear feet from the Bethesda Metro-Rail Station within the following delineated area:

North:  Jones Bridge Road to Rockville Pike to Woodmont Avenue to Battery Avenue.

East:  Connecticut Avenue (Route 185)
South: Bradley Lane to Bradley Boulevard

West:  Arlington Road to Old Georgetown Road to Battery Avenue.

The space must be ready for occupancy by July 2003.  In addition, all offers should anticipate a $38 to 42 per BOMA Usable Square Foot tenant allowance above the General Services Administration warm-lit shell definition as part of their offered proposal and as part of the rental consideration.  Percentages for profit and overhead along with the imputed amortization rate should be provided.

<CONTACT>Contracting Officer John Sorgini, 781-377-7512, Contract Specialist Patricia Forest, 781-377-7512, Technical Contact Ron Martin, 781-377-7245
<DESC>This is a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Industry Day Announcement for the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Airborne Cluster IV Phase I (Pre-System Development and Demonstration (SDD)).  This supersedes previous synopsis R459 posted 18 October 2002.  All other posted documents are still valid. The Global Grid Product Area Directorate, Headquarters Electronic Systems Center (ESC/DIG) is hosting a Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Airborne (Cluster IV) Industry Day for government and industry members.  The Industry Day will be held on 28 October from 0730 - 1230, in the O'Neill Auditorium, Bldg 1612, 5 Eglin Street, Hanscom AFB, MA.  One-on-one sessions following the industry day will be conducted in one-hour blocks of time in Conference Room W26 located on the first floor of Building 1612 by appointment from 1330 - 1730 on the 28 October. PURPOSE:  The JTRS Airborne Industry day is to provide industry the Airborne JTRS program vision and strategy and to obtain industry feedback related to programmatic, risks, schedule, etc.  To accomplish this, briefings will be presented addressing the JTRS Airborne Program Plan, the Desired Warfighting Capabilities, the Airborne Network Concept, and supporting Lincoln Laboratory's activities.  While all are welcome to attend the morning presentations, the program will only entertain requests for one-on-one discussions with those contractors interested in submitting a Phase I proposal.  The one-on-one discussions will be 60 minutes in duration and the government would appreciate your comments or feedback on the following: - Program Strategy;  - Draft SOO;  - What are the key tasks to accomplish so that JTRS and Airborne Network are a success? - What tasks drive the overall schedule and can they be worked in Phase I? - How can we shorten our program schedule, and by how much? - How do we incorporate Lincoln Lab's analysis efforts into the JTRS strategy?  - What areas of research and/or analysis should we direct to the Air Force Research Laboratories that would reduce future JTRS Cluster 4 Airborne risk?  - What directly funded or internal research and development (IR&D) products, standards, and protocols are you aware of that would offer capabilities required by the JTRS Airborne C4ISR Network or for the Airborne JTRS design? - Other items your company deems relevant. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  The Air Force will acquire the JTRS Airborne radio sets in two phases.  Phase 1 is a full and open competition, focusing on (1) defining an airborne network architecture and attributes that can be used to derive platform integration requirements for JTRS; (2) an evolutionary acquisition model to provide airborne JTRS to fulfill near term legacy system replacement requirements, transitional requirements for a gateway capability, as well as requirements for full network-centric capabilities; and (3) a packaging concept for a family of cost-effective, flexible radio modules to accommodate platform constraints to the maximum extent practical. The Government is considering award of multiple requirements definition contracts in this phase. Phase 1A results (7 mos. after award) will be used to finalize the statement of objectives and performance requirements document for the Phase 2 solicitation. Phase 1B results (12 mos. after award) will feed directly into the front end of Phase 2, kick-starting the effort to allow a more efficient Phase 2 development schedule. Phase 2 would be the full and open competition for the system development, demonstration, and options for low rate initial production for JTRS Airborne Radio Systems. Networking attributes and platform constraints identified in Phase 1, as well as the initial concepts for a family of flexible, cost-effective radio modules to supply the airborne domain, will feed directly into the detailed design and demonstration efforts of Phase 2. The draft Phase I Statement of Objectives (SOO) and other related documentation are posted on the Hanscom Air Force Base HERRB web site.  Go to http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil/rfp_list.asp, and then click on 'Airborne Joint Tactical Radio System'.  We will welcome your questions, comments, clarifications, concerns, etc. at Industry Day either in the open session or in the one-on-one sessions.  Request that you provide your written comments to the government no later than 8 Nov 02.  Send your comments to the Following: Sources Sought:  The Government requests potential contractors submit a capability package, not to exceed ten (10), 8.5 x 11 inch once-sided pages (Format:  Microsoft Word 97, Font Times Roman, 10 pt, 1.25 inch margins) via e-mail to John.Sorgini@Hanscom.af.mil and Pat.Forest@Hanscom.af.mil not later than noon, 12 Nov 02.  The capability package should indicate the source's intent to participate in the JTRS Airborne (Cluster IV) Phase I Contract and should address understanding and/or experience in providing in information discussed in the Draft SOO.  Sources are also requested to identify any on-going Government contract vehicles they may have for the same or similar work (limit 1 page).  Please include the name and number of the on-going contracts, contract scope, contract type, period of performance, contract deliverables, dollar thresholds and limitations, the issuing Government agency, and the name and telephone number of the Contracting Officer.  The Government intends to evaluate each prime contractor capability package submitted to determine whether they are considered "highly competitive" or "not highly competitive" and will notify each source, by e-mail, no later than 30 November.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a request for bid or proposals, nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for the information provided in response to this synopsis.  The HERBB will be the primary source of information for the Airborne Joint Tactical Radio System acquisition.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-03-00017, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-09.  The  associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541710, which has a size standard of 500 employees to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  The contract will be awarded as a result of full and open competition.  A firm, fixed-price purchase order is anticipated to  result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for environmental mercury sampling and analysis of 180 samples.  Environmental sampling is required to fully characterize total and methyl mercury in  each environmental media, including the biotic compartments of fishes, plankton  and algae. A watershed approach is to be taken, whereby soils, shallow groundwater and surface waters are sampled and the data used to parameterize a model of mercury loading. Provided that source characterizations reveal loading between watersheds to be uniform, additional modeling and analyses  will be performed to evaluate ecological parameters influencing variable methyl mercury body burden in predatory fishes (bass and catfish) among ponds: size of pond and differing primary and/or secondary productivities; fraction riparian habitat responsible for increased methylation rates, or  differences in food webs between ponds. Total mercury sampling using clean chemistry methods for the environmental media will be performed initially by contractor, and it is hoped that ultimately tribal and EPA personnel can undertake future sampling. Sampling will be performed for one sampling  event in October/November, 2002 and 5 sampling events in January, April, June, August and October of 2003.  The contractor shall collect surface water, shallow groundwater and atmospheric depositional samples utilizing clean  chemistry techniques and analyze samples for total and methyl mercury.   The objective of this contract is to conduct the needed environmental sampling to support model development and MeHg hazard assessment in the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation (S. Dakota), as well as the needed laboratory analysis to quantify mercury concentrations in the samples.  Task 1:  Environmental Sampling of Mercury.  The contractor shall perform characterizations of mercury inputs through environmental sampling of atmospheric deposition, surface water, sediments and shallow groundwater on the number of samples listed in Table 1. For both the collection and analysis of  environmental samples, the contractor shall adhere to the sampling and analytical methods explained in the document Guidance for Implementation and Use of EPA Method 1631 for the Determination of Low Level Mercury (40 CFR part 136, EPA 821-R-01-023, March 2001). The document is available on the  USEPA web site: http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/methods/1631.html. This includes requirements for clean techniques, quality control, preservation, and storage of samples (chain-of-custody).  Task 2:  Laboratory Analyses for Mercury.  The contractor shall analyze environmental samples collected  above and provide data as to concentrations of total mercury and methyl mercury in each media, following the Guidance for Implementation and Use of EPA Method 1631 for the Determination of Low Level Mercury (40 CFR part 136, EPA 821-R-01-023, March 2001).  Methyl mercury in sediments (as well as  drier sediments and soils) should be prepared by acid bromide/methyl chloride extraction and analyzed by aqueous phase ethylation, isothermal GC separation, and cold vapor atomic fluorescence (CVAFS) detection using modified EPA draft method 1630. Total mercury in sediments is prepared by cold aqua  regia digestion and analyzed by SnCl2 reduction, dual gold amalgamation, and CVAFS detection using modified EPA method 1631.  Modified EPA method 1631 used for water analysis includes total mercury determined by BrCl oxidation, SnCL2 reduction, and dual gold amalgamation. All mercury analysis for  water samples should be performed using CVAFS (Bloom, Crecelius, and Fitzgerald, 1988). Monomethyl mercury (MMHg) is liberated from water through distillation using an all teflon  distillation system (Horvat, Bloom, and Liang, 1993).   Distilled samples are analyzed using aqueous phase ethylation  purging onto Carbotrap, isothermal GC separation, and CVAFS (Bloom, 1989). To address accuracy and precision, all laboratory analyses should follow quality assurance measures with the following minimum frequency: the collection of laboratory duplicates (one per ten samples), method blanks (three  per analytical batch), filtration blank (one per ten samples), and laboratory-spike recovery (one per ten samples) or standard reference material (one per ten samples).  All handling of samples in the laboratory are undertaken in a mercury-free clean air bench.  Ultra-clean mercury trace metal  protocol are used including the use of rigorously cleaned and tested teflon equipment and sample bottles and pre-screened and laboratory purified reagents. A class-100 clean air station is used and monitored routinely for low levels of total gaseous mercury. Laboratory atmosphere and water supply  are also routinely monitored for low levels of mercury. Primary standards used in the laboratory are NIST certified or traceable to NIST certified materials. MeHg standards made from pure powder  and calibrated for MeHg against NBS-3133 and cross verified by daily analysis of NRCC DORM-2 (see  http://geopubs.wr.usgs.gov/open-file/of00-043/Hg/mercury.html #HginCores).  As the experimental ponds are to be manipulated by fish stocking in early August, the contractor is projected to start on or around Nov. 1, 2002 to characterize the environmental conditions at the beginning of the study.  Spring and Fall sampling events will be planned in ?03 to characterize environmental conditions as the study is underway. The contractor shall be communicate with the Project Officer to discuss technical matters. The contractor shall formally document progress on a monthly basis. If any significant  problems occur, the contractor shall notify the EPA Project Officer immediately.  The monthly progress report shall be submitted to EPA by the 10th of each month following the month the work was accomplished.  Monthly progress report shall include:  1) Work performed and accomplished during the  reporting period, including cost breakdown; 2)   Problems encountered and recommendations for remedial action; 3) Work to be performed during the next reporting period.  Progress payments shall be made monthly.  Deliverables: 1)  CD-ROM with all records of samples taken, field notes, and  corresponding laboratory analytical results for samples processed by contractor; and 2) Summary letter describing project and any supporting information relevant to interpretation of both environmental samples and laboratory analyses.  The period of performance is from date of contract award  through December 30, 2003.  The contractor shall provide a price per sample for each of the contract line items below.  Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) One:  36 each Surface water - methyl; CLIN Two:  36 each Surface water - total; CLIN Three: 9 each Sediment - methyl; CLIN Four: 9 each Sediment -  total; CLIN Five: 9 each Ground water - methyl; CLIN Six:  9 each Ground water - total; CLIN Seven: 36 each Atmospheric - methyl; CLIN Eight: 36 each Atmospheric - total.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for written information from all parties, especially small and small disadvantaged firms, interested in the upcoming acquisition for operation and maintenance services for the Alaska Radar System.  The information is requested for market research and is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Responses should focus on your firm's technical and financial capability to provide technical and management services for the operation and maintenance of the radar sites in the Alaska Radar System, as described below.  You should address the contracting officer's interest items on (i) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), (ii) Statement of Objectves (SOO) v. Statement of Work (SOW), and (iii) commercial practices; standard publicity brochures are not particularly desired.  Responses to this synopsis will be used for market research to determine under what, if any, set aside procedures this acquisition will be conducted.  The contractor shall be responsible for all operation and maintenance of the manned and unmanned AN/FPS-117 long-range radars and the AN/FPS/124 unattended short range radars, as well as the site facilities (real property, real property installed equipment, and utility systems) at approximately 18 remote Alaska locations on Alaska's northern and western coasts and mountain interior (access by air, seasonal access by barge).  The contractor will also be responsible for the Maintenance Control and Communications Center and for certain equipment in the Regional Air Operations Center at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska.  Radar operations and maintenance, and other communications-electronics systems, is the core of the requirement, but facilities support is also critical to mission success.  The contractor is responsible for maintenance and snow removal for seven gravel airstrips, many miles of gravel roads, tram systems at several sites, utilities, water and sewage systems, power generation, and environmental protection.  Transportation, logistics, food service and housekeeping, and weather operations are also important elements of operation.  The Government will probably issue the solicitation in the summer of 2003, with award in the January-March 2004 time frame and with performance to begin on 1 October 2004.  The current and previous contracts were solicited on an unrestricted basis, but the Government solicits capability statements and expressions of interest and intent from small businesses.  Given the great complexity of the mission and the broad expertise required in addition to particular expertise on radars, please include information as to the size of your business and any planned teaming arrangement.  Small businesses (including veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned,  HUBZone, disadvantaged, and women-owned, and other small businesses) are particularly invited to respond to express interest in submitting a proposal and to provide information as to their qualifications.  The current contract was acquired with SIC 8744, Facilities Support Management Services.  The corresponding NAICS is 561210, Facilities Support Services.  The corresponding size standard is $23M.  The contracting officer invites input as to whether 513390 for radar station operations is not a more appropriate NAICS.  The current contract's Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached for industry comments.  The contracting officer invites comment from industry as to whether using a SOO SOO would encourage or discourage firms, especially small businesses, from submitting an offer.  Under the SOO approach, the Government would issue a SOO as part of it solicitation. The SOO would broadly describe the top-level requirements allowing industry maximum flexibility to propose innovative and cost effective methods to meet those objectives.  The previous acquisition for this requirement was not accomplished under FAR Part 12 because of the complexity and type of contract terms and conditions.  However, responses to this synopsis will be used to assist the contracting officer to determine whether the upcoming acquisition can be accomplished under Part 12.  Interested firms should submit information on their experience, capabilities, and resources to satisfactorily perform the mission as stated in the PWS.  Capability statements of up to 15 pages in length may be submitted to the contracting officer, Timothy Inman, 3CONS/LGCZ, 10480 22nd Street, Elmendorf AFB, AK  99506, and are requested by 8 October 2002.

<DESC>This announcement modifies previous synopsis/solicitation N68936-02-T-0242 which was issued 21 August 2002.  The following changes have been made: This is an FULL and OPEN COMPETITION, unrestricted, not a small business set aside.  The Quantity for CLIN 0004 was omitted and is as follows: The minimum quantity is 10 each; the maximum quantity is 720 each.  Order limitation is as follows: The maximum number of disks ordered in a given 48 hour period would be 50 each of a CLIN or combined CLINS.  Regarding possible obsolete or discontinued items, a larger disk storage size may be quoted, but the SCSI interface and connector configuration is required as specified for each CLIN.  The 7200-RPM is a minimum and the Government will accept a 10000-RPM or 15000-RPM drive if the 7200-RPM is not available.  The correct response date is 22 Sept 2002.  Clarifications are provided for the following questions:  Question: do we want a particular brand name? Answer: NO.  Any hard drive meeting the requirements is acceptable.  The best value evaluation does include evaluation of reliability and quality.  Question: what are the hard drives for? Answer: The hard drives will be run on RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processors SGI (Silicon Graphics Inc), HP (Hewlett Packard) and Sun using respective UNIX OS (operating system).  Question: are the dimensions provided for the hard drives accurate? Answer: Yes.  The 4" size specified is the external physical dimension.  The disk platter size may be smaller (e.g. 3.5"). Question: is it correct that there are different quantities for each CLIN? Answer: this is correct.  There are different maximum quantities for each CLIN.  The minimum of 10 each is the same for all.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation that shall be considered by the agency.  These responses shall be submitted in writing to Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Code 210000D, Building 20259, Attention Peggy Richter, China Lake, CA 93555-6100 or by email to: richterpa@navair.navy.mil.

Request for Information (RFI) of Networking Services

I. INTRODUCTION:   The Department of Commerce (DOC)'s Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) program will commence operational support for a new joint program for the exchange of weather satellite data with the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) in October of 2004.  This RFI in intended to solicit industry input for networking services to operate a Local Area Network (LAN) for DOC in Suitland (Maryland) in October of 2003. The services shall also include a Wide Area Networking extension to interface with a telecommunication service provider to manage data flows from both EUMETSAT (in Darmstadt, Germany) and from NOAA (in Suitland (Maryland), Wallops Island (Virginia), and Fairbanks (Alaska)). 

II. SCOPE:   DOC is seeking information that will allow DOC to acquire and operate a Network Operating Center designated as "IJPS NOC" in Figure 1.  The "IJPS NOC" will interface to four separate DOC entities indicated by SOCC, CEMSCS, Fairbanks CDA, and Wallops CDA in Figure 1.   The dashed lines in Figure 1 will only be used for SOCC backup operation - where traffic will be re-routed from IJPS Networking Infrastructure to respective CDAs. The NOC will also interface to distinct telecommunication carriers contracted by EUMETSAT and NOAA to exchange the data between the two organizations. The NOC contractor will be responsible for both the installation of NOC LAN infrastructure, operations and maintenance of the NOC infrastructure, and the interface to the telecommunications carriers.  

The NOC will be used to distribute the weather satellite data indicated in Table 1.  Table 1 provides a listing that characterizes the different data streams of weather data that will be exchanged between SOCC, CEMSCS, CDAs and telecommunication carriers via the NOCC . All communications exchanges listed shall involve duplex communications. All interfaces shall be considered a local interface at the respective facilities in this document.

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information: 

"	Ideas and suggestions that proposes an implementation plans for NOC operations.
"	Approximate cost information (Rough Order of Magnitude Estimates) for services and infrastructure.
"	Services delivery schedule and infrastructure deployment schedule.


III. REQUIREMENTS:   This section enumerates the high-level functional requirements for IJPS NOC. 

"	The NOC contractor shall be able to provide state-of-the art NOC infrastructure including systems hardware, software, furnishings, and accessories to sustain NOC operations, maintenance of equipment, and support staff.  All infrastructures shall use industry standard network components and protocols.  

"	The IJPS NOC shall evolve to maintain a technology to the maximum extent practical. The NOC contractor shall ensure that the NOC is designed to provide an environment that meets or exceeds industry standards and all state, local, and federal regulations and standards as well as environmental control standards. 

"	IJPS NOC shall support mission critical functions and provide the highest levels of reliability and availability for all infrastructures provided. The contractor shall be able to develop contingency/disaster recovery plans and procedures addressing operations in the event of shutdown or lapse in service for any reason. The contractor shall assume an alternate DOC facility will be provided for backup. NOAA will be responsible for communications services transactions and fees required for contingency/service recovery plans.  It is essential that the respondent include a clear definition of availability including a description of the tools that will be used to measure it.  IJPS NOC shall be operated on a 24X7 basis for 365 days a year. 

"	All IJPS NOC interfaces to SOCC, CEMSCS, and NOAA and EUMETSAT service providers shall operate on a TCP/IP protocol suite and a 100 BT interface as indicated in table 1. The applications used for data streams exchanges between the  IJPS NOC and the respective organization  will use a TCP/IP socket connection. The IJPS NOC shall not introduce delays to degrade the performance of the local interface for TCP/IP operations.

"	The contractor shall be able to support physical security requirement including on-site security monitoring, access controls, and satisfy personnel and physical requirements of DOC. 

"	The contractor shall be able to support DOC computer network security requirements for a firewall to provide isolation of the NOC LAN from both the SOCC as well as the NOAA and EUMETSAT service provider networks.  

"	For every session between the SOCC, CEMSCS, and EUMETSAT, the NOC LAN infrastructure shall support Network Address Translation (NAT). DOC expects LAN NOC infrastructure to support the translation transparently. 

"	The contractor shall provide ROM estimates for the non-recurring and annual recurring using for the IJPS network. Assume a 3 year guaranteed contract. 

"	The contractor shall provide a deployment schedules with the technical details on the infrastructure that will be implemented. 

"	A contact phone number and e-mail address shall be included with the response as a point of contact for the DOC evaluation team to discuss

INTRODUCTION:   The Department of Commerce (DOC)'s Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) program will commence operational support for a new joint program for the exchange of weather satellite data with the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) in October of 2004.  This RFI in intended to solicit industry input for telecommunication services that will help secure turnkey communication services to support the program in October of 2003.  The telecommunication services will be required to connect satellite ground systems control centers located in Suitland (Maryland - USA) and Darmstadt (Federal Republic of Germany)

II. SCOPE:   DOC is seeking information that will assist in the development and deployment of a telecommunications networking services designated as "IJPS Network" in Figure 1.  The telecommunications services shall encompass all necessary Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) and transcontinental services that will be required to provision the services at the DOC facility in Suitland and at a EUMETSAT provided facility in Darmstadt (Germany).  DOC also expects the telecommunications carrier to support hardware installation, software installation, and support for management features of all equipment and devices proposed.

The IJPS network will be used to transport the weather satellite data indicated in Table 1.  Table 1 provides a listing that characterizes the different data streams of weather data that will be exchanged between Suitland and Darmstadt. All communications exchanges listed shall involve duplex communications.

The Interface Type field in Table 1 defines the interface between the telecommunication carrier's own-provided customer premise equipment and the respective Network Operation Center (NOC) in the respective organizations (DOC and EUMETSAT). This interface shall be considered a local interface at the respective facilities for the sake of the document. 

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information: 

"	Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, and acquiring the IJPS network. 
"	Technical feasibility of the alternative approaches proposed. 
"	Approximate cost information for alternatives (Rough Order of Magnitude Estimates). 
"	Provisioning Schedules. 


III. REQUIREMENTS:   This section enumerates the high-level functional requirements for IJPS network. 

"	IJPS Network shall provide commercial-grade data communications capabilities within the network using industry standard network components and protocols.  The potential of adding bandwidth-on-demand services for some data streams is highly desirable and respondents are encouraged to share any existing and future capabilities they have. 

"	IJPS Network shall evolve to maintain a technology and communications service edge with state of the art commercial services to the maximum extent practical. The operator's network shall offer DOC the flexibility to utilize new services. 

"	IJPS Network shall be a turnkey fully integrated system communications network solution proposed by the respondents. DOC will provide access to its own DOC facilities (in Suitland) and EUMETSAT facilities (in Darmstadt). DOC does not intend to negotiate with local access carriers or communications equipment vendors. For the purposes of this RFI, assume a single invoice with supporting details will be acceptable to DOC. 

"	IJPS Network shall support mission critical functions and provide the highest levels of reliability and availability including network transport and access diversity, and rapid response time for DOC outages.  In formulating responses, each respondent shall describe the reliability and availability characteristics of each alternative included in their response.  It is essential that the respondent include a clear definition of availability including a description of the tools that will be used to measure it.  IJPS network shall be operated on a 24X7 basis for 365 days a year by the respondent. 

"	The local interfaces to the IJPS network are based on a TCP/IP protocol suite and a 100 BT interface as indicated in table 1. The applications used for data streams exchanges between the local interface and the IJPS network will use a TCP/IP socket connection. The IJPS network shall not introduce delays to degrade the performance of the local interface for TCP/IP operations as the data is transported between Darmstadt and Suitland.

The IJPS network shall have the buffer capability to handle TCP re-transmissions in case of a communications outage. 

"	While the data streams are presented as separate data flows entries in Table 1, DOC does not have a preference if all streams are treated as separate communications channels on the IJPS Network between Suitland and Darmstadt, or considered as an aggregate bandwidth with each of different streams channelized into a virtual channel. In the latter case,  the DOC contractor's network shall provide a prioritization capability for a DOC specified virtual channel. The IJPS network shall provide the ability to collect and measures for performance data on per virtual channel basis as well as an aggregate one channel basis. 

"	 The IJPS Network shall be built on a completely dedicated network and shall not use the public Internet. Private IP networking services are not discouraged provided that the respondent presents guarantees and service manageability options that can be collected in compliance of meeting the defined performed criteria or Service Level Agreement (SLA). 

DOC encourages respondent to present alternative concepts and to describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved as matched against the functional requirements. The response shall include a diagram with proposed network configuration and CPE at each location (Suitland and Darmsatdt).

The DOC contractor shall provide all performance specifications to the delivery of the communication services including network and system availability, time to restore services, and performance evaluation criteria. DOC  expects the contractor to also discuss their performance evaluation criteria. 

"	Encryption shall not be required for transport of DOC data; however, DOC requires a level of trust on the carrier network that is not going to compromise any data transfer over the IJPS Network. 

"	The respondent shall provide ROM estimates for the non-recurring and annual recurring using for the IJPS network. Assume a 3 year guaranteed contract. 

"	The respondent shall provide estimated provisioning schedules with the time it takes for a service to be provisioned. The provisioning time shall include local -access provisioning during which the local loop is connected to the customer site, and service provisioning, during which the service is configured and turned on the respondent's carrier network. In the response, a respondent shall include any additional costs for expedited provisioning. 

"	A contact phone number and e-mail address shall be included with the response as a point of contact for the DOC evaluation team to discuss

The current and previous contracts were solicited on an unrestricted basis, but the Government solicits capability statements and expressions of interest and intent from small businesses.  Given the great complexity of the mission and the broad expertise required in addition to particular expertise on radars, please include information as to the size of your business and any planned teaming arrangement.  Small businesses (including veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned,  HUBZone, disadvantaged, and women-owned, and other small businesses) are particularly invited to respond to express interest in submitting a proposal and to provide information as to their qualifications.  The current contract was acquired with SIC 8744, Facilities Support Management Services.  The corresponding NAICS is 561210, Facilities Support Services.  The corresponding size standard is $23M.  The contracting officer invites input as to whether 513390 for radar station operations is not a more appropriate NAICS.  The current contract's Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached for industry comments.  The contracting officer invites comment from industry as to whether using a SOO SOO would encourage or discourage firms, especially small businesses, from submitting an offer.  Under the SOO approach, the Government would issue a SOO as part of it solicitation. The SOO would broadly describe the top-level requirements allowing industry maximum flexibility to propose innovative and cost effective methods to meet those objectives.  The previous acquisition for this requirement was not accomplished under FAR Part 12 because of the complexity and type of contract terms and conditions.  However, responses to this synopsis will be used to assist the contracting officer to determine whether the upcoming acquisition can be accomplished under Part 12.  Interested firms should submit information on their experience, capabilities, and resources to satisfactorily perform the mission as stated in the PWS.  Capability statements of up to 15 pages in length may be submitted to the contracting officer, Timothy Inman, 3CONS/LGCZ, 10480 22nd Street, Elmendorf AFB, AK  99506, and are requested by 8 October 2002.

<CONTACT>William McGannon 812-854-3617
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is seeking expressions of interest to understand state-of-the-art sensor technologies currently available for use on submarine offboard sensor platforms to be used on small to medium sized Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) sensors that would operate above the water line. 	Increasing the submarines Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Targeting  (ISRT) capability to achieve the Submarine Forces Strategic vision will require the development of small and autonomous ISR sensors for incorporation on unmanned offboard data collection vehicles such as UAVs and UUVs.   Information is requested on small, mission focused, autonomous, and relatively inexpensive EO (Electro-Optical), IR (Infra-Red), R (Radar), LD (Laser Designator), LRF (Laser Range Finder), EI (Electronic Intelligence), CR (Comm Relay),  LST (Laser Spot Tracker), MS (Multi-Spectral), HS (Hyper-Spectral), SI (Signal Intelligence), IRST (Infra-Red search and Track), CS (Chemical Sensor), BS (Biological Sensor), LADAR (Laser Radar), and LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). These sensors will be evaluated for potential use in future submarine Unmanned Vehicles.    	The following is a list of salient characteristics that should be met or exceeded: (a) The sensors should not weigh more than 10 pounds and be capable of being powered by unregulated vehicle power or an internal battery source.  Lighter weight sensors approaching 1 pound are desirable.  (b) The sensor should survive operational environmental factors such as temperature extremes, humidity, small craft shock and vibration.  (c)The sensor should be able to operate at an elevation of 8000 ft, have a minimum endurance of 7 hours and be able to function at a  speed of 130 kts..  	Part of this evaluation will be to define each sensors characteristics including data collection requirements and concepts, data analysis methodologies and physical characteristics that would limit it to a small to medium sized UAV or UUV sensor that would operate above the water line. These methodologies will include: mechanical packaging and electrical requirements; data interfaces; auxiliary data collection requirements; real-time processing, recording, and display requirements; near real-time and post-collection analysis and product generation requirements, and operator and maintenance requirements.  Respondents are asked to provide the above data along with some characteristics of the sensor, such as size, weight, volume, and power requirements. After the completion of this review, each sensor will be evaluated for its applicability for small to med ium sized UAV and UUV employment. Respondents are requested to provide a description of the payload and its capabilities and include any product data sheets.  Also the maturity of the payload (i.e. developmental or production) with any supporting performance and test data to support maturity claims.  	Company should distinctly identify which of the following category(s) the sensor falls into: EO (Electro-Optical), IR (Infra-Red), R (Radar), LD (Laser Designator), LRF (Laser Range Finder), EI (Electronic Intelligence), CR (Comm Relay), LST (Laser Spot Tracker), MS (Multi-Spectral), HS (Hyper-Spectral), SI (Signal Intelligence), IRST (Infra-Red search and Track), CS (Chemical Sensor), BS (Biological Sensor), LADAR (Laser Radar), LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). 	Responses are required to include the firm name, mailing address, telephone and facsimile numbers, World Wide We b (Internet) presence (if any), size of firm, number of years performing related work and direct points of contact including e-mail addresses.  Only written responses transmitted electronically, or by mail will be accepted.  Electronically submitted responses on CD are preferred. 	Responses to this announcement should be received NO LATER THAN 31 JANUARY 2003.  Respondents can send CDs and other data to: NSWC Crane, Code 607 Bldg. 2930, 300 Hwy. 361, Crane, IN 47522, ATTN: William McGannon.  This Request for Information announcement is for informational and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a solicitation and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  All information will be considered.  This is not an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quotations (RFQ) or a Request for Pro posals (RFP). 	The Government will not provide payment for any information provided in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government return any data provided.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.  NO TELEPHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED REQUESTING A BID PACKAGE OR SOLICITATION.  THERE IS NO BID PACKAGE OR SOLICITATION!  IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE PROCUREMENT INTEGRITY OF ANY FUTURE PROCUREMENT, IF ANY, THAT MAY ARISE FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, INFORMATION REGARDING THE TECHNICAL POINT OF CONTACT WILL NOT BE GIVEN AND NO APPOINTMENTS FOR PRESENTATIONS WILL BE MADE. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT to identify sources that can fulfill the requirement for measurement, estimation and prediction of marine corrosion of cylindrical metallic containers in support of Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC) missions.  Technologies are sought which can determine in-situ rates of corrosion and provide predictions of first corrosive penetration for seawater intrusion and leaching of contents for cylindrical metallic containers resting on the seabed and/or buried in the ocean sediment to a nominal depth of one meter.  The container housing material may be composed of various metals. The measurements would most likely be performed using certified divers and/or possibly remotely operated vehicles. Measurements of the corrosion might be performed using a probe (or equivalent) that scans the container without physically touching the container shell or marine growth.  The measurement provides an estimate of the present corrosion rate of the container and/or possibly the current thickness of the container walls.  Containers may range in size from many centimeters to several meters in length.  Containers may be resting on various seafloor materials, to being partially buried or may have significant marine growth present. Ocean water depths where the measurements would be performed may be in range of 5-100 meters.  Additional measurements of corrosion of the containers (or portions of containers) in laboratory conditions may be required.  Numerical models and/or algorithms for estimation and prediction of the corrosion rate for the same underwater containers are also sought.  Interested sources must submit their related information in writing to NAVAL FACILITIES ENGINEERING COMMAND CONTRACTS OFFICE, CODE NF23 BLDG. 41, NAVFACENGCOMDET-NFI, 3502 GOODSPEED STREET, SUITE 2, PORT HUENEME, CA 93043-4337.  DEADLINE for receiving responses is November 12, 2002.  Responses received after the deadline or without the required information shall be considered unacceptable and will not be considered.  Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation letters will be issued to the participants.

<DESC>The NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division  (NOTSD) requires development, fabrication, testing and logistics support for the Virginia Class Submarine (VSSN) Emergency Diesel Generator Control Panel (DGCP) Front Panel Simulator (FPS).   The successfully tested and completed trainer shall be delivered to NAVSUBSCOL, New London, CT.  The primary use of this trainer will be to teach operation, casualty and degraded modes, maintenance, engine troubleshooting and fault isolation skills.  The diesel engine generator set simulation software will be used to simulate a diesel operational engine (Caterpillar 3512B).  The student station will receive simulated inputs as if a real engine were connected.  The student station configuration will include the diesel generator control panel, the diesel local control panel, the laptop computer system and a two-dimensional photo engraved engine generator mockup.  The DLCP will have the physical appearance of the tactical DLCP and will simulate or stimulate the operations of the tactical DLCP.  Attached to the top of the DLCP will be the engine vision interface module.  This module will link data to the DGCP.  Other modules linking to the DLCP are the electronic control modules, the versatile control module and the integrated temperature sensor module.  The DLCP will provide necessary data to the laptop computer system.  This data will enable correct diagnostic processing with the CAT Electronic Technician (ET) Tool.  The interface between the Caterpillar ET Tool and the DLCP is proprietary and the government does not own the documentation to support it.  There will be no government furnished equipment or government furnished information in the production of this system.  Interested companies should respond with the following information:  1) Past performance on government contracts of like or similar nature;  2) Whether your company intends to bid as a prime or subcontractor; 3) Size and status (based on the related small business size standard of 750 employees).  4)  Describe ability to develop the logistics elements required to support this trainer. These elements include configuration management, provisioning, and operation and maintenance documentation.

<SUBJECT>--Industry Day III Forum Follow-Up
<DESC>NA GENERAL:  The Army Targets Management Office, hosted the THIRD Industry Day Forum on Tuesday and Wednesday, October 8 and 9, 2002, at Huntsville, AL.  The purpose of the forum was to provide interested parties and potential offerors information and an opportunity to  provide feedback on the proposed NGATS performance requirements.  Specifically, this third forum focused on a round table discussions of the Army's Performance Requirements Guideline Document (PRGD), and an initial briefing on the draft NGATS design. The PRGD is available for review at http://ngats.redstone.army.mil. All firms who produce target hardware, battlefield effects simulator, target control systems, target scoring systems, live fire ranges, or have experience in integration test and installation of similar distributed component systems are encouraged to provide questions or comments to the PRGD.  Persons or firms that attended the forum are encouraged to provide questions or comments to the briefings that were presented.  See below for submission instructions.  These additional questions and comments will be addressed on the CDROM provided to participants as a summary of the forum.  Interested firms may request a copy of this summary CD along with the questions or comments they submit.   CONTACT:  Questions, comments, and requests for the summary CD should be provided by 1 NOV 2002 to: 	Ms. Tanya Davis, 	Acquisition Center, 	AMSAM-AC-SM-H 	Fax: (256) 876-5234 or  	E-mail address: tanya.davis@redstone.army.mil BACKGROUND:  The Army Targets Management Office is developing a New Generation Army Target System to replace existing target systems on live fire ranges.  This NGATS target system will be made up of families of targetry components that are interchangeable and provide t he required performance at a low life cycle cost.  Compatible NGATS components will be deployed on Army training ranges in a sequential or blocked program where each block represents increases in performance, reductions in life cycle cost, or both. The NGA TS program is scheduled to begin fielding ranges in late FY06 with a Block I NGATS system.  The schedule for fielding Block II and subsequent blocks will be set at a later date.  In order to implement Block I, the government has begun requirement definitio n and system design activities with a design integration contractor, CSC Inc of Huntsville, AL.  As a part of this design activity, the Government, along with the design integration contractor, will develop and provide system requirements and interfaces th at target system components must meet.  The PRGD is the compilation of performance requirements that will serve as the source of information for specification development.  The INITIAL RELEASE of the NGATS Interface Control Documents is currently planned f or early in the second quarter of FY03.  During FY03, and FY04 the Government intends to sponsor a series of Industry Days including the design integration contractor and interested target industry companies to present the progress of the design and interf ace definitions.  Technical input from industry is strongly desired at these meetings.  Industry comment on the progress and direction of the government's activities will impact the content of the interfaces that NGATS Block I targetry components must meet .  The government's intent is to have a family of each type of system component that will meet the interface requirements and provide a spectrum of price/performance to satisfy the large spectrum of Army range types and requirements.  Beginning in FY03 and  continuing through FY04, the Government plans to operate a facility at the Redstone Arsenal where targetry component manufacturers can have their products tested for conformance to the requirements/interfaces. In late FY04, the government will contract on  a competitive basis, with a Production Integration Contractor to integrate and test a targetry system consisting of components that have been shown to meet th e requirements/interfaces.  Following the successful tests/demonstrations of the prototype targetry system, the Production Integration Contractor will install targetry systems on Army live fire ranges.  Options for post warranty support of the installed ra nges will be included in this contract for the use of range operators.  Installation of NGATS Block I ranges is expected to continue for several years.  NGATS Block II and any subsequent releases will be produced as a result of future procurement actions t o introduce technology advancement and satisfy new training requirements.  Such releases will be integrated and tested by a competitively selected production integration contractor who upon successful test/demonstration will be directed to install targetry  systems on Army live fire ranges.  The Production Integration contract will include a Hardware, Software and Services Exclusionary provision that will impose a restraint upon future business.  This is necessary to preclude potential conflicts of interest and prevent the existence of a conflicting interest that might bias the Production Integration Contractor's judgment.  Please see subpart 9.5, Federal Acquisition Regulation, ?Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest?. CONTACT:  Questions, comments, and requests for the summary CD should be provided by 1 NOV 2002 to: 	Ms. Tanya Davis, 	Acquisition Center, 	AMSAM-AC-SM-H 	Fax: (256) 876-5234 or  	E-mail address: tanya.davis@redstone.army.mil

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/request for quotation (RFQ) for the solicitation of commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  A written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is IBM03Q0006. Provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2001-09 are incorporated and made part of this RFQ.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 811212, Computer and Office Machine Repair and Maintenance; the small business size standard is $21.0 million.  

The acquisition is for a firm fixed price requirements contract for the purchase of the following commercial items: Item No. 0001. Supplies/Services-Service Call.  Provide on-site maintenance and repairs on a per call routine basis, to include parts and labor, in accordance with the attached Statement of Work (SOW) for IBWC computer equipment located at IBWC Headquarters and various field offices in different geographical locations for the period November 01, 2002 through October 30, 2003. Unit of Issue-Each. Quantity-25; Item No. 0002.  Supplies/Services-Service Call. Provide on-site maintenance and repairs on a per call routine basis, to include parts and labor, in accordance with the attached Statement of Work (SOW) for IBWC computer equipment located at IBWC Headquarters and various field offices in different geographical locations for Option Year 1 for the period November 01, 2003 through October 31, 2004 Unit of Issue-Each. Quantity-25; Item No. 0003. Supplies/Services-Service Call.  Provide on-site maintenance and repairs on a per call routine basis, to include parts and labor, in accordance with the attached Statement of Work (SOW) for IBWC computer equipment located at IBWC Headquarters and various field offices in different geographical locations for Option Year 2 for the period November 01, 2004 through October 31, 2005. Unit of Issue-Each. Quantity-25. The list of IBWC computer equipment (28 pages) is available upon request by interested individuals.  Oral, facsimile and electronic commerce-type delivery orders for Service Calls are authorized in the Schedule.  No drawings or schematics are available from this agency.  

The number of on-site non-emergency calls for on-site repairs for Fiscal Year 2002 (Oct 1, 2001 through Sep 30, 2002) was 22 service calls.  The number of routine service calls for on-site maintenance and repairs for Fiscal Year 2001 (Oct 1, 2000 through Sep 30, 2001) was 81 service calls.  Fiscal Year 2001 service calls were high in number due in part to aged equipment as compared to Fiscal Year 2002 service calls which were low in number due in part to new equipment.  IBWC estimates it will replace agency IT equipment at a rate of 25% per fiscal year, and has budgeted for this 25% rate of replacement.   

The Government estimates a minimum of 25 service calls will be made to the contractor per fiscal year for the base year and each of the two option years.  This estimate is not a representation to offerors that the estimated quantity of 25 service calls for the base year and each of the options years will be required or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal. Failure of the Government to order the estimated quantity of 25 service calls per base year and each of two option years will not entitle the contractor to any equitable adjustment in price.

FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Feb 2002), and 52.216-21, Requirements (Oct 1995), and are incorporated by reference.
