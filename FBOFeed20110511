<CONTACT>Tiffany K. Wulfsohn, Phone 202-685-5949, Fax (202) 685-5965, Email tiffany.wulfsohn@navy.mil
<DESC><p>The mission of the U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command (MSC) is to provide ocean transportation of equipment, fuel, supplies, and ammunition to sustain U.S. forces worldwide during peacetime and in war for as long as operational requirements dictate. During a contingency, more than 95 percent of all the equipment and supplies needed to sustain the U.S. military is carried by sea. As one of three TRANSCOM component commands, MSC provides the sea transportation to support the TRANSCOM mission. Numerous recent international crises underscored the vital role of MSC as a major contributor in the execution of U.S. national strategy. MSC operates an extensive fleet in support of Navy combatant forces, operates ships that provide Special Ocean mission support to U.S. Government agencies and operates ships loaded with military supplies and equipment that are prepositioned at strategic locations worldwide. MSC operates under two working capital funds (WCFs) for its distinct Navy and TRANSCOM business segments.</p>
<p>Within MSC, the Comptroller Directorate (N8) is responsible for providing Financial Management support to all MSC Functional Directorates and Program Managers. N8 must ensure that all MSC financial systems and the resultant financial data meet the requirements of MSC Management while complying with myriad financial guidance promulgated by the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of the Navy (DoN), and others. <br />In 2005, DoD initiated the Defense Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan to set the course for improving financial information and achieving audit readiness. The FIAR Plan has three goals: (1) provide timely, reliable, accurate, and relevant financial information; (2) sustain improvements through an effective internal control program; and (3) achieve unqualified audit opinions on DoD annual financial statements. <br />The Department of the Navy Financial Improvement Program (DON FIP) is a multi-year Department-wide effort to strengthen Navy-Marine Corps business processes and systems, transforming them to better serve worldwide operations. The program's goal is to produce financial information with greater accuracy, reliability, and accessibility. With this improved information, DON's senior leaders will be able to allocate the Department's resources in a better-informed, more precise way. Additionally, DON is engaged in a financial management transformation effort designed to resolve historical deficiencies, address new and emerging management challenges, and standardize Department-wide business processes. This initiative is being conducted in parallel with an effort to comply with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, Management's Responsibility for Internal Control. OMB Circular A-123 defines management's responsibility and accountability for internal control in Federal agencies and reflects policy recommendations developed by a joint committee of representatives from the Chief Financial Officer Council (CFOC) and the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE). The policy changes in this circular intend to strengthen the requirements for conducting management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting. The circular also emphasizes the need for agencies to integrate and coordinate internal control assessments with other internal control-related activities. Specifically, Appendix A of OMB Circular A-123 sets forth a methodology that agency management must follow to document, assess, test, and report on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.</p>
<p>The objective of this Performance Work Statement (PWS) is to obtain financial management support services for MSC's N8 Comptroller Directorate. Services provided under this PWS will include preparing the command to assert formal audit readiness for an independent financial audit, as well as support for MSC's accounting and budgeting policy, financial and feeder systems support, transactional support, process improvements, financial reporting, and program management support.</p>
<p>In addition to the following OMB Circular A-123 guidance, the Contractor shall refer to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and any and all applicable Government pronouncements, for example, DoD FIAR Plan, DoN FIP Program, GAO, PCIE financial and audit methods as set forth in the GAO/PCIE Financial Audit Manual (FAM) and the GAO Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM). OMB Circular A-123 implements and incorporates the CFO Act, Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA), Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), Inspector General Act of 1978 (IG Act), Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA), Improper Payment Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), and Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (CCA). These Government pronouncements are all available online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This RFP will be posted online at the Military Sealift Command Procurement website as well as the Federal Business Opportunities website on or around 21 May 2011.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br />The COAC Services Branch, Office of Acquisitions, DERA, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH, for the Framingham Heart Study under the NHLBI, Division of Intramural Research (DIR) Center for Population Studies, intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis for the purchase of custom kit containing Ovation Pico WTA System Encore Biotin module, and Exon Module ~96rxn.
<p>The reference number: NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2011-173-DDC.</p>
<p>Background:<br />Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and serious illness in the United States. In 1948, the Framingham Heart Study -- under the direction of the National Heart Institute (now known as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; NHLBI) -- embarked on an ambitious project in health research. At the time, little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke, but the death rates for CVD had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the century and had become an American epidemic.</p>
<p>The objective of the Framingham Heart Study was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke. The Framingham Heart Study continues to make important scientific contributions by enhancing its research capabilities and capitalizing on its inherent resources. New diagnostic technologies, such as echocardiography (an ultrasound examination of the heart), carotid-artery ultrasound, bone densitometry (for monitoring osteoporosis), and computerized tomography of the coronary arteries, are evaluated and integrated into ongoing protocols.</p>
<p><br />Purpose:<br />This acquisition is for the purpose of procurement of Nugen reagents, reagents necessary to process paxgene RNA samples to conduct gene expression profiling. The project will involve the procurement of reagents for 2400 samples.<br />Period of Performance: May 16, 2011- Jul 31, 2011</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements: <br />A. Contractor shall provide the reagents and enzymes to process blood samples which would be used on Affymetrix gene chips.<br />B. The Contractor shall provide the necessary technical support during the sample processing step and the required internal controls for use as a quality control measure.</p>
<p>II. Government Responsibilities <br />A. NHLBI will inspect each kit and determine if the supplied enzymes and buffers are adequate for processing samples.</p>
<p>III. Reporting Requirements and Deliverables <br />A. Prepared cDNA target using the Nugen kit would be QCed in NHLBI for concentration and integrity using a spectrophotometer and bioanalyzer.<br />B. Samples that have passed the QC would be hybridized to gene chips for further analysis.</p>
<p>Program Management and Control Requirements <br />No special management or control systems are required under this contract.</p>
<p>Items to be purchased:</p>
<p>Item Number: 9010 Custom kit containing Ovation Pico WTA System Encore Biotin module, and Exon Module~96rxn, quantity 25 each</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact the National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The Framingham SABRe CVD Initiative Study under the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of NIH is conducting a study to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) by following the development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who have not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke. The study will expand research to include genomic biomarkers in CVD and will collaborate with other leading researchers across the country and world on various projects, such as, stroke and dementia, osteoporosis and arthritis and genetic patterns of common diseases. The collaborative study in biomarkers will analyze 7000 samples on Human Exon arrays to identify different expressed genes and associated alternative splicing events using the Affymetrix Platform. Specifically, the study will identify genes with altered expressions in heart, lung, and blood disorders and in a parallel study alternative splicing events during the disease process. The studies will be conducted in phases and the intent is to analyze gene expression in WBCs blood samples (n=2400) from Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants. Therefore, NHLBI is in need of NuGEN Technologies WT-Ovation Pico RNA Amplification System Automation to amplify 50 ng of total RNA from whole blood. The WT-Ovation Exon Module (60rx) will be used in preparation of labeled cDNA target to hybridize to Exon genechips. NuGEN Technologies is the only company that manufacturers these reagents. The Ovation&reg; System family of products is covered by U.S. Patent Nos. 6,692,918, 6,251,639 and 6,946,251, and other issued and pending US and international patents. These are the only reagents that are suitable for the existing affymetrix platform operated in the core facility and the reagents have been validated in the core lab. In order to maintain a high standard of quality and reproducibility of experiments while increasing data output, the reagents manufactured by NuGEN is of critical importance.</p>
<p><br /><br />The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology with size standard of 500 employees; the small business set-aside does apply for this requirement.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition <br />procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-50 (May 6, 2011).</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to Childrens National Medical Center, 111 Michigan Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20010 for a pediatric neuromuscular clinical and research nurse practitioner.

The Neuromuscular and Neurogenetic Disorders of Childhood Section (NNDCS) is part of the Neurogenetics Branch at the NINDS. The major focus in this section lies on muscle disorders of early childhood, with a particular focus on the congenital myopathies and the congenital muscular dystrophies. Together, this group of disorders is one of the most important contributors to early childhood neuromuscular morbidity. Work in the laboratory part of the section concentrates on the molecular characterization of these disorders as well as on the exploration of preclinical models of therapeutic interventions. Work in the clinical part of the section is devoted to the recruitment of a large cohort of patients and their clinical characterization, the clinical characterization of new forms of congenital muscle disease, careful natural history studies in defined patient groups, the definition of clinical standards of care to harmonize natural history data, the evaluation and standardization of outcome measures and establishment of common data elements to lay the grounds for clinical trial readiness, and the development of biomarkers, in particular imaging based biomarkers. 

In order to accomplish all of these goals, the NNDCS is expanding its clinical reach to collaborate closely with the neuromuscular program at Childrens National Medical Center (CNMC) in Washington DC, which is currently under research funds with NINDS.  Screening and recruitment of patients will take place both at the NIH as well as at CNMC where the Principal Investigator will also be seeing patients. Furthermore, patients screened and recruited at the NIH will also have to be seen at CNMC, in particular for the MRI based muscle imaging part of the protocol, and patients seen and recruited at CNMC will have to be seen at the NIH as well for specialized muscle imaging using ultrasound as well as for the application of the various clinical outcome measures.

The program is in great need for a clinical and research nurse practitioner to function on multiple levels in this combined clinical research scenario.  The practitioner will (1) see and evaluate new and follow-up patients with neuromuscular and neurogenetic disorders of childhood, (2) manage and chart combined clinical/research visits, (3) follow-up on testing and referrals initiated on patient and research subjects, document and interpret the results, (4) respond to family or patient calls and respond to medical aspects of pre-visit inquiries, (5) facilitate coordination of imaging studies, biomarker collection and clinical outcome evaluations between CNMC and NIH, including sedated MRI studies at CNMC, (6) attend weekly clinical meetings at the NIH, (7) record, collate, summarize and report clinical research data on patients, with particular focus on Natural History trials, clinical trials, and clinical outcome research, and (8) develop clinical research protocols, including protocols for natural history studies, clinical outcome studies and establishment and tracking of standards of care.

The CNMC currently has staff, in particular, Meganne Leach, RN, MSN, CRNP to provide these services.  Ms. Leach will be based at CNMC as well as at NIH and will serve as a clinical specialist in the screening and evaluation of children with suspected congenital muscle disease. This role requires a trained and skilled individual, requiring training in pediatric neurology and in pediatric neuromuscular disorders, with a focus on congenital muscle disease and extensive exposure to this unique patient population. She has experience in independently evaluating children with neuromuscular disease and in following patients under established natural history research protocols. Meganne Leach has been involved in organizing and supervising the only patient meeting in the US devoted to congenital muscular dystrophy and she has been actively seeing patients in the only clinic devoted to congenital muscle disease. In this role, she has evaluated a large number of patients within this particular group. In addition, she has helped to develop and apply tools for evaluation and clinical care for this population. Ms. Leach has extensive experience in neuromuscular clinical research, including regulatory experience and roles in neuromuscular natural history and clinical trial protocols.  

The Period of Performance is 12 months.

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures using FAR Part 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by submitting a statement of capabilities on or before 3:00 PM E.T., May 26, 2011 to Korriise LaRoche, larochek@mail.nih.gov.  All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NINDS to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting quotes, on behalf of Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for Atlantic Salmon Postsmolt Trawl Survey support for projects relative to the Northeast fisheries.
<p>The objectives of the 2011 Atlantic Salmon Postsmolt Survey Cruise are to (1) estimate the distribution and migration pathways of Atlantic salmon postsmolts, (2) determine the physiological status of Atlantic salmon postsmolts during marine transition, and (3) collect a variety of biological samples and ecosystem based data in the study area. The primary vessel (vessel leading pair trawl events) and secondary vessels must be able to carry at least 4 scientists for a minimum of seven days with the option of up to 15 total days. There will also be the option of up to 20 days for a continuation of the survey in 2012. Both vessels shall be made available for 6 hours for staging in Woods Hole during a period from 7am - 7pm prior to the cruise and for 6 hours during a period from 7am - 7pm for de-staging in Woods Hole at the end of the lease period. A more detailed description of each vessel's general requirements, each vessel's operational requirements for the cruise and the each vessel's scientific-related capabilities and requirements are provided below.</p>
<p>The survey will mainly consist of pair-trawling a modified pelagic trawl net as provided by the Government, to live-capture Atlantic salmon postsmolts exiting the Penobscot River and traveling through the Gulf of Maine enroute to West Greenland. All relevant trawl information will be collected on standardized NEFSC trawl logs. The catch will be processed while enroute to the next sampling station, according to the sampling plan. All catch is the property of the US Government and no catch shall be retained except for scientific samples. These samples will remain the property of the US Government and at the completion of the cruise will be remove from the vessels and transferred to the NEFSC Woods Hole laboratory for further processing. At selected stations, physical and biological oceanographic samples shall be collected. Groundfishing shall also take place on the secondary vessel while the catch is worked up on the primary vessel. Physical oceanographic parameters shall be monitored and measured through CTD casts. Weather observations, surface salinity samples and bottom salinity samples may also be collected at selected stations. Bongo plankton net tows shall also be conducted at selected stations using standard NEFSC protocol. The secondary vessel may be required to provide groundfish nets and necessary gear for groundfishing which will be determined by the COTR in consultation with the Master. Additionally, both vessels shall provide equipment and expertise normally associated with fishing operations related to minor repairs of fishing equipment including extra cable and rigging gear (shackles, hammerlocks, thimbles, net twine, net needles, equipment required for welding repairs, etc). The vessels shall also provide air compression capabilities capable of inflating poly-floats and pressure washing equipment to wash nets. The government shall supply the surface trawl gear, hardware (hammerlocks, swivels, triangles, etc), bridles, cable and other rigging from the end of the trawl warps through the cod end of the net plus extra cable and rigging gear (shackles, hammerlocks, thimbles, net twine, net needles, equipment required for welding repairs, etc).</p>
<p>The proposed contract is 100% total small business set aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the acquisition is 483112 Deep Sea Passenger Transportation. The small business size standard is 500 employees. The solicitation and proposed fixed price contract will be issued utilizing the test procedures identified in FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program For Certain Commercial Items and will be evaluated on a best value basis wherein the following factors 1 -&nbsp;5 listed in descending order, when combined, are significantly more important than price: (1) Vessel characteristics and configuration (2) Vessel's commercial fishing history fishing (3) Master and crew's work experience and qualifications (4) Past Performance (5) Pertinent vessel documentation including stability letter, marine insurance coverage, and structural survey or insurance inspection and (6) Price.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quote that shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This is a SOLICITATION:The U.S. Geological Survey, Geologic Discipline, Denver, CO, requires an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) with Deep UV Wavelength Coverage; optical emission spectrometer (ICP-DES). The instrument will be used in the characterization of geological, environmental and biological materials for a wide variety of applications as part of the mandated research programs of CMERSC and other parts of the USGS. This instrument will add to capabilities of the existing Laser Ablation ICP facility.  Quotations shall provide technical details and pricing of:  The standard instrument being offered to the USGS, including spare parts, software costs, installation costs, training costs and warranty. All equipment, software or other options necessary to meet the specifications outlined below shall be included in the quotations:  The installed ICP-OES shall meet the specifications upon installation: The ICP-DES must be equipped with an ICP generator that is fully computer controlled and shall be capable of at least 0.7 to 1.6 kW power.  The spectrometer shall be capable of simultaneous measurements of all parts of the spectral range.  Since the system is intended for use with laser ablation (LA) work, moving/switching slits or optics to cover different parts of the spectral range sequentially is not acceptable. The spectrometer shall be capable of making simultaneous measurements in the deep UV (DUV) range down to 130 nm.  The full spectral range shall be at least 130 nm to 700 nm.  The spectrometer shall be thermally controlled for stability.  The ICP torch interface shall be compatible with a variety of torch adapter configurations that allow direct coupling to all commercially available LA systems.The ICP torch shall be mounted in the radial orientation.  The spectral data and results shall be able to be viewed within the ICP software and also exported as raw data files (comma delimited text, etc.) that shall be accessed using standard data processing software such as Excel or MATLAB.  The system shall be capable of acquiring more than 50 wavelengths simultaneously at a frequency of 10Hz.  The system shall include correction equations in the software such as lEC and background corrections.  The system shall be capable of initiating or receiving a trigger signal from a New Wave Research, a Photon Machines and a CETAC Technologies laser ablation system for automated analysis and synchronized acquisition timings.

<a href="mailto:Scott.W.Britt@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Seattle</a>
<DESC>The Seattle District, US Army Corps of Engineers requires the removal of up to three bridges at the Union Slough, Section 1135 Restoration Project in Everett, Washington.<br><br>Background: The Union Slough Bridge Removal Project is located adjacent to the Union Slough sub-channel of the Snohomish River in the City of Everett, on Smith Island in Snohomish County, Washington. Smith Island is located in the Snohomish River estuary, east of downtown Everett and Interstate 5.  <br>The existing levee was breached along Union Slough in three locations and pedestrian bridges were constructed at each of the three 180-foot breaches.  Tidal connections in the sites have not established as planned.  The site floods as designed during high tide but does not adequately drain during low tides.  <br><br>Project Description: The Union Slough Bridge Removal Project will consist of relocation and paving along the setback levee, removal of three pedestrian bridges, removal of remnant levee material along the slough side of the breaches, and the creation of additional low flow channels within the estuary that will facilitate more rapid and complete drainage between tide cycles.<br>The Corps will allow the contractor to determine means and methods within established performance criteria. The Corps will develop a basic plan and sequence and establish water quality criteria for the contractor. Contractors will determine which equipment and techniques would best allow them to complete the project within the prescribed time-line while meeting the specific performance criteria.<br>Because of elevation requirements, to open up the breaches for more complete drainage and the predicted tide elevations, it will be necessary to either isolate the work areas or operate within the breach areas during wet conditions. Discussions with National Marine Fishery Service, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, and Washington Department of Ecology, determined that isolation of the estuary was not preferred.  Although isolation of a single site may be allowed.<br>It is anticipated that the project will include the use of silt screens along the slough along with localized isolation techniques to allow working in a wet environment. Temporary bypass roads and turnarounds may be constructed near the south and central bridge within the City's jurisdictional boundaries. All work on the northern bridge would be from existing levee access roads.   Contractors may use existing bridges at their own risk.<br><br>The recommended plan includes the following measures to address the existing conditions and achieve the expected ecosystem restoration benefits at the Union Slough site:<br><br>Remove the three bridges that now span the three dike breaches in the levee along the west bank of Union Slough.  Bridge removal will include the demolition and removal of the concrete arches that make up the bridge spans. The footings and three-foot thick geogrid foundation material will be removed.  The estimated earthwork for the geogrid and remnant levee material removal is approximately 4,500 CY per breach.<br><br>Temporary access road construction may be utilized to provide better through-access for hauling bridge debris and waste materials.  These features would only occur at the southern and central bridge locations, within the City's jurisdictional boundaries.  Access roads would require the temporary placement of approximately 600 CY of spalls and surfacing material per breach.<br><br>Paving of the pedestrian trail (an asphalt pavement path) approximately 750 feet west of its current location to run along the top of the levee on the east side of the Everett Water Pollution Control Facility.  A six foot tall chain-link fence will be constructed to provide security for the treatment facility.<br><br>Create additional tidal channels in the site to improve hydraulic connectivity. Internal channel construction will include the excavation of low flow channels at specific locations to allow better drainage of internal areas. These channels would be approximately 8' wide and one to three feet deep.<br><br>Remove remnant levee material near breaches to improve hydraulic capacity.  Remnant levee material removal will include the removal of material along the slough side of each breach. This will allow free drainage along the full span of the breach.<br><br>The estimated cost range for this project is $1,000,000 to $5,000,000.<br><br>This project is open to HUBZONE business ONLY. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237310 with a size standard of $33.5 million, which means that, for the purposes of this procurement, a firm is a small business if its annual average gross revenue, taken for the last 3 fiscal years, does not exceed $33.5 million. For information concerning NAICS and SBA size standards, go to http://www.sba.gov<br><br>Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), the solicitation will be available for download no earlier than 15 days following the issue date of this announcement. There is no technical information available until the issue of the solicitation via the Internet.<br><br>Issue of the solicitation will be in electronic format only. No disks or hard copy will be available. Follow the registration procedures at www.fbo.gov to receive notification of solicitation/amendment posting.<br><br>Address administrative questions to Scott Britt, Contract Specialist. Ask NO technical questions; answers to technical questions are only available through an online system during the solicitation process.

<a href="mailto:Phyllis.L.Buerstatte@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Walla Walla</a>
<DESC>Construction Project: McNary JBS Outfall Pipe Relocation.  Work consists of relocating the juvenile fish bypass outfall at McNary Dam on the Columbia River near Umatilla, Oregon.  The contract will relocate the juvenile fish bypass outfall from its current location about 250 feet downstream from the dam in front of the powerhouse to a new location about 1100 feet downstream from the dam and 1200 feet away from the bank out into the river.  The new pipeline will be comprised of three different sections.  At the upstream end of the modification, just after the fish are routed through a primary/secondary switchgate, the primary bypass pipe will be replaced with 900 feet of 36-inch covered, corrugated metal flume elevated anywhere from 39 feet above the ground at the upstream end to ground level at the downstream end.  The 900-foot length of the flume includes about 250 feet within an elongated circular loop to limit rate of descent.  The flume will be supported by steel support structures spaced from 50 to 58 feet apart.  The steel supports will stand on concrete footings set into the ground.  The flume transitions to a fabricated steel junction box where the secondary bypass pipe rejoins the primary bypass pipe after leaving the juvenile fish facility.  After the junction box, the bypass pipe goes underground in a 42 inch high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe for a distance of 950 feet.  After the HDPE pipe daylights at the western end of the run, the pipe transitions to a 36 inch smooth steel pipe that turns north and continues out over the water for a distance of approximately 1320 feet.  The overwater portion is supported on drilled shaft, cast-in-place reinforced concrete piers spaced about 55 feet apart.  The piers will generally be in water depths of 20 to 25 feet except for the final pier near the end of the outfall.  That pier will support the pipe in a water depth of about 55 feet or more.   The invert of the overwater portion of the pipeline will generally be about 11 feet above the water surface when the river is at the average tailwater elevation.   Support piers will be required to extend a minimum of 10 feet into bedrock.  <br>In addition to the relocation of the outfall, the contractor will also be required to modify a number of pipes within the juvenile fish facility.  These pipes are generally smaller in diameter, usually either steel or plastic pipe.  Most of these pipelines are elevated as well and steel supports/concrete footings will be required.    Contract requirements will also include demolition of existing pipelines to be abandoned within the juvenile fish facility as well as the existing outfall pipe and supports, including the underwater portion of the supports.<br>Contract activities required include material acquisition and delivery, off-site fabrication of aluminum and steel hydraulic control structures and steel pipe supports, reinforced concrete placement, welding, crane work,  pipe joint treatment, paint prep and painting, in-water construction, barge-mounted crane work,  construction of reinforced concrete retaining walls, trenching and backfill, relocation of a comfort station drainfield, landscape restoration, installation of valves and water control mechanisms in the juvenile fish facility, electrical work, and on-site component assembly as well as miscellaneous associated tasks.  Pipe slopes and alignments are critical to the performance of the completed system and will require tight tolerances during construction.  Work conditions will include hazardous work such as elevated work, work on or over water, work under water, confined spaces, and cold or icy weather.<br>The in-water work window is expected to be 01 Nov 2011 through 31 March 2012.  The Juvenile Fish Facility will be shut down on 15 Dec 2011 and then is scheduled to be in operation on 15 March 2012.  Commissioning of the work is expected to be completed by 12 March 2012.<br>This project will be incrementally funded.   Request for Proposals No. W912EF-11-R-0016 will be posted to the FBO website on or about 20 June 2011.   Proposals will be due no sooner than 30 calendar days after actual solicitation issuance date.

It has no relationship to the actual proposal due date. The proposal due date will be contained in the solicitation and any solicitation amendments that may be issued. A site visit will be offered approximately 2 weeks after the solicitation is made available to bidders. See solicitation for details about the site visit.  The proposal evaluation method will be Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA).  The non-price evaluation factors the Government will use to evaluate proposals are expected to  include offeror's record of  experience and successful past performance in performing work of this type. Solicitation is open to both large and small business concerns. NAICS code for this project is 237990, and the small business size standard is $33.5 million or less in average annual receipts.

Specifically, we are interested in investigating the following issues that have tremendous impact on aligning where our organization is focused and where our organization should be heading in the near and long term.

1.	Strategic forecasting of customer demand - our customers demand for services has increased exponentially over the last couple years.  We need an algorithm(s) developed to help us forecast the overall demand for services, as well as a tiered structural breakdown of the type of services requested by customer demographics.

2.	Focused analytics to provide targeted resource identification - based upon our customers increasing demand for services, we need a capacity model to inform our leadership of the amount and of type of labor, capital, and technology resources needed to produce throughput at an equal level to customer demand.

3.	Labor market analysis to determine strategic locations for investment - currently our organization operates in numerous locations with a tremendous amount of variation in customer demand and location productivity.  We need to undertake an analysis that identifies the best locations/methods to recruit talent, as well as to provide targeted services for our customer base.

4.	Cost/benefit analysis related to policies and programs - our organization needs to evaluate policy and program outcomes in terms of service to our customers versus the internal/external cost of producing our products.

<p>Notice Type: <br />Sources Sought</p>
<p><br />AN ASSESSMENT OF THE ROLES AND EFFECTIVENESS OF COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Notice for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service intends to issue a competitive small business set-aside procurement for advisory and assistance services to conduct an assessment of the roles and effectiveness of community-based organizations in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Preference will be given to small businesses.</p>
<p>SNAP is a federal nutrition assistance program that serves low- and no-income households. The program provides a nutrition safety net that helps alleviate food insecurity and increase access to healthy foods. Although the program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, individual states have operational responsibility for eligibility determinations, benefit issuance and case management.</p>
<p>SNAP serves more than one in seven Americans. In December 2010, nearly 44.1 million people received SNAP benefits, an increase of nearly 487,000 people from November. December is the twenty-sixth consecutive month that more people received SNAP benefits than at any time previously in the history of the program.</p>
<p>Concurrent with this steady increase in SNAP participation, states are also experiencing declining resources and daunting fiscal challenges. The worst recession since the 1930s has caused the steepest decline in state tax receipts on record at the same time the need for services has increased dramatically. As a result, even after making very deep spending cuts over the last several years, states continue to face large budget gaps. States will continue to struggle to find the revenue needed to support critical public services for a number of years, threatening the well-being of many low-income families.</p>
<p>The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has taken several steps to facilitate efficient eligibility determination and case management through policy simplifications and providing waivers to states. States have also taken several measures to improve customer service and to deliver benefits more efficiently. These administrative and programmatic changes have included, but are not limited to, the postponement and/or waiver of the face-to-face interview at certification and recertification, shorter interviews, online eligibility screening and application completion, longer certification periods, reduction in required documentation, shortened application forms, electronic case files, and call centers. In addition to these policy, organization and technological changes, states have also developed a variety of partnerships with CBOs to improve the delivery of services to clients.</p>
<p>CBOs are non-governmental non-profit organizations that operate within a local community. Many are staffed by a combination of paid and unpaid personnel, while smaller organizations are fully staffed by volunteers. These organizations vary in size and offer a full range of community service programs. Over the past few years, CBOs have become increasingly involved with assisting SNAP applicants with the application process. Their roles vary widely, from making informational materials about SNAP available to their clients to providing direct assistance to SNAP applicants. Some also provide computers where applicants can access the application online. Others provide telephone and fax machines so that SNAP applicants can copy and fax documents, as needed. Many CBOs provide application assistance to SNAP applicants which includes assistance completing the application and gathering the necessary documentation.</p>
<p>To date, six states - Massachusetts, Florida, Texas, Michigan, Minnesota, and Nevada - have received waivers to allow CBOs to conduct interviews with SNAP applicants. None of these waivers are statewide. Some waivers apply to all SNAP applicants in designated parts of the state and others pertain to specific subgroups.</p>
<p>This procurement will compare program outcomes when CBOs conduct applicant interviews with program outcomes when SNAP staff conduct interviews in selected states. Key outcomes on which comparisons will be made include frequency of application denials for procedural reasons, application processing timeliness, payment accuracy, customer satisfaction, and customer experiences with the CBOs and the SNAP offices. FNS expects that between three and six states will participate in this study. All six states with waivers to partner with CBOs to conduct interviews with SNAP applicants will be invited to participate in the study.</p>
<p>The study objectives are:</p>
<p>1. Describe the CBOs conducting SNAP interviews and the nature of their partnerships with state and local SNAP agencies.<br />2. Describe the response of State SNAP staff to the involvement of CBOs in conducting applicant interviews.<br />3. Describe the response of CBO interviewers to their involvement with SNAP.<br />4. Describe the response of SNAP applicants who are interviewed by CBO staff for SNAP benefits to the involvement of CBOs in SNAP.<br />5. Describe the services that the CBOs offer?<br />6. Document the impacts of CBOs conducting SNAP interviews on program outcomes.</p>
<p>Information for this impact study should come from:</p>
<p>&bull; extant administrative data;<br />&bull; new administrative record keeping such as a tracking system for applications that are submitted by the CBOs;<br />&bull; site visits for CBO and SNAP office observations and to interview key SNAP and CBO staff, and SNAP applicants; and<br />&bull; survey data from SNAP applicants, SNAP staff and CBO staff.</p>
<p>Evaluation samples of SNAP applicants and QC case records must be randomly selected and large enough to detect both, statistically significant and meaningful differences between both groups.</p>
<p>FNS is seeking firms with the capability of:<br />&bull; designing and conducting multi-mode data collection, <br />&bull; manage and analyze both qualitative and quantitative data<br />&bull; conducting surveys, <br />&bull; managing and analyzing large data sets, <br />&bull; producing a high quality report, and<br />&bull; establishing successful relationships with state and local SNAP offices and with CBOs.</p>
<p>The firm must demonstrate the availability of adequate staff who are experienced in disciplines critical to the successful completion of the study objectives, including project management, evaluation design, survey methods, data collection techniques (including recruitment and training of field staff), descriptive and inferential statistics, and database management.</p>
<p>Finally, the firm must demonstrate an understanding of the special requirements of working with state and local SNAP offices and of the culture and environment of CBOs.</p>
<p>Interested parties may submit capability statements that demonstrate its ability to perform all elements of the requirements as described in this notice. In addition, your response must include a description of your past experience on at least three (3) similar projects consistent in scope, size and complexity with this requirement which you performed in the past three years; and description of staff experience and skills.</p>
<p>The Statement of Capabilities should also include:</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor Name<br />&bull; Address<br />&bull; Point of Contact (POC)<br />&bull; POC phone number and email address<br />&bull; DUNS number, and<br />&bull; Business status (i.e., large/small business, disadvantaged, Hub Zone, woman-owed, etc.)<br />&bull; GSA MOBIS schedule ( If your firm has GSA MOBIS schedule)</p>
<p>Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of offeror submission of responses, or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP. No questions will be entertained or comment responded to by the Government. Offerors capable of providing these services should submit the information requested above via e-mail to ty.sar@fns.usda.gov and no later than 2PM Eastern Standard Time, May 25, 2011.</p>
<p>Please limit the length of the packages to 20 pages. Packages over 20 pages will not be evaluated. <br />&emsp;<br />Attachment<br />Additional Information on Procurement</p>
<p>Scope of Study</p>
<p>FNS expects that between three and six states will participate in this study. All six states with waivers to partner with CBOs to conduct interviews with SNAP applicants will be invited to participate in the study. Every effort will be made to recruit at least three of the six states. This study will compare relevant program outcomes associated with CBO-conducted applicant interviews CBOs with outcomes observed when interviews are conducted by SNAP staff. Outcomes that will be examined include frequency of denials for procedural reasons, application timeliness, payment accuracy, customer satisfaction, and customer experience with the CBOs and the SNAP offices. <br />Data shall be collected from different sources and through a variety of methods, including but not limited to:<br />&bull; extant administrative data;<br />&bull; new administrative record keeping such as a tracking system for applications that are submitted by the CBOs;<br />&bull; site visits for CBO and SNAP office observations and to interview key SNAP and CBO staff, and SNAP applicants; and<br />&bull; survey data from SNAP applicants, SNAP staff and CBO staff.</p>
<p>Evaluation samples of SNAP applicants and QC case records must be randomly selected and large enough to detect both, statistically significant and meaningful differences between both groups.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602</p>

ENGINEERING PATIENT SAFETY REVIEWS

1.	Background: 
Patient safety is a continuous process that needs to be an integral component within healthcare delivery systems.  Healthcare information technology (HIT) has been recognized as a key factor in enabling healthcare facilities to have the ability to provide accurate and usable information to assist clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, allied health care professionals and other personnel that interact with and provide quality care to patients.  Patient safety is focused on measuring, monitoring, and improving the safety of the IT products and processes in support of the medical providers and IT users and ultimately, of the patients.  Therefore, the OI&A Informatics Patient Safety program seeks qualified human factors expertise to incorporate safety principles using best practices such as user centered design based upon human factors engineering principles and best practices. This expertise will also include the incorporation of usability testing into the development, and pre/post-release evaluation process.

<DESC>TO: ALL Potential Respondents-This is a draft RFI, however no changes are anticipated and response date will remain the same
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Information (RFI) Regarding SMC Development Planning Directorate's (SMC/XR) Reusable Booster System (RBS) High-Thrust Main Engine requirement.</p>
<p>1. The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Directorate of Development Planning (XR), Los Angeles Air Force Base, California is seeking information from interested parties on liquid booster engines and associated technologies which satisfy the preliminary requirements of the RBS. XR is seeking an existing engine system, not a future developmental concept.</p>
<p>2. The purpose of this RFI is to gather information on rocket engine options that could be used as the RBS main propulsion system or that could potentially replace the RD-180 main engine on the Atlas V EELV (Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle). SMC is only interested in receiving information on those engines whose intellectual property rights for technology, design, and production are wholly owned by a United States corporation in order to support National Security Space missions. This Request for Information (RFI) is for market research purposes.</p>
<p>3. In order for SMC to develop the most cost effective on-ramp strategy, inputs from industry on potential propulsion options and enabling technologies are essential. To ensure that cost, schedule and performance constraints are considered, we request that information pertaining to each of these specific areas be addressed for those designs which meet the following overall requirements to be addressed in response to this RFI:</p>
<p>a. The contractor must possess and demonstrate to the Government full engine ownership of all design and production intellectual property rights to support domestic production without end use restrictions<br />b. Engine propellants must be LOX/RP<br />c. Sea level thrust 300 - 500-klbs<br />d. Sea level thrust to weight &gt; 85<br />e. Sea level Isp &gt; 300 seconds<br />a. Vacuum Isp &gt; 330 seconds<br />b. Engine reuse threshold of 10 missions with another 10 missions after overhaul<br />c. High reusable engine reliability with minimal per flight touch labor<br />d. Engine must operate at throttle levels down to 50% rated thrust<br />e. In-flight restart capability is of significant interest</p>
<p>4. Interested industry respondents are requested to provide a White Paper that includes the following sections written in Microsoft Word 2000 or later or Adobe Acrobat Exchange Portable Document Format (.pdf) (with copy/paste function enabled):</p>
<p>a. Technical Description: Identify assemblies, components, and subsystems including physical dimensions, weight and power requirements.<br />b. Technology assessment: Assess the technology critical to engine design using Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) to the subsystem level whenever possible. In order to minimize misinterpretation of TRL levels, provide a brief narrative of the current state of maturity of each major component, unit and interface. When possible, describe the heritage of each assembly/component and interface, particularly its pedigree in proven space flight.<br />c. Expected Performance: Assess proposed engine system against system requirements listed in paragraph 3 above.<br />d. Development Schedule: Identify proposed schedule to include critical paths and discuss schedule drivers (e.g. long lead items). Supporting information from previous similar programs should be provided.<br />e. Cost Estimate: Provide a basis for budgetary estimates on the proposed engine system. Include: Confidence level, Basis of Estimate, heritage program(s) from which costs are derived, and cost risk and drivers.<br />f. Risk Analysis: Discuss the risks and mitigation plans associated with the proposed system including any risk and mitigation strategies required for integration and manufacturing<br />g. Intellectual Property Rights:<br />o Provide a description on the origin of engine design and production rights. If all or portions of the engine technology are derived from foreign sources, describe how the appropriate intellectual rights were acquired to produce the engine within the United States without legal dispute (e.g., licensing agreement). Also provide a description of the level of the data rights (i.e. unlimited rights, restricted rights), expiration timeframes (if any), end use agreements, etc.<br />o If the contractor proposes an engine whose intellectual property is not currently owned by a U.S. corporation, then specify the proposed licensing process, reviews, approvals, cost (to include manufacturing risk reduction), and schedule required to satisfy paragraph 3a.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302 and 5.203(a), this notice advertises the government's intent to award a non-competitive contract to Pioneer Energy Products, LLC (dba PEPRO) for a telecommunications shelter.  The full justification for non-competitive procurement is below.
Comments and questions regarding this sole source procurement may be directed to Sarah Welch, Contracting Officer, at sarah_welch@nps.gov.  Include your business name, product information, and point of contact.  All comments received on or before May 26, 2011, will be considered.  
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $150,000 (See FAR 13.106-1)
1.  Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost): - One PEPRO walk-in shelter with attached 30 ft tower. The cost of the shelter is $58,397.00 plus shipping, which is estimated at $6,379.00.   (The park will explore cheaper shipping by government bill of lading.) - Building will be used to house delicate radio communications equipment in a remote mountaintop location, thus providing the park with improved operational and safety communications in compliance with narrowband directives. - Building will be flown to the site by helicopter. - Site is located on United States Forest Service (USFS) property just outside the national park boundary.
2.  Sole Source Justification rationale 
___XX	Only one responsible source: Pioneer Energy Products dba PEPRO (DUNS 052756389)___XX	Urgent and compelling circumstances exist. 
Both apply.  There is only one responsible source and there are compelling circumstances.  In a joint effort to share radio site resources with the USFS per OCIO Directive 2005-010, this building has been specified by the USFS and will meet both agencies' requirements. 
This procurement is a small, but very critical, part of the overall NOCA radio system narrowband conversion project.  This shelter will be installed on Lookout Mountain, in Skagit county WA, in cooperation with the US Forest Service. The narrowband digital equipment it will house is susceptible to harm from external threats like lightning, radio frequency interference, passive inter-modulation, and electro-magnetic radiation and pulses. The installation must be completed before the winter snow, when winds and icing of the repeaters may cause them to fail and communications required for park management and operations will be lost. The new shelter will be a shared facility with USFS and therefore must also meet their electronic site shelter requirements.  USFS uses PEPRO shelters as their standard for remote radio installations.
Physical requirements and specifications:-  6'x6'x8' all welded walk-in shelter-  2" insulation in walls and ceiling-  36"x80" lockable walk-through door-  Two passive intake/exhaust vents to the outside-  Building mounting system will minimize the amount of  ground disturbance; no foundation required-  Leveling jacks and ballast baskets on all four corners-  Building must employ a faraday cage system and be filtered and shielded  for EMI and RFI protection-  Lifting rings provided for aerial transportation to site.Interior and electrical layout:-  Two interior DC lights-  One 19"x6' electronic equipment rack fastened to the floor with DC power distribution buss bar for both positive and negative-  Power entry point will be rated at Mu-80 shielded or better-  Six 100 amp filters-  Two 30 data storage suppressors-  Lightning Technology grounding kitCable entry:  Nine cable entry ports with shielded entry gland system and unused port covers.Tower:-  Must have an integrated articulated tower structure capable of being raised and lowered by one person and extending 30 ' tall-  6" antenna mounts with 18" antenna standoffs.Solar power mounting:-  Uni-rail solar panel bracket wall mount.  Mounted on South side with door on the East side.-  Uni-rail solar panel mount roof mount-  Adjustable solar panel brackets.Product lead time:  Delivery date is approximately 100 days ARO.  The installation location will become snow-bound in early October.  Shelter must be ordered prior to June 3.
3.  Market Research.  The NPS Telecomm Shop at Olympic NP has done extensive research to find shelters for sites in Washington, Oregon and Idaho.  Our search has included GSA contracts and contacting other government agencies.  There are other manufactures of communications shelters within a reasonable price range, however, they do not meet the specific requirements stated above for either NPS or the USFS for this site.  A search of the internet, canvas of other agency communications facility managers, visiting an international communications trade show to view other manufacturers' products turned up no other manufacturer that can meet the critical as well as the other specific requirements.
The critical requirements summarized from the list above are as follows; - Integrated articulated 30 foot tower.   This tower is mounted to the building to eliminate ground disturbance.  It also can be raised and lowered by one person for safer maintenance of antennas. - Building is an all metal, welded, uni-body construction to withstand the very harsh environment at its intended location and includes 2" of insulation to protect batteries and sensitive equipment. - Building has an integrated shielding system to protect the equipment from external EMI and RFI forces. - Building foundation structure is such that it minimizes ground disturbance while providing a very stable structure.  This is accomplished by leveling legs on each corner and the use of ballast baskets on each foot for stability.
4.  If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:a.	Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist.b.	The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $150,000 (See FAR 13.106-1)

Date:  ____05/11-2011_____                 PR Number: 1574-11-3037

1.  Nature and/or description of the item/service being procured and its intended use (include the anticipated cost):YNP needs to have the right and left steer/ braking problem inspected diagnosed and repaired as per original manufacture Caterpillar procedures and instructions. The D7G dozer is used to remove winter snow accumulations (up to 30 feet) from Yellowstone National Park (YNP) roads. The D7G is used to push snow into large rotary snow plows that blow the snow off the roadways. The snow must be removed from the road ways in a safe and timely manner so that the visitors to YNP can enjoy the Park per published opening dates set by Park Management and its Partners in a safe manner.The estimate to repair the brake turning system on this D7G dozer is $14,000 dollars for the driver and curb side brake systems. If the repair facility needs to replace parts in the final drive assembly the total cost could be as much as $20,000 dollars.
2.  Sole Source Justification rationale  (Check one and explain below):
______	Only one responsible source. ____X__	Urgent and compelling circumstances exist. Include critical delivery or performance dates, and when you became aware of the requirement.  Provide a specific statement of the impact on Government operations, financial or otherwise, if the required delivery or performance dates are not met. ______ Other   _____________________________________________________ 
Explain:This D7G dozer is used on the Bear Tooth Highway with extreme elevations (10,000+ feet), and sheer cliffs on the roadway.  The potential for an equipment operator accident is greatly elevated if these repairs are not completed. The repair must be performed by the most qualified technicians (the Original Manufacturer is the only facility in our area that is Caterpillar approved to perform these type of repairs). These repairs must be diagnosed and completed within a 1 week period so that roads can open on time and visitors to YNP can travel in a safe manner.  Caterpillar Tractor and Equipment is able to perform this repair within our time restraints (Park Opening Dates set by Park Management).  The D7G dozer is critical to the Snow Crew operations, and without the use of this equipment it will delay the operations thus increasing the potential of not having the highway operational on the opening dates set forth by Park Management. 
3.  Market Research.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest:Due to the technical and critical nature to repair the turning and braking system on a D7G dozer and the terrain it is being used on in YNP, YNP management needs to have these repairs performed by the Original Manufacture repair facility reducing the potential for an accident involving equipment operators and YNP visitors. Caterpillar Tractor and Equipment is the only authorized repair facility within our area that is able to perform the work within our time constraints.  If this equipment is not operational within these time constraints the Government will be harmed due to lost revenues from YNP visitors and YNP will not make their obligations to various Concessionaires within YNP. 
4.  If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:
a.	Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist. b.	The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

<p><br />Category 6 UTP Drop Installation Statement of Work</p>
<p><br />Services:</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor needs to provide a minimum of a 10 year warranty on all parts that are being installed. The contractor shall have a service location site within a 50 mile radius of NMCP to be able to respond on-site within 2 hours of an initial service call if warranty work is required. Contractor will provide all labor and materials to install, test, and terminate the required amount of (according to the 4270 purchasing document) blue plenum rated twisted 4 pair, UTP, 100 Ohm, 24 AWG, 500 MHz (minimum) category 6 communication drops to be used for data communication. All cables will be run in the existing cable trays except as specifically exempted in writing by the NMCP COTR before installation. Contractor will make use of the interstitial, existing junction boxes (must properly drilled and sleeved so box can be closed and secured after installation), conduits and adding to the current data jacks if possible. The cable backbone will be secured to the building structure every ten feet with proper fasteners if there are no existing cable trays or conduit. No cable run will be longer than 90 meters or 295 feet to allow placement of patch cables and still meet the maximum CAT6 limit of 95 meters or 327 feet. This includes an 18 inch concealed courtesy loop at the user end and 10 foot service loop at the closet end. Cables shall not bend beyond the radius specified by the manufacturer and should not bend beyond the Commercial Building Telecommunications Cabling Standard (TIA/EIA-568-B.1 Chap 10.2.1, and TIA/EIA B.1-1 Addendum 1). All cable, when penetrating a firewall, will be sleeved and sealed with fire stopping and will not exceed the 80% fill rate in accordance with the National Electric Code (NEC). UTP cable jacketing will be stripped IAW ANSI /TIA/EIA 568B standards. In addition, the cabling will be run IAW ANSI/TIA/EIA standards to ensure cabling is not run over top of lighting or violating any other set standards. Drops will be installed as home runs from the user wall plate to the communication closet. All drops will be terminated at the user end with blue RJ-45 angled modular jacks (Panduit, Leviton or Ortronics when required). The outlets will be in flush or surface mounted boxes with single, dual, triple or quad face plates. Surface mounted boxes will only be used when flush mounted jacks are not feasible (this will need to be approved by Networking and Facilities at NMCP). Drops are to be installed only where existing electrical outlets exist within 6 feet, but not less than 3 feet, do not cross doorways, and will not cohabitate with electrical runs in modular furniture or conduits leading from the overhead. Data cables will be punched down on a government provided category 6 patch panel (with blue modular jacks) if present or a contractor provided patch panel (a modular Panduit or Leviton with blue Cat6 jacks) if required in the 4270. All category 6 cables will be 100% tested to TIA/EIA standards upon completion of installation. Drops will be labeled in accordance with site labeling standards. All labeling will be machine produced; no handwritten labels are permitted to remain on the cabling. The standard used at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth is communications closet name and drop number. For example 2A01-005, would be a properly labeled drop. All drops will have the room, outlet, and drop number on both ends of each cable. The same labeling will be found on the wall plate as well as the patch panel in the communication closet. When testing the cabling, the drops and the patch panel in the communications closet will be checked for correct labeling and accuracy. Once drops have been completed in any area with both installation and testing, contractor needs to contact the Information Management Department's Network Team (757-953-6389) to have the completed work inspected for accuracy and completion. At least 10% of the drop testing will be observed by a representative from the Network Team. During move, relocation or construction projects all cabling that is disconnected SHOULD NOT be left in the ceiling. Vendor must completely remove the cable from the wall jack to the patch panel and carefully document the drop number that was removed. The removed cabling list will be provided to the Information Management Department's Network Team (757-953-6389). If cabling was removed through a firewall, all fire stopping must be replaced or filled-in in accordance National Electric Code (NEC).</p>
<p>Deliverables:</p>
<p>Contractor will provide site with complete test documentation as well as a cable running list (Appendix A). The cable running list will include building number, floor number, room number, drop number and drop location. Drop location is explained in Appendix B. If cable removal is applicable, vendor must provide a list of all data drop numbers removed to include room number it was removed from. (Appendix A). Contractor will also provide 2 CAT6 patch cables for each data drop installed. The cable at the patch panel will be 5ft in length and the other will be 15ft in length (the patch cables will be delivered to the Networking Office Bldg. 249 room 127).</p>
<p>**DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE WORK, ALL INTERESTED VENDORS MUST ATTEND A "WALK THROUGH" TO EXAMINE WORK CONDITIONS AND EXISTING EQUIPMENT. BIDS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED FROM CONTRACTORS THAT DO NOT ATTEND THE WALK THROUGH.**</p>

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-50.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Heat Transfer and Alternative Energy Systems (HTAES) Group within the Building Environment Division at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) contribute to the advancement of measurement science needed to achieve net-zero energy, high performance buildings. A key component to achieving net-zero energy is advanced building energy technologies, especially renewable energy sources. Accordingly, a focus area for the HTAES Group is to improve the tools used for measuring and evaluating renewable solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies. A solar cell spectral response measurement system is necessary to allow the HTAES Group to reduce the uncertainty of its current, in-house PV measurement capability and to provide a key building block towards exploring ways to make more accurate and more readily implemented spectral response measurements. Such improvements are needed to allow expanded options for verifying manufacturer ratings and to more fairly compare and evaluate the expanding range of PV products and technologies.</p>
<p>***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>1. Capable of relative spectral responsivity measurements of solar cells from at least 300 nm to at least 1750 nm. The system design must not restrict the option of expanding the capabilities of the system in the future in order to permit absolute measurements.<br />2. For spectral responsivity measurements, the system must be capable of wavelength resolution of 10 nm or better.<br />3. Capable of measuring the overall relative spectral response of a 2 cm x 2 cm silicon crystalline cell with an accuracy of better than &plusmn; 4% in the range of 300 nm - 900 nm and &plusmn; 7% or better in the range of 900 nm - 1750 nm.<br />4. Provide a monochromatic beam with an optical output power of at least 10 microwatts at 600 nm.<br />5. The light source for the monochromator must be a dual source consisting of a 300 W Xenon lamp and a 250 W Quartz Halogen light with motorized switching, so each one can be utilized independently over a different wavelength region. An alternative light source and set up is acceptable so long as its performance and functionality equals or exceeds that obtained from the described two-lamp configuration.<br />6. Provide a light biasing capability that utilizes a 1 kW quartz-halogen light source that can illuminate at least a 15 cm x 15 cm area while achieving a uniformity of &plusmn; 15%.<br />7. The light biasing system must be designed so it can be incrementally expanded in the future so as to allow illumination of areas larger than provided by the original system.<br />8. Must include a &frac14; meter monochromator with 3 gratings and 3 slit assemblies.<br />9. The photocurrent detection electronics must be capable of handling DC currents up to 1.5 Amps while simultaneously singling out the cell's incremental photocurrent created by the monochromatic light source that is chopped or pulsed at a frequency ranging from 10 Hz to 800 Hz.<br />10. The monochromatic light source must have a probing spot size in the test plane that is at least 1 cm in diameter. The projection optics of the system must allow a working distance of at least 25 cm.<br />11. The system must include the option for performing DC monochromatic measurements.<br />12. The system must include a sample mounting station, with a cooling plate and a micrometer X-Y-Z stage that provide up to 2.5 cm movement of mounted samples in each direction. The overall size of the cooling plate must be at least 20 cm x 20 cm. The chiller used to provide the constant temperature fluid for the cooling plate is an optional line item (See below).<br />13. The layout of the system must provide the option of placing any cell contained within a solar module having dimensions of 1.0 m x 0.5 m to the test location within the system.<br />14. The system must be computer-controlled with appropriate software provided by the Contractor.<br />15. All components of the system must be designed to operate using single-phase power that is nominally supplied at 60 Hz at a nominal voltage of 120 V or 240 V.<br />16. The system must provide an output of the measured short circuit current in addition to the relative spectral response value.<br />17. The system must allow easy exporting of the spectral response data into an Excel spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Line Item 0002: Quantity One (1) Day of Installation, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>1. The Contractor shall install the system on-site at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.</p>
<p>Line Item 0003: Quantity One (1) Day of Training, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>1. The Contractor shall provide one (1) day of on-site training for NIST personnel on the operation of the system. Training shall be coordinated to occur immediately after installation is complete.</p>
<p>OPTION LINE ITEMS: The following items are option line items. The Contractor must provide pricing for these items or accept disqualification of their quote. Prices quoted shall be effective for a period of one year from the date of award. Award of option line items is at the sole discretion of the Government in accordance with 52.217-7.<br /><br />Option Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Small Temperature Bath or Chiller, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:<br /><br />1. Must be capable of supplying liquid temperatures that range from 15 to 35&ordm;C.<br /><br />Option Line Item 0002: Quantity One (1) Vacuum Pump, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:<br /><br />1.

<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Purpose: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IAW FAR 15.201(e). This notice is solely for market research and planning purposes and does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid, nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government to its ultimate acquisition approach. No award will be made from this Request For Information (RFI) and the Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice. The purpose of this RFI is to gather information from industry on establishing sustainment and enhancement activities for the Financial Information Resource SysTem (FIRST)/Force Structure Data Management (FSDM) system by gaining knowledge of potentially qualified sources and their size classifications (small business, large business, etc.) The Government considers information on market capabilities, common industry standards, latest technological advances, commercial terms, and conditions, timelines for adaptation and integration, and possible suppliers and sources to be helpful. All feedback and information received may be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for possible future acquisitions. Please do not request a copy of a solicitation because one does not exist.</p>
<p>Request for Information/Questions: The Financial Information Resource SysTem (FIRST)/ Force Structure Data Management (FSDM) is an Air Force Programming system designed to support development of the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and the President's Budget (PB). FIRST/FSDM maintains an inventory of the Air Force's force structure (organizations, weapon systems and flying hours) and enables the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS) to prioritize and program Air Force requirements. It also provides a historical query and analysis capability of 30+ years of Air Force budget data and submissions. It replaces and enhances the legacy Program Data System (PDS).</p>
<p>FIRST/FSDM features a modern system architecture that is hosted on the Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) classified integration framework (IF) utilizing the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet). FIRST/FSDM is web-based, utilizing the Oracle 11i Application Suite. Cognos Business Intelligence is used for "what-if" analysis, ad hoc reporting, and reports generation. FIRST/FSDM maximizes the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products and GCSS-AF Services to deliver a system that provides a sustainable flexible, user-friendly information system.</p>
<p>In order to develop any potential acquisition strategy the following information would be useful:</p>
<p>1. Estimated cost of service<br />2. Estimated transition time to provide the service<br />3. Service delivery options (i.e., provide service to service delivery point and provide service to the user)<br />4. Possible peripheral or allied support required from the government.<br />5.

<p>Purpose: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IAW FAR 15.201(e). This notice is solely for market research and planning purposes and does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid, nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government to its ultimate acquisition approach. No award will be made from this Request For Information (RFI) and the Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice. The purpose of this RFI is to gather information from industry on establishing sustainment and enhancement activities for the Financial Information Resource SysTem (FIRST)/Force Structure Data Management (FSDM) system by gaining knowledge of potentially qualified sources and their size classifications (small business, large business, etc.) The Government considers information on market capabilities, common industry standards, latest technological advances, commercial terms, and conditions, timelines for adaptation and integration, and possible suppliers and sources to be helpful. All feedback and information received may be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for possible future acquisitions. Please do not request a copy of a solicitation because one does not exist.</p>
<p>Request for Information/Questions: The Financial Information Resource SysTem (FIRST)/ Force Structure Data Management (FSDM) is an Air Force Programming system designed to support development of the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) and the President's Budget (PB). FIRST/FSDM maintains an inventory of the Air Force's force structure (organizations, weapon systems and flying hours) and enables the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS) to prioritize and program Air Force requirements. It also provides a historical query and analysis capability of 30+ years of Air Force budget data and submissions. It replaces and enhances the legacy Program Data System (PDS).</p>
<p>FIRST/FSDM features a modern system architecture that is hosted on the Global Combat Support System - Air Force (GCSS-AF) classified integration framework (IF) utilizing the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet). FIRST/FSDM is web-based, utilizing the Oracle 11i Application Suite. Cognos Business Intelligence is used for "what-if" analysis, ad hoc reporting, and reports generation. FIRST/FSDM maximizes the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products and GCSS-AF Services to deliver a system that provides a sustainable flexible, user-friendly information system.</p>
<p>In order to develop any potential acquisition strategy the following information would be useful:</p>
<p>1. Estimated cost of service<br />2. Estimated transition time to provide the service<br />3. Service delivery options (i.e., provide service to service delivery point and provide service to the user)<br />4. Possible peripheral or allied support required from the government.<br />5. What performance metrics could be made available to the government related to usage?<br />6. Any other aspects that should be considered by the government as it refines the requirement and potentially develops an acquisition strategy?<br />7. Any inputs concerning the NAICS and SBA size standards that should be considered for any potential RFP?<br />If additional information is required to formulate your response to this RFI, request the information through the POC listed below. A site survey cannot be accomodated at this time. <br /><br />Responses: This RFI is prepared for planning purposes only and is not restricted to small business. If the government decides to pursue an RFP, portions of your RFI response may be incorporated into the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Sources are discouraged from submitting any information deemed competition-sensitive or proprietary. However, if sources elect to submit competition-sensitive or proprietary information, sources bear sole responsibility for marking said information as such to ensure appropriate safeguarding by the Government. The Government shall not be held liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properly identified. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>
<p>1) RFI responses must include company name, address, at least one designated point of contact, voice, and fax telephone numbers, and an email address.<br /><br />2) Please include your Business Type, i.e., Small, Small disadvantaged, Women-owned, Hub Zone, Service-disabled veteran-owned, 8(a), large business, and etc.<br /><br />3) All responses shall be provided on white paper outlining the company's responses, not to exceed 7 pages, single-spaced, Times New Roman, 12 font.</p>

The United States Government (USG) will evaluate offerors' proposals using a four phased Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) approach in accordance with FAR 15.101.2. Offerors will be required to submit separate proposals for each Ignition Cartridge Group they wish to be considered for. The Groups are as follows:<br>Group 1 <br>60mm - M702 <br><br>Group 2<br>81mm - M299<br><br>Group 3<br>81mm - M752A1<br><br>The three phases will consist of the following:<br><br>Phase I-Hazard Classifications <br>Phase II-Manufacturing Readiness Assessment <br>Phase III- Price Evaluation<br><br>In Phases I-II, offerors will be given a rating of either acceptable or unacceptable based on evaluation criteria outlined in the forthcoming solicitation.

Those proposals found acceptance in Phase II, will have their prices evaluated in Phase III. Any offeror determined unacceptable in any phase (I-II) will not continue to have their proposal evaluated in the next phase.<br><br>The USG intends to award two or more basic IDIQ contracts. Those awards will be made to the offerors that are found to be technically acceptable and provide the lowest prices. Prices will be listed in ascending order from lowest to highest and award will be made to those offeror(s) from low to high. <br><br>Offeror(s) receiving an award will be awarded a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract covering a five year period from date of award.

The USG reserves the right to substitute actual HE Mortar Cartridge quantities as the guaranteed minimum if at time of award requirements are available. These quantities, if awarded, will be in lieu of the 20 inert cartridge guaranteed minimum.

<DESC>This synopsis is notification of the Fort Sill Contracting Office's intent to award an interim bridge contract to extend the services of the current Joint Operational Fires and Effects Course (JOFEC) contract, for a period of performance beginning 10 July 2011 - 9 September 2011.  A competitive task order was awarded to Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems, 100 Sun Ave NE, Ste 300, Albuquerque, NM  87109-4660. The interim contract will be performed under the same terms and conditions of the existing contract, DABK01-03-D-0008-1L03, which was competitively awarded at MICC Center-Fort Eustis, Virginia, and will expire on 9 July 2011. This will be an unrestricted sole source procurement. The bridge contract will be issued to the current contractor, Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems, 100 Sun Ave NE, Ste 300, Albuquerque, NM  87109-4660.  The contract type is a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.  This bridge contract will provide critical services to the USAFCOEFS .  This action is accomplished under authority cited in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy agency requirements.  This requirement requires mandatory instructor certifications to be held prior to teaching this course.  Certifications normally take up to 90 days to obtain for the JOFE Course.  Due to time constraints there is not enough time to provide Fair Opportunity to the FCoE contractors per guidance in following the task order competitive procedures which would allow a new contractor a phase-in period for non-certified instructors to obtain certification.  Award to any other source would result in a lapse in service which would result in mission failure. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and is posted for five (5) calendar days.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of this two month period would be advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be issued without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this contract is based on this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code remains 611430.   Any comments or questions to this notice, or detailed capabilities must be emailed to Deidra Zerzavy:  deidra.zerzavy@us.army.mil or Karen Warner:  karen.l.warner@us.army.mil, at the Mission Installation Contracting Command, Fort Sill Contracting Office.<br><br><br>THIS REPOST CORRECTED THE PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES. SERVICES WILL BE FOR TWO MONTHS. ORIGINAL POSTING STATED SIX MONTHS IN ERROR. <br>

The requirements are more fully described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).  In order to determine which vendors have the required capabilities and expertise for the SOW requirements, the FAA requires interested Vendors to explain and describe their capabilities and recent past experience in performing in ALL functional areas listed in the attached OES SOW in their response.  The response should pertain only to contracts of a similar size and complexity as that represented per the draft statement of work provided with this announcement.  For purposes of this assessment, be advised that the estimated value of this procurement is $41M for a period of 5 years.   
This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.3.11.  Interested parties are advised that:
 This is not a SIR or Request for Proposals; The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals; The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred  in preparing the response to the market survey; and Any costs associated with the market survey response submittals are solely at the interested party's expense.
Details of this announcement are listed below:
1.  PurposeThe purpose of this Market Survey is to: (1) Ascertain industry capability and capacity levels for both small and large businesses relative to the functional areas cited, and to improve the Government understanding of the current marketplace to identify qualified and capable sources to perform the services described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).  (2) Survey the marketplace to assess the level of interest among qualified service providers (small or large businesses) of the required services.
2. Description of the Required ServicesThe FAA ATO Finance Services Office of Enterprise Solutions Group's primary objective is to select and implement resource management efficiencies via performance-based business solutions and targeted acquisitions.  This is accomplished through studies and analyses of resources, systems, policies, procedures, technical operations, and organizational structure.  This, in turn, leads to more comprehensive acquisition planning, resource planning, and business process re-engineering.
The contractor will provide a broad range of support services relating to Staffing Standards and Schedule Optimization Analysis, Resource Planning and Analysis, Financial Analysis, Business Process Re-engineering (BPR), Acquisition Planning, Implementation and Transition, Performance Metric Development and Monitoring, Strategic Planning and Policy Development. The requirements are more fully described in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).  
3.  NAICS CodeThe North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for these requirements is 541611 Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services with a size standard of $7 Million. 
4.  Responses to the Market SurveyInterested parties should submit the following information in response to this Market Survey by May 23, 2011.
(a) A one-page letter of transmittal. (b) A statement of capabilities and past experience not to exceed eight pages (12 point Times New Roman font or similar with 1 inch margins or greater) that address your company's capabilities and past experience for each of the following nine functional areas:  
-  Contract Management-  Staffing Standards and Schedule Optimization Analysis, -  Resource Planning and Analysis, -  Financial Analysis, -  Business Process Re-engineering (BPR), -  Acquisition Planning, -  Implementation and Transition, -  Performance Metric Development and Monitoring, -  Strategic Planning and Policy Development 
Your response should address each of the nine functional areas in the same order as shown above and should address both your capabilities and capacity.  Capacity should be addressed in terms of the size of your company (FTEs and revenue) as well as in the specific past experiences (previous contracts) described in the response for each functional area.  For any of the nine functional areas where your company has no capability, capacity and/or past experience the response should clearly identify this lack of capability, capacity and/or past experience.  
The response should also address:  
 A list of contracts under which your company has provided these types of services in the past 5 years including the name of the contract, client, your company's staffing level on the contract (# of FTEs), contract total price or value, your company's percentage of the total staffing on the contract, and your company's role on the contract (prime or subcontractor).  Number of years your company has been in business. Geographical areas where your company can provide the noted services without charging the government any long distance travel costs.   The government plans for all work to be accomplished in the Washington DC Metropolitan area and does not intend to pay long-distance travel expenses. (c) A completed and signed Business Declaration Form attached to this Market Survey.
For purposes of this market research effort, should a response be vague or unclear with respect to capability, capacity and/or past experience in any of the nine areas, the government will conclude that the responder lacks capability and/or capacity in that specific area to perform these services at the noted anticipated size and level of complexity (as depicted per the draft SOW and estimated value).   
If any of the information submitted is considered to be proprietary or business sensitive, the submitter is responsible for marking it accordingly. 
Please indicate whether or not your firm would like to be included on the List of Interested Parties for this requirement.  The FAA will publish this List of Interested Parties to facilitate the subcontracting process between the potential prime offerors and potential subcontractors.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: 

	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   These supplies and accessories are used in conjunction with other VA owned components and equipment.  Supplies are used in various total hip and knee replacements and orthopedic surgeries.  These specific items are used with Stryker's equipment which ensure compatibility.  Since December 1, 2008, Alliant Healthcare has been the only government authorized distributor of Stryker disposables products.   

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  An intent to sole source this requirement, VA-241-11-RQ-0549, was posted on FBO for 10 days and there were no responses received.  Again, since December 1, 2008, Alliant Healthcare has been the only government authorized distributor of Stryker disposables products.   

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The estimated total cost of this order is $119,801.13.  The contracting officer feels that the anticipated costs are fair and reasonable on the basis that pricing is in line with previous orders and there will be no charge for regular ground shipping.  Also, since December 1, 2008, Alliant Healthcare, who is a SDVOSB, has been the only government authorized distributor of Stryker disposables products.  Establishing a standing order with the vendor, who is the only authorized dealer of Stryker disposable products to the government, will allow the requesting service to order their own supplies, thus relieving the need for repetitive purchase orders to be issued.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  As described in Section VI above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting inquiries from interested parties.  There were no responses received.  Again, since December 1, 2008, Alliant Healthcare, who is a SDVOSB, has been the only government authorized distributor of Stryker disposables products.   

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  Since December 1, 2008, Alliant Healthcare has been the only government authorized distributor of Stryker disposables products.   

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See Section VI above

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  Contracting activity will continue to encourage brand name or equivalent specifications.
