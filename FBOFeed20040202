<DESC>PART I - DEFENSE SCIENCES RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY. SOL: BAA04 -12. POC: Dr. Brett Giroir, DARPA/DSO. FAX:(571) 218-4553. 
WEB: http://www.darpa.mil/baa/. E-MAIL: BAA04-12@darpa.mil. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES, SCOPE AND FUNDING. The mission of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office (DSO) is to identify and pursue the most promising technologies within a broad spectrum of the science and engineering research communities and to develop those technologies into important, radically new military capabilities.  In addition, DSO is looking for research ideas and areas that might lead to new innovations in science and engineering.  To this end, DSO is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development in a variety of enabling technical areas as described below. Proposals may be either basic or applied research.  However, in all cases, proposers should demonstrate that their proposed effort is aimed at high-risk/high-payoff technologies that have the potential for making, in the 5-20 year timeframe, revolutionary rather than incremental improvements to national security, including emerging threats and operational challenges.   Proposals that are not within the topical areas described below may be considered out of scope and not evaluated.  Likewise, proposals that are not research, but rather integration of technologies or systems development will also be considered out of scope and will not be evaluated.  
Multiple awards are anticipated.  The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds.  While there is no specific requirement for cost and duration of the proposed effort, it is recommended that proposers include a Phase I of no more than 18 months in length that addresses the most critical issues on the path to success. This BAA constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No Proposer Information Pamphlet or other additional information will be published, nor will a formal request for proposal, or other solicitation, regarding this research and development be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded. TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS OF INTEREST TO DSO. This section describes the general technical interests of DSO.  Please note that while the topics are organized by traditional disciplines, interdisciplinary proposals are encouraged.  Regardless of the technical area, the ultimate success of a proposal is based on the specific technical idea(s) advanced within these areas and especially the uniqueness of the proposed approach.  Consequently, proposing within one of these topic areas is not sufficient to make a compelling case for funding.  For this reason white papers are strongly suggested before submitting a full proposal. (See below). New Materials, Materials Concepts, Materials Processing and Devices: Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: Demonstrations of multifunctional (structure + function) materials;

Special Focus Areas. From time to time, DARPA will publish addenda to this BAA that will highlight particular areas of interest.  It is highly recommended that potential proposers look periodically for these updates.  Any specific instructions or criteria in a published addendum will take precedence over this BAA in response to that addendum only.  DARPA will not establish a distribution list for automatic distribution of these addenda. Other Technical Areas. Ideas outside of the advertised focus areas will be considered in scope only if the proposers can demonstrate that their ideas have the potential for radical improvement to national security and are within the technical interests of the office.  Proposals that integrate existing technologies or products into systems generally do not fall within the purview of the Defense Sciences Office and are likely to be rejected. WHITE PAPER SUBMISSIONS. Before proposers put together a full proposal it is highly recommended (though not required) that they submit a white paper in response to the BAA.  This white paper should clearly state the uniqueness of the idea presented in the context of existing state of the art in the technical area of interest.  Demonstrating that the proposer has a clear understanding of the state of the art and that their proposed effort will make significant improvements therein is essential for a successful proposal.  The white paper should also describe the proposed approach and explain why it is unique.  Further, the proposer should demonstrate an understanding of the payoff of the technical idea, especially in terms of how it might make a difference to Defense capabilities, even if that payoff is beyond the timeframe of the proposed effort. Key milestones expected in the effort should be described.  Also, a brief discussion of the technical expertise of the proposed principal investigator and other key team members should be provided.  Finally, an estimate of the program costs and duration should be included.  White papers should not be longer than 8 pages; however, shorter white papers that can cover the content above are strongly encouraged. Proposers may recommend a program manager to receive their proposals based on prior discussions and/or information on the DSO web site.  Although the office will make every effort to accommodate this request there is no guarantee that your white paper will be reviewed by the program manager you have selected.  A website http://www.sainc.com/dso0412/ has been set up to facilitate the submission of white papers.  This site will allow the filling in of contact information and the uploading of a white paper document in either Word or PDF format.  It will provide a method by which proposers can track their submissions.  White paper submissions may also be made by attachment to an e-mail sent to BAA04-12 (Word 97 or higher is recommended).  Embedded text and Postscript are also acceptable.  Note: if the website is not used, then the body of the e-mail AND the attachment must include name, mailing address, phone number, and fax number of the proposer.  If this information is not contained in the body, the e-mail will be returned for inclusion of that information.  (If proposers choose not to use e-mail, U.S. mail may be used.  White papers will not be accepted by way of facsimile transmissions.)  Within two weeks of receipt of the white paper, the proposer will be informed of receipt of the white paper, provided a proposal log number and given both a technical and administrative point of contact.  The formal recommendation about whether a formal proposal is recommended (Please note, this recommendation is for the benefit of the proposer and is not a guarantee that the full proposal will be funded) will be made as soon as possible.  However, the exact time for response will depend on a variety of circumstances, including the number of white papers received.  All full proposal submissions will be evaluated regardless of the disposition of the white paper.

Proposals may be submitted and received at any time until the final proposal deadline of 4 PM EST February 2, 2005.  Proposals will be evaluated against the criteria set forth in this solicitation, and an offeror will be notified either that: 1) the proposal has been selected for funding, or 2) the proposal has not been selected for funding.  Proposers may elect to have their proposal withdrawn from consideration at any time during the evaluation process.  If a formal request is not made, DARPA will assume that continued evaluation is desired.  One copy only of proposals that are not selected for funding will be retained for administrative purposes.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement including those that do not strictly adhere to the division of technical and cost sections.  The Government also reserves the right to fund proposals in phases with options for continued work at the end of one or more of the phases.  Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or "Other Transaction," depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between parties, and other factors. The offeror must submit a separate list of all technical data or computer software that will be furnished to the Government with other than unlimited rights (see DFARS Part 227). FORMAT AND CONTENT OF FULL PROPOSAL The descriptions contained in this section are to help proposers ensure that proposals have sufficiently detailed information to be evaluated.  Proposals not conforming to the instructions of this section may not, at the discretion of the Government, be evaluated.    Full proposals generally should consist of two volumes, technical and cost.  A website http://www.sainc.com/dso0412/ has been established to facilitate the submission of full proposals electronically.  This site will allow the filling in of contact information and the uploading of a full proposal created with the requirements listed below and the uploading of a document in either Word or PDF format.  Note:  if the website is not used, please use the U.S. mail system or the BAA e-mail account. If submitting via e-mail, the body of the e-mail AND the attachment must include name, mailing address, phone number, and fax of the proposer.  If this information is not contained in the body, the e-mail will be returned for inclusion of that information. If offerors choose to submit by U.S. Mail, they should submit one (1) original and three (3) copies of the full proposal to the address shown below.  Proposals will not be accepted by way of facsimile transmissions.  Volume 1: Technical. The technical volume is limited to a maximum of 30 pages including all figures, references, tables, charts, cover sheet, and appendices and consists of the following sections: a) Executive Summary (two pages or less); b) Technical section that clearly describes the innovation of the work to be accomplished, specific metrics for the effort, the risks to achieving those metrics and approaches for mitigation of those risks.  All milestones should be clearly delineated, especially those early (first year to 18 months) milestones that are critical to demonstration of the concept or approach.  Supporting rationale for performance enhancements should be included.  The perceived need for this research and the potential impact on the DoD should be described, and a Statement of Work (SOW) that summarizes critical tasks to be accomplished should be presented; c) Time-phased schedule-milestone chart; d) Summary of relevant prior work; e) Brief description of applicable facilities and equipment; f) Short resumes of key individuals.  The level of effort and specific roles and qualifications of key individuals should be included.

Proposers are cautioned not to submit supporting material (articles, CD’s.) as these will not be accepted and will not be used in evaluation of the proposal. Volume 2: Cost. The cost volume shall contain the following: A. Cover sheet to include: (1) BAA number; (2) Technical area; (3) Lead Organization Submitting proposal; (4) Type of business, selected among the following categories: "LARGE BUSINESS," "SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS," "WOMAN OWNED BUSINESS," "SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN OWNED," "OTHER SMALL BUSINESS," "HBCU," "MI," "OTHER EDUCATIONAL,” or "OTHER NONPROFIT"; (5) Contractor’s reference number (if any); (6) Other team members (if applicable) and type of business for each; (7) Proposal title; (8) Technical point of contact to include: salutation, last name, first name, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone, fax (if available), electronic mail (if available); (9) Administrative point of contact to include: salutation, last name, first name, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone, fax (if available), and electronic mail (if available);  (10) Award instrument requested: cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF); cost-contract--no fee; cost sharing contract--no fee; or other type of procurement contract (specify), grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction; (11) Place(s) and period(s) of performance; (12) Total proposed cost separated by basic award and option(s) (if any); (13) Name, address, and telephone number of the offeror’s cognizant Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) administration office (if known); (14) Name, address, and telephone number of the offeror’s cognizant Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) audit office (if known); (15) Date proposal was prepared, (16) DUNS, TIN, CAGE CODE; and (17) All subcontractors proposal backup documentation to include items 1-16 above, as applicable and available. B.  Detailed cost breakdown to include:  (1) total program cost broken down by major cost items (direct labor, subcontracts, materials, travel, other direct costs, overhead charges, etc), and (2) an itemization of major subcontracts (labor, travel, materials and other direct costs) and equipment purchases. Where the effort consists of multiple portions that could reasonably be partitioned for purposes of funding, these should be identified as options with separate cost estimates for each. C.  Supporting cost and pricing information in sufficient detail to substantiate the summary cost estimates in B. above.  Include a description of the method used to estimate costs and supporting documentation.  Note:  “cost or pricing data” as defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 2.101 shall be required if the offeror’s proposal is for a procurement contract award of $550,000 or greater unless the offeror requests an exception from the requirement to submit cost or pricing data.  “Cost or pricing data” are not required if the offeror proposes an award instrument other than a procurement contract (e.g., a grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction).  The requirements for submission of “cost or pricing data” are specified in FAR Subpart 15.403-4 (see http://www.arnet.gov/far). OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION. Teaming and Team Composition. Teaming is encouraged, especially when interdisciplinary approaches to a problem are required. Proposals may include, or be led by, foreign firms and/or personnel provided all export control laws and U.S. national security requirements are adhered to in the conduct of the effort and that the work relating to the foreign firm or personnel is unclassified.  The onus of understanding and complying with export control rests with the proposer, not the Government. Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  
Awards made under this BAA are subject to the provisions of the FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflicts of Interest.  Consequently, all offerors and proposed subcontractors must, therefore, affirm whether they are providing scientific, engineering and technical assistance (SETA), or similar support, to any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract numbers.  Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission. All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined at FAR 9.501, must be disclosed.  The disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict.
Technology Transition. Proposers are strongly encouraged to engage commercial and military end-users and commercial manufacturers from the program inception.  The engagement of these communities also helps ensure that the various technologies being developed will be commercially viable (cost effective, manufacturability, etc.) and available to the military.  Thus, proposals are strongly encouraged to include/involve the user-community that intends to bring the technology to practice as a result of this research.  This relationship encourages the participation of researchers, end-users and manufacturers as collective contributors to the technology definition, implementation, and performance evaluation. Proprietary Information. All proprietary information should be marked on both the white paper and the full proposal.  It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation.  Standard proprietary disclaimers notwithstanding, proposals may be reviewed by non-Government technical experts who have signed a non-disclosure agreement with DARPA, unless the specific phrase “TO BE REVIEWED BY GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ONLY” appears on the cover sheet.  In any case, personnel under exclusive contract with DARPA who have completed the appropriate nondisclosure agreements will handle the proposals for administrative purposes. 
EVALUATION CRITERIA. The following evaluation criteria are listed in order of decreasing importance.  Proposals that are considered less than satisfactory in Scientific and Technical Merit will not be evaluated further. Scientific and Technical Merit
Proposers must demonstrate that their proposal is innovative and unique, that the technical approach is sound, that they have an understanding of critical technical issues and risk and that they have a plan for mitigation of those risks.  A significant improvement in capability or understanding above the state of the art must be demonstrated.  All milestones must be clearly and quantitatively described.
Value to Defense. Proposers must demonstrate the potential of successful research to radically change military capability or improve national security with a clear statement of the goals of their program and a quantitative comparison with existing technology.
Capability of the Personnel and Facilities to Perform the Proposed Effort
Proposers must demonstrate that their team has the necessary background and experience to perform this project.  The balance of the technical capabilities of the team must match that required in the program plan.  The relevant experience of key personnel must be sufficient to provide confidence that the proposers can accomplish their objectives.  Proposers must demonstrate that the combined facilities of the team are sufficient to accomplish the objectives of the proposal. Cost Realism. Costs of the proposal must be reasonable and provide a high value to the Government.  ADMINISTRATION. Address for Submission of Unclassified White Papers or Full Proposals: DARPA/DSO, ATTN: BAA04-12, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714. Web address for White Paper Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0412/. Web address for Full Proposal Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0412/. Guidance for Classified Information and Data. The Government anticipates that proposals submitted under a BAA will be unclassified.  In the event that a proposer chooses to submit a classified proposal, the following information is applicable. Security Classification guidance on DD Form 254 will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only.  After reviewing the incoming proposals, if a determination is made that the award instrument may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued and attached as part of the award.  Proposers choosing to submit a classified proposal must first receive permission from the Original Classification Authority to use their information in applying to this BAA.  An applicable classification guide should be submitted to ensure that the proposal is protected appropriately. For Instructions on Submitting Classified White Papers or Full Proposals Contact: Nancy Kassner, Director, Security & Intelligence Directorate (703) 696-2385. All Other Correspondence: Fax:  (571) 218-4553 (Addressed to: DARPA/DSO, BAA04-12), Electronic Mail: BAA04-12@darpa.mil.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC plans to issue Call Order No. NND04AB12D under Minarik Corporation BPA No. E05652D for customized "Electrical Control Modules (ECM’s)."  These modules are based upon the approved “Proto-type Modules” previously procured under the BPA.  This requirement is for manufacture of the customized production units.  The ECM’s are to be utilized for the operation and control of the existing Central Hydraulic System. NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the ECM’s directly from Minarik Corporation, Orange, CA under the terms and conditions of BPA No. E05652D.  The authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  Justification is based upon the fact that all initial design work and other non-recurring costs for the pre-production proto-type units have already been incurred; and that these incurred costs would not be recovered through competition.  Additionally, redesigning and revalidating a different ECM will result in additional costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirements The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 12, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>NASA has new direction to retire the Space Shuttle following completion of the assembly of the International Space Station (ISS) at the end of the decade.  Further, as a consequence of the Columbia accident and the planned Shuttle flight rate of only five flights per year, NASA seeks to augment the Shuttle to enable increased capability to transport cargo to and from the ISS beginning after U.S. core complete in 2006.  NASA continues to refine its space access requirements to support the ISS.  However, during the period 2006-2010 there is more projected demand to return cargo from the ISS than can be supported by the Shuttle.  There is no current or planned capability other than the Shuttle to return cargo from the ISS, with the exception of the very limited capability of the Soyuz.	Accordingly, NASA has a requirement for data to demonstrate the ability of commercial launch systems to support ISS with up-and down-mass capability as soon as practical.  To meet the schedule directed by the President for this new direction, NASA needs these data by the end of CY 2006.  NASA also has an objective to obtain data on technologies needed to support enhanced reliability and vehicle health monitoring of existing launch systems to support the President’s new space exploration directive. In order to fulfill these space transportation objectives, NASA has a requirement to obtain data related to the following: demonstration of technologies that will improve launch system reliability and safety to a level that enables their use to launch astronauts into low Earth orbit and demonstration of the capability of a recoverable launch system to autonomously approach and connect to another platform in space.  In addition, the innovative new modular architectural approaches under consideration by NASA to accomplish exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit will require launch systems with autonomous rendezvous and proximity operations (ARPO) capability to enable the modules to stage and service themselves in low Earth orbit prior to embarking on deep space missions.  NASA needs flight data demonstrating ARPO technology.  A progressive series of flight demonstrations as soon as practical is necessary to enable NASA to verify the repeatability and operability of these technologies in order to provide “lessons learned” for launch system architectures under development. NASA intends to acquire data pertaining to these technologies and capabilities by exercising existing options and adding work to Contract NAS8-01103.  Contract NAS8-01103 was awarded to Kistler Aerospace Corporation in May 2001 as a fixed-price contract under a competitive research announcement.	Kistler is developing the K-1 launch system, which is expected to achieve a first flight within approximately 18 months of authority to proceed with the modified contract.  The K-1 launch system will have a payload capability of approximately 7,000 pounds up-mass and 2,000 pounds down-mass to the ISS. Authority to proceed with work under this contract modification will be contingent on a successful conclusion of the contractor’s Chapter 11 proceedings that results in Kistler having sufficient additional private funding to complete the K-1 development.  NASA funding will not be provided for development of the K-1 launch system.  Payment of NASA funding will be made only upon timely delivery and Government acceptance of the data required under the contract. This contract modification is for a continuation of data acquisition.  The K-1 launch system design includes a number of embedded technologies that will directly benefit launch system development, including an integrated vehicle health management system, advanced checkout and control systems, and a fully autonomous guidance, navigation and control system.  All data pertaining to thirteen specified technologies embedded in the Kistler launch system and the ARPO technology experiments required to accomplish the objectives stated above will be furnished to NASA with unlimited data rights, enabling NASA to make this data available to other contractors to support future NASA space launch solicitations.  This contract will not be used to acquire launch services.  Any procurement of launch services will be the subject of a future competitive solicitation. The current contract contains options to acquire data pertaining to the specified embedded technologies and an ARPO experiment.  NASA will exercise these options, and will add four additional ARPO experiments to the contract, thus acquiring data from a total of 5 flights of the K-1 launch system.  The series of flights, including a progressively more complex series of ARPO experiments, will provide the data necessary to adequately demonstrate these new technologies.  In addition, the series of ARPO experiments should be adequate to demonstrate the capability of a commercial provider to support the ISS with cargo re-supply and return services.  Continued NASA payments for data from each sequential flight will be subject to the successful performance of the preceding flight, in accordance with schedule milestones, and may be terminated by NASA in the event contractor performance is not successful or does not meet the scheduled milestones. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the data from Kistler Aerospace Corporation, located in Kirkland, WA, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2).  The statement of the reason justifying lack of competition is as follows:  NASA determined there are no other identifiable sources that could provide the same data by CY 2006 with no NASA funding for development costs.  This determination is based upon NASA's extensive knowledge of the launch vehicle market and is supported by the detailed launch vehicle market survey conducted by the FAA Office of Commercial Space Transportation and documented in a report titled “2003 U.S. Commercial Space Transportation Developments and Concepts:  Vehicles, Technologies, and Spaceports” dated January 2003.  No other commercially developed launch system with ARPO capability is known to exist or be planned for flight in the timeframe required.  Because a significant portion of the Kistler launch vehicle has been fabricated and an inventory of flight engines has been acquired, Kistler Aerospace Corporation is the only known identifiable path to achieving these objectives as early as 2006.  Therefore, research shows that the data to be delivered by the modification is not available from any other source. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 17, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  Please provide responses in writing to Jackie Byrnes at jackie.byrnes@nasa.gov or NASA/MSFC, Attn: Jackie Byrnes PS50, Marshall Space Flight Center, AL 35812.	All responsible sources may submit written responses, which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
ON RESPONSIVE SPACE OPERATIONS
(AS OF 30 JANUARY 2004)

The National Security Space Architect (NSSA) is gathering information regarding responsive space operations.  For the purpose of this RFI, “responsive space operations” results from the ability of space-based services and products to respond to changes in needs, events, technologies, or other circumstances in a timely manner.  NSSA is currently considering three general timeliness regimes:
1) Long-term responsiveness requiring the conceptualization, design, development, and deployment of new capabilities;
2) Mid-term responsiveness requiring the replenishment, reinforcement, replacement, repair, or modification of existing capabilities; and
3) Short-term responsiveness through the use of novel techniques or operational concepts to exploit latent capabilities.
The information will be used to assist NSSA in developing architectures proposed for use in 2025.  
The NSSA is responsible for developing architectures across the range of National Security space mission areas.  The architectural process integrates future needs and a broad spectrum of future military, civil, and commercial capabilities into candidate architectures; conducts independent analyses to assess the merits of each architecture; and presents recommendations and an investment strategy to the Undersecretary of the Air Force for Space/Director, National Reconnaissance Office and the National Security Space Senior Steering Group consisting of:
- Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration (ASD/NII);
- Deputy Director of Central Intelligence for Community Management (DDCI/CM); and
- Director, Force Structure, Resources, and Assessment Directorate (J8), Joint Staff
This RFI seeks information which will help the NSSA assess responsive space operations capabilities employed, planned, or proposed by national security, civil, and commercial organizations.  Of particular interest are innovative practices, concepts, standards, technologies, non-material applications, and associated commercial architectures.  Specific questions are:
1) How would you characterize your customers’ needs for responsiveness?
2) How would you characterize your responsiveness to customers in these timeframes:
a. Long-term acquisition of capabilities
b. Modification of existing capabilities
c. Exploiting latent portions of existing capabilities
3) What is your overall approach to changing your own capabilities in response to changes in customer needs, new technologies, or other elements of the environment?
4) How are you planning to improve your responsiveness in these areas?
a. Space-based capabilities
b. Terrestrial capabilities
c. Non-material aspects including policies, procedures, and operations concepts
5) What standards are you considering developing, establishing or implementing to support long-term, mid-term, and short-term responsiveness?
6) What technologies do you plan to use to achieve, maintain, or improve long-term, mid-term, and short-term responsiveness?
7) What technologies do you consider high payoff for future responsive space operations capabilities, including those without current space funding support or government sponsorship?
8) To what extent should autonomy or automation be implemented in ground and space systems to support responsiveness?
9) Which commercial capabilities do you believe could be used to enhance the responsiveness of government space capabilities?
10) What type of capabilities do you anticipate using to support the responsiveness of your space-based capabilities proposed for use in 2025.
11) What international cooperation do you intend to be in place in 2025 to achieve better space responsiveness?
12) What interrelationship do you plan or desire to have with the government in 2025 from a responsive space operations perspective?
13) What interest do you have in providing selected services for responsive government space operations?
14) What interest do you have in providing a full range of responsive space operations services to the government?
15) What analytical tools or simulations would you recommend for assessing the performance, cost, and utility associated with responsive space operations?
Answers should describe current responsive space capabilities of space operations, anticipated changes in future levels of responsiveness, and recommendations for architectural options for achieving space operations that are responsive in the long-term, mid-term, and short-term by 2025.
Request contractors interested and capable of performing these functions submit the following information:
1) A capability package, limited to 20 pages or less, that includes:  
a. Contractor information to include, but not be limited to, the Contractor’s name, address, point of contact, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541511   NAICS CODE: 541511 THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6 AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The associated North Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541511 and the business size standard is $21.0 million.  Full and open competitive procedures will be unutilized.  A firm, fixed price purchase order using  Simplified Acquisition Procedures is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for ME Receptor Model Development. STATEMENT OF WORK: BACKGROUND The Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor model is a multivariate receptor model that uses both measured  concentrations and uncertainty estimates to generate both particulate matter (PM) source profiles and source contribution estimates. The PMF receptor model uses a least squares approach to perform the factor analysis and incorporates non-negativity constraints (Paatero, 1997).  The PMF receptor  model is implemented as either PMF2 or PMF3 based on the structure of the data with PMF2 used for a single sampling site, and PMF3 used for multiple sampling sites.  The Multilinear Engine (ME) receptor model was also developed by Paatero (1999), which uses a more flexible algorithm and a script  language similar to Fortran or C.  PMF can be implemented through ME, and ME allows for the incorporation of source profile constraints and the use of supplementary variables such as weekday/weekend and wind direction (Paatero, 2002).  The ability to incorporate additional supplementary information  and the flexibility of the ME program has allowed it to be used for the evaluation of both ambient and personal exposure data (Hopke et al., 2003). Standardized pre- and post- processing procedures do not exist for the ME or PMF receptor models.  In addition, the ME model does not calculate  uncertainties.  Lastly, there are few measures of goodness of fit of the model to the data.  The lack of standardized pre- and post- processing diagnostics, calculated uncertainty estimates, and indicators of how well the model fits the data limits the use of this powerful model for receptor  modeling by State and Local Air Pollution Agencies to support State Implementation Plans for Particulate Matter. SCOPE The contractor shall develop a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) for the ME model development.  The contractor shall develop a document describing recommended data  pre-processing and diagnostics for the ME receptor model.  The contractor shall provide a stand-alone executable of PMF2 implemented through the ME receptor modeling program described in Paatero et al. 1999, which can be distributed by EPA at no charge to the user.  This version of the program will  be registered to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  The executable shall allow transfer of sampling concentration, sample uncertainty, and supplementary data (factors such as weekend/weekday) to the program and will output model diagnostics, source profiles, sample source contribution  estimates, and factor coefficients.  In addition, the contractor shall develop algorithms to estimate the uncertainty of the source profiles, sample source contribution estimates, and factor coefficients.  The contractor shall prepare a document that describes the method used to calculate the  uncertainties.  The contractor shall add the uncertainty algorithm to the executable. As an optional task, the contractor shall develop advanced model diagnostics that indicate how well the data meets the assumptions underlying the ME receptor model and develop summary information that indicates  how well the specified ME model fits the data.  The intentions of such diagnostics and summary statistics is to ease the comparison of one ME solution to another, to aide the user in identifying poor solutions, and to aide the user in improving the model and hence the solution.  Possible  diagnostics include correlation coefficients between observed and predicted data, patterns in the correlations such as poor correlation during certain time periods, cross-validation errors, influence of non-representative observations, indicators of variables or time steps for which there is so  little signal in the data that the variable or observation should be removed from the modeling, indicators of amount of rotational ambiguity in a solution, and information about how different the source profiles can be due to the rotational ambiguity. TASKS TO BE COMPLETED Task 1.  Provide a  Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) for the ME model development. The contractor shall provide to the EPA a report describing the ME model development quality assurance procedures (see Guidance for Quality Assurance Project Plans for Modeling EPA QA/G-5M, EPA/240/R-02/007, Dec 2002;  http://www.epa.gov/quality/qs-docs/g5m-final.pdf): a) describe and provide references for theories/techniques/methodologies that will be used. b) assess whether available algorithms, and other information to be used in Tasks 2 - 4 are adequate and sufficiently complete to develop the pre- and post  processing diagnostics and algorithms, ME executable, and ME uncertainty estimates. c) define the criteria for assessing the quality and reliability of the algorithms and of the model that is being developed and applied (availability and results of quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) data,  etc.); d) report the results from the information quality and reliability assessments, and; e) assess and ensure that the model, and model results are accurate and complete, including a QA evaluation of the process and products. Task 2: ME Pre- and Post-Processing The contractor shall create a  document consisting of recommendations for ME receptor model pre- and post- processing requirements and diagnostics.  The contractor shall create an algorithm using MATLAB to pre-process data for the ME executable.  Similarly, the contractor shall develop algorithms using MATLAB for post-processing  the output data from the ME executable. The contractor shall provide the algorithms to EPA.  The contractor shall provide an example particulate matter data set, pre-processing results, ME output (source profiles, source contributions, and diagnostics), and post-processing diagnostics/figures. Task  3: ME Executable The contractor shall develop a stand-alone version of PMF2 implemented through the ME model described by Paatero (1999).  The contractor shall provide an executable that can input and output selected variables.  The input variables shall at least include total mass (i.e. PM2.5),  species concentrations, species uncertainties, three supplementary variables or factors (weekday/weekend, season, wind direction), and other required model parameters such as the matrix dimensions, number of factors, robust/non-robust, stabilizer, positive/negative outlier distance, and missing  data limit.  The option for use of  0,1, 2, or 3 supplementary variables shall be allowed by the executable.  Output variables shall at least include source profile, sample source contributions, factor coefficient estimates, scaled residuals, and model diagnostics (number of iterations, Q, and  variables required for post processing (Task 2). Task 4: ME Uncertainty Estimates The contractor shall develop algorithms to estimate the uncertainty in the source profiles, individual sample source contribution estimates, factor coefficients, and average source contribution estimates.  The  contractor shall document the algorithms in a format suitable for submission to Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems (15 pages).  The contractor shall add the uncertainty algorithms to the Task 3 executable and provide a revised ME executable.  Output variables in the revised ME  executable shall at least include source profile and uncertainties, sample source contribution and uncertainties, factor coefficient estimates and uncertainties, scaled residuals, and model diagnostics (number of iterations, Q, and variables required for post processing (Task 2)). Optional Task 5:  Advanced Model Diagnostics The contractor shall create a document consisting of recommendations for advanced model diagnostics for the ME receptor model.  The contractor shall develop algorithms using MATLAB for performing these diagnostics and shall provide these algorithms to EPA.  The contractor  shall demonstrate these diagnostics on the example particulate matter data set used in Task 2.  The diagnostics for this task should build on those developed in Task 2.  Additionally, the diagnostics should tie directly into the uncertainty estimates developed in Task 4 in that models with large  uncertainty estimates likely should have model diagnostics indicative of poor model performance whereas models with small uncertainty estimates likely should have diagnostics indicative of a model that is appropriate and fits the data well. DELIVERABLES Task 1.  Provide a Quality Assurance Project  Plan (QAPP) for the ME model development Provide a QAPP (Microsoft Word format)  describing the ME model development quality assurance procedures.   Deliverable date: 45 days after the start of the performance period. Task 2: ME Pre- and Post-Processing Provide document (Microsoft Word format)   describing recommendations for pre- and post-processing requirements for the ME receptor model, and provide the pre-processing and post-processing algorithms (MATLAB m-files). Deliverable date: 3 months after the start of the performance period.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The Air Force Research Laboratory, Contracting Directorate, on behalf of the Space Vehicles Directorate, Spacecraft Technology Division, Spacecraft Component Technology Branch, Kirtland AFB, NM intends to award sole source, follow-on contracts to Boeing Space Systems (BSS) and Northrop Grumman Space Technologies (NGST) for the following described efforts based on technology developed and demonstrated by BSS and NGST under previously awarded open competition.


BACKGROUND: The history of Multi-Access Laser Space Terminal (MALST) is embedded in the Transformational Communications (TC) effort.  TC provides laser communications support for a diverse set of Airborne Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (AISR) platforms such as Global Hawk, U2 and MC2A.  Forecasted user needs project 6 vehicles in each of 2 theaters plus an additional 4 vehicles worldwide.  More current technology provides laser communications using single access heads that can handle one platform at a time.  Studies by contractors and the government have indicated that satisfying these needs with single access terminals involves unacceptable platform weight, power and cost. These factors drive the need for a combined space platform.  MALST is a space based optical laser communication system that can provide simultaneous laser communications with multiple airborne users. The objective of MALST is to achieve the desired capabilities at significantly reduced cost, weight and power, and is thus considered a critical enabling technology for the Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA).


OBJECTIVE: The objective of this proposed contract is to:  Procure risk analysis, risk reduction breadboard development, and system requirements for the MALST program in the pursuant of achieving Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 by FY08.  This effort will also take the program a large step toward eventual brassboard development by FY06 and prototype by FY08.  This contract is a meant to build upon the extensive analysis from the previous PRDA contract in FY03 to Boeing Space Systems and NGST.     

The period of performance for the above effort is 12 months with an anticipated start date of Jan 2004. Contracts will be awarded to Boeing Space Systems and Northrop Grumman Space Technologies (NGST), provided other sources cannot furnish the services at equivalent terms. Respondents are required to provide sufficient information concerning their ability to fulfill the above requirements within the period of performance in order for the project office to determine the requirements can be met. A draft program plan as well as resumes of key personnel must also be included in the response. Responses are limited to a total of 25 pages including program plan, resumes, attachments, diagrams, etc. Submit responses to Maj Jayne Faris, Det 8 PKVE, 2251 Maxwell Avenue SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5773 no later than 15 calendar days after the date of this announcement by 4:00 PM Mountain Daylight Time. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only two sources under authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 day of this notice. Firms responding should indicate if they are a Small Business, a Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business, an 8(a) Certified Business, a Woman-Owned Business and/or a HUBZone Certified Small Business Concern. To be considered a Small Business the following applies: SIC 541710, size standard 1,000 employees. Foreign owned firms are advised to contact the Contracting Officer or Project Manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award. It is anticipated that contractors will have access to or will generate data that is unclassified with limited distribution and/or subject to U.S. Export Control laws.  Therefore, only offerors who are certified by the Defense Logistics Information Services (DLIS) may submit offers.  Contact US/Canada Joint Certification Office, DLIS, Federal Center, 74 Washington Ave, North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3084 (1 (800) 352-3572) http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for further information on certification and the approval process.  The offeror is required to either submit a copy of the DLIS approved DD Form 2345 with its proposal or to the Contracting Officer if access to unclassified, limited distribution data is required to prepare the proposal. It is anticipated that a DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, with a classification level of Top Secret is required during the performance of this effort.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>ADDITIONL QUESTION:

1. I have received Modification #2. It does not adequately answer the
question regarding the sizes of the bag filters. Also important is the make and model of the required filter replacements for both the pleated and bag filters. Could there be problems during launchings?

The correct filter sizes are in the scope of work. The depth of the bag filters is around 22 inches.  There will be no problems during launchings.


All terms and conditions of this solicitation remain the same.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>Synopsis is modified as  follows:

This will be an Indefinite Quantity type contract under which work will be required on an “as needed” basis, intermittently, during the life of the contract.  Each Task Order will be firm-fixed price.  The government will determine the task order amount by using negotiated rates and negotiated level of effort required to perform each project.  The life of the contract will be (1) a base and four option periods, with (2) a maximum contract limitation of $5,000,000 or whichever occurs first.  Typically, an option is a 12-month period; therefore, each option period may be exercised for twelve (12) months, but only to the extent of the maximum contract limitation of $5,000,000.  There will be no future synopsis in the event the options, included in the contract, are exercised.  Proposals may be subject to an advisory audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.

NOTE: The previously requested Qualification Statement from prospective offerors, is no longer a requirement.  All information to qualify the prospective offeror should be addressed in their proposal in response to the solicitation.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541511   NAICS CODE: 541511 THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6 AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The associated North Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541511 and the business size standard is $21.0 million.  Full and open competitive procedures will be unutilized.  A firm, fixed price purchase order using  Simplified Acquisition Procedures is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for ME Receptor Model Development. STATEMENT OF WORK: BACKGROUND The Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor model is a multivariate receptor model that uses both measured  concentrations and uncertainty estimates to generate both particulate matter (PM) source profiles and source contribution estimates. The PMF receptor model uses a least squares approach to perform the factor analysis and incorporates non-negativity constraints (Paatero, 1997).  The PMF receptor  model is implemented as either PMF2 or PMF3 based on the structure of the data with PMF2 used for a single sampling site, and PMF3 used for multiple sampling sites.  The Multilinear Engine (ME) receptor model was also developed by Paatero (1999), which uses a more flexible algorithm and a script  language similar to Fortran or C.  PMF can be implemented through ME, and ME allows for the incorporation of source profile constraints and the use of supplementary variables such as weekday/weekend and wind direction (Paatero, 2002).  The ability to incorporate additional supplementary information  and the flexibility of the ME program has allowed it to be used for the evaluation of both ambient and personal exposure data (Hopke et al., 2003). Standardized pre- and post- processing procedures do not exist for the ME or PMF receptor models.  In addition, the ME model does not calculate  uncertainties.  Lastly, there are few measures of goodness of fit of the model to the data.  The lack of standardized pre- and post- processing diagnostics, calculated uncertainty estimates, and indicators of how well the model fits the data limits the use of this powerful model for receptor  modeling by State and Local Air Pollution Agencies to support State Implementation Plans for Particulate Matter. SCOPE The contractor shall develop a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) for the ME model development.  The contractor shall develop a document describing recommended data  pre-processing and diagnostics for the ME receptor model.  The contractor shall provide a stand-alone executable of PMF2 implemented through the ME receptor modeling program described in Paatero et al. 1999, which can be distributed by EPA at no charge to the user.  This version of the program will  be registered to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  The executable shall allow transfer of sampling concentration, sample uncertainty, and supplementary data (factors such as weekend/weekday) to the program and will output model diagnostics, source profiles, sample source contribution  estimates, and factor coefficients.  In addition, the contractor shall develop algorithms to estimate the uncertainty of the source profiles, sample source contribution estimates, and factor coefficients.  The contractor shall prepare a document that describes the method used to calculate the  uncertainties.  The contractor shall add the uncertainty algorithm to the executable. As an optional task, the contractor shall develop advanced model diagnostics that indicate how well the data meets the assumptions underlying the ME receptor model and develop summary information that indicates  how well the specified ME model fits the data.  The intentions of such diagnostics and summary statistics is to ease the comparison of one ME solution to another, to aide the user in identifying poor solutions, and to aide the user in improving the model and hence the solution.  Possible  diagnostics include correlation coefficients between observed and predicted data, patterns in the correlations such as poor correlation during certain time periods, cross-validation errors, influence of non-representative observations, indicators of variables or time steps for which there is so  little signal in the data that the variable or observation should be removed from the modeling, indicators of amount of rotational ambiguity in a solution, and information about how different the source profiles can be due to the rotational ambiguity. TASKS TO BE COMPLETED Task 1.  Provide a  Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) for the ME model development. The contractor shall provide to the EPA a report describing the ME model development quality assurance procedures (see Guidance for Quality Assurance Project Plans for Modeling EPA QA/G-5M, EPA/240/R-02/007, Dec 2002;  http://www.epa.gov/quality/qs-docs/g5m-final.pdf): a) describe and provide references for theories/techniques/methodologies that will be used. b) assess whether available algorithms, and other information to be used in Tasks 2 - 4 are adequate and sufficiently complete to develop the pre- and post  processing diagnostics and algorithms, ME executable, and ME uncertainty estimates. c) define the criteria for assessing the quality and reliability of the algorithms and of the model that is being developed and applied (availability and results of quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) data,  etc.); d) report the results from the information quality and reliability assessments, and; e) assess and ensure that the model, and model results are accurate and complete, including a QA evaluation of the process and products. Task 2: ME Pre- and Post-Processing The contractor shall create a  document consisting of recommendations for ME receptor model pre- and post- processing requirements and diagnostics.  The contractor shall create an algorithm using MATLAB to pre-process data for the ME executable.  Similarly, the contractor shall develop algorithms using MATLAB for post-processing  the output data from the ME executable. The contractor shall provide the algorithms to EPA.  The contractor shall provide an example particulate matter data set, pre-processing results, ME output (source profiles, source contributions, and diagnostics), and post-processing diagnostics/figures. Task  3: ME Executable The contractor shall develop a stand-alone version of PMF2 implemented through the ME model described by Paatero (1999).  The contractor shall provide an executable that can input and output selected variables.  The input variables shall at least include total mass (i.e. PM2.5),  species concentrations, species uncertainties, three supplementary variables or factors (weekday/weekend, season, wind direction), and other required model parameters such as the matrix dimensions, number of factors, robust/non-robust, stabilizer, positive/negative outlier distance, and missing  data limit.  The option for use of  0,1, 2, or 3 supplementary variables shall be allowed by the executable.  Output variables shall at least include source profile, sample source contributions, factor coefficient estimates, scaled residuals, and model diagnostics (number of iterations, Q, and  variables required for post processing (Task 2). Task 4: ME Uncertainty Estimates The contractor shall develop algorithms to estimate the uncertainty in the source profiles, individual sample source contribution estimates, factor coefficients, and average source contribution estimates.  The  contractor shall document the algorithms in a format suitable for submission to Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems (15 pages).  The contractor shall add the uncertainty algorithms to the Task 3 executable and provide a revised ME executable.  Output variables in the revised ME  executable shall at least include source profile and uncertainties, sample source contribution and uncertainties, factor coefficient estimates and uncertainties, scaled residuals, and model diagnostics (number of iterations, Q, and variables required for post processing (Task 2)). Optional Task 5:  Advanced Model Diagnostics The contractor shall create a document consisting of recommendations for advanced model diagnostics for the ME receptor model.  The contractor shall develop algorithms using MATLAB for performing these diagnostics and shall provide these algorithms to EPA.  The contractor  shall demonstrate these diagnostics on the example particulate matter data set used in Task 2.  The diagnostics for this task should build on those developed in Task 2.  Additionally, the diagnostics should tie directly into the uncertainty estimates developed in Task 4 in that models with large  uncertainty estimates likely should have model diagnostics indicative of poor model performance whereas models with small uncertainty estimates likely should have diagnostics indicative of a model that is appropriate and fits the data well. DELIVERABLES Task 1.  Provide a Quality Assurance Project  Plan (QAPP) for the ME model development Provide a QAPP (Microsoft Word format)  describing the ME model development quality assurance procedures.   Deliverable date: 45 days after the start of the performance period. Task 2: ME Pre- and Post-Processing Provide document (Microsoft Word format)   describing recommendations for pre- and post-processing requirements for the ME receptor model, and provide the pre-processing and post-processing algorithms (MATLAB m-files). Deliverable date: 3 months after the start of the performance period. Task 3: ME Executable Provide an ME executable and  report (Microsoft Word format) describing the ME executable (inputs, outputs, and diagnostics) based on an example data set. Deliverable date: 6 months after the start of the performance period. Task 4: ME Uncertainty Estimates Provide document (Microsoft Word format) describing uncertainty  algorithms.  Add the uncertainty algorithms to the Task 3 executable and provide the executable.  Deliverable date: 12 months after the start of the performance period. Optional Task 5: Advanced Model Diagnostics Provide document (Microsoft Word format) describing recommendations for advanced model  diagnostics for the ME receptor model and provide MATLAB algorithms as m-files that implement the diagnostics.

The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service (NWS) intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with Gravitec Systems, Inc., Bainbridge Island, WA to acquire fall protection and rescue training courses for new climbers and to re-certify current employees.  Specifically, the Government requires the  courses to be conducted in order to meet the following objectives:  A 2.5 day course of initial general rescue techniques for personnel required to climb structures less than 100 feet high; A 2.5 day re-certification instructional course that includes general rescue techniques for personnel required to climb structures less than 100 feet high; and A 4-day initial and re-certification course that includes curriculum of the initial 2.5 day course and additional 1.5 day of advanced rescue techniques for personnel required to climb structures 100 feet and higher.

The training must include classroom instructions and sufficient hands-on training that will qualify the "competent person" as defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.  Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government's requirements are invited to submit an affirmative response.  To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit in writing documentation that demonstrates an ability to meet the aforementioned requirements.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  A fixed-price contract is contemplated for this effort.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than February 6, 2004.  A copy of the Statement of Work for this requirement can be found on the Federal Business Opportunity page at the following web site:  http://www.eps.gov.  See Note 22.

<DESC>This modification to the previous pre-solicitation notice is for clarification purposes.  Date and place have not changed.  See Note below. With this announcement, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Special Projects Office (SPO), is providing advance notice of a new Research and Development (R&D) program, Threat Agent Cloud Tactical Intercept and Countermeasure (TACTIC).  I n support of the TACTIC Program, DARPA plans to release two Broad Agency Announcements (BAAs) simultaneously:  BAA04-TDT (TACTIC-DT, Detection Technologies) and BAA04-TCM (TACTIC-CM, Countermeasure).  These efforts will represent the first phase of the TAC TIC Program. The TACTIC Program focuses on interception and defeat of chemical and biological threat agent aerosol/vapor clouds on the battlefield that can be produced during military operations either by defensive measures against an adversary or by intentional agent dissemination/release by an adversary.  Release of such agents could cause widespread disruption of military operations.  The TACTIC Program seeks to actively protect troops and military assets from such events and to provide a means to maintain critical m ilitary operations at the required tempo by pursuing two paths in parallel:  1) development of technologies that can rapidly detect, discriminate and identify chemical and biological airborne clouds with low false-alarm rates, and 2) development of technol ogies that can defeat (precipitate and/or neutralize) the clouds before they can reach the troops on the battlefield.   The actions outlined in this Notice are intended solely to enable potential sources to gain an understanding of the TACTIC Program prior to the release of the associated BAAs.  It is DARPAs intention to release the BAAs, which will be posted on the Federal  Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website, approximately two weeks after this Pre-Solicitation Notice is released.  Proposals will be due approximately 45 days after the release of the BAAs. A Pre-Proposal Conference (Bidders Brief) will be held approximately three weeks after the FedBizOpps BAA releases.  The conference will be held in Virginia, at Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc.  The morning session will be dedicated to discussions of TACTIC-DT an d the afternoon session will be dedicated to TACTIC-CM.  Attendance at this meeting is voluntary and limited to organizations that can demonstrate a reasonable expectation of having expertise that might contribute to the success of the TACTIC Program.  How ever, attendance is not required in order to be deemed eligible to propose on this program.  Instructions for registration, along with all TACTIC Program information will be provided at https://dtsn.darpa.mil/TACTIC following release of the BAAs.  Registra tion will close 3 days prior to the conference. The DARPA TACTIC Program Manager will be available for meetings, telephone conferences, or video telephone conferences to discuss technical approaches from Proposers, during a two week period following the Pre-Proposal Conference.  These can be scheduled b y contacting BAA04-TDT@darpa.mil or BAA04-TCM@darpa.mil. The anticipated scope of work to be covered under the TACTIC Program includes:  development of the detection or countermeasure technology to the specifications outlined in the Proposer Information Pamphlets (PIP) for each respective BAA; a (mathematical) m odel that predicts the probability of detection (PD) and probability of false alarm (PFA) (for the detection technology), and a model that predicts the performance of the countermeasure (e.g., log reduction in live agent); experiments conducted at Performe r laboratories and testbeds; experimental results coupled to modeling to predict performance of the technologies, and; testing conducted at a Government aerosol testing laboratory.   If testing at the Government facility is deemed successful, the Government will initiate a new Phase, to integrate Detection Technologies and Coun termeasures into an operational system.  This Phase will include a new competition for Performers.   The Government will not reimburse attendees for any costs associated with the Pre-Proposal Conference discussed in this announcement.   Questions of a technical nature should be sent to BAA04-TDT@darpa.mil or BAA04-TCM@darpa.mil.  Questions of a contractua l nature should be addressed to:  Ms. Marjorie Roberts, Contract Specialist, marjorie.roberts@us.army.mil.  Contracting Officers Representative (COR), Mr. Peter Annunziato, peter.annunziato@us.army.mil. Note: This system puts in strange characters and spaces where spaces do not belong.

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote E08210 and will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation that will be issued.  A written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-18.  The Food and Drug Administration, Office of the Commissioner, OER-IO intends to award a purchase order to use a public relations firm to develop and implement a plan for using the media to educate and inform FDAs constituents for the 2006 Centennial Commemoration.   Contract line items include the following: Item 1 – Develop a plan for commemorating the FDA centennial through broadcast and other media over a three year time span from 2004-2006 in accordance with SOW paragraph 3.1;  Item 2 - Develop the media project ideas and implementation ideas for constituents in accordance with SOW paragraph 3.2;  Item 3 -Define roles and responsibilities for implementation in accordance with SOW paragraph 3.3;   Item 4 - Use the media to achieve broad constituent recognition of the FDA’s vital role in protecting and promoting the health and safety of the public in accordance with SOW paragraph 3.4.   

1.  Objective
 
On June 30, 2006, the Food and Drug Administration will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 1906 Food and Drugs Act, legislation that established our nation's oldest federal consumer protection agency.  The agency wants to celebrate this historic milestone by promoting activities throughout the nation.  
 
In 2002, the agency contracted with a public relations firm to develop a theme and plan for commemorating FDA's 100th anniversary.  The theme is PROTECTING AND ADVANCING AMERICA’S HEALTH.  FDA envisions the implementation of a national public education program to recognize the scientific advances that have led to the safety and effectiveness of FDA regulated products.  As a result of this effort, the public consciousness of the FDA should be heightened so that both the consumer and policymakers see the agency as a pioneer and leader in the field of health protection and emerging scientific advances as we seek to recruit young scientists. 
 
The objective of this contract is to use a public relations firm to develop and implement, in the next year, a plan to use the media as the channel for educating and informing FDA's constituents over a three-year timeframe culminating with the 2006 centennial commemoration.   
 
2.  Goals
 The goals for the FDA Centennial are as follows:
 
Goal 1     Use broadcast and other media to observe and celebrate FDA's first 100 years of contributions to America's public health and the world community and further FDA's mission to promote and protect the public health for future generations.
 
Goal 2     Use broadcast and other media to commemorate contributions of dedicated FDA employees, legislators, academicians, industry, advocacy groups and public health leaders who have supported the consumer protection mission of the Agency.
 
Goal 3     Use broadcast and other media to broaden public awareness of the considerable breath of the FDA's authorities and programs and instill a fuller appreciation of the Agency's impact on the public health and safety of our Nation.
 
Goal 4     Use broadcast and other media to stimulate interest and increase awareness of FDA regulatory science and public health through education.

 
3.  Specific Tasks

3. 1. Develop a media plan and timetable for commemorating FDA's 100th anniversary of the 1906 
Food and Drugs Act.  The media messages will convey the importance of FDA in consumer's lives and how the FDA plays a role in 25 cents of every dollar consumers spend. 

The plan must be presented in writing. This plan will be reviewed through the FDA Office of External Relations and approved prior to implementation of the tasks specified in the contract.

3. 2. The plan should include specific activities to be carried-out throughout the three-year timetable culminating in the 2006 centennial year.  The plan must include all FDA centers and the Office of Regulatory Affairs (headquarters and field).  For example, a list of inventive elements such as televised town hall meetings, a Smithsonian lecture/exhibit/traveling exhibit, or the development of high school and college curriculum. 
Develop a strategy for extending FDA coverage through the media partnerships that will be mutually beneficial to the news organization and the FDA.  Partnerships may include, but is not limited to, business and industry, academia, consumer organizations, health professional associations, disease oriented advocacy groups, and faith-based and community-based programs.  Examples of activities may include  FDA information in regular programming, periodic special programming with commentary from the Commissioner or other senior FDA officials, and/or weekly specials to highlight FDA issues that affects its constituents, website recognition of FDA's centennial, exhibits at meetings, and development of educational modules for school use.
3.3.  Define the roles and responsibilities and the parts they will play throughout the three-years of celebration for the Commissioner, Center Directors, field staff and FDA Alumni Association members as well as involvement at the Department level and perhaps Cabinet level. 
3.4.   The media plan will need to communicate with all levels of FDAs constituents by translating complex themes to messages that are direct and easily understood.  These messages should speak to consumers about issues that affect their lives and offer strong visual and human interest components using real life examples whenever feasible.  The messages must cover a broad spectrum of constituents such as other governmental and public health entities, national institutions such as the Smithsonian Institute and the National Academy of Sciences, and media such as television (PBS), radio (NPR) and print (newspapers and magazines) to promote the centennial.

<SUBJECT>A--Uncooled B-Kit (UBK) Risk Reduction Demonstration
<SOLNBR>NBCHN040001
<RESPDATE>021304
<ARCHDATE>02012005
<CONTACT>Jane Bourne COR 5205331642     Jane_A_Bourne@nbc.gov;
<DESC>Sources Sought Announcement - Uncooled B-Kit (UBK) Risk Reduction Demonstration The US Army Project Manager Night Vision/Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition (PM NV/RSTA) is contemplating the initiation of a Risk Reduction Program Demonstration for the Uncooled B-Kit (UBK). The Uncooled B-KitUBK does not yet exist.  However, the goal  is an to bring industry and government system developers together to develop an uncooled infrared (IR) thermal imaging module that may be used across many current and developing systems that require uncooled thermal IR imagery.  To this end, PM NV/RSTA is seeking industry participation in completing an UBK specification and Interface Control (ICD) documents. A draft specification and draft ICD has been developed.  These documents describe the .current concept for the module, which   It includes an uncooled IR Focal Plane Array (FPA), optical window, supporting electronics, shutter (optional), and a standard electrical connector.  The Uncooled B-KitUBK does not include a displaydisplay or objective optics.  The Uncooled B-KitUBK will have standard and well-defined electronic and mechanical interfaces to facilitate integration into future, and possibly current, thermal imaging systems such as those used for:  driving tactical and combat vehicles, target acquisition systems for light, medium and heavy individual and crew-served combat weapons, missiles (seekers/sensors), IR search and rescue systems, RSTA payloads for unmanned aerial vehicles, unattended sensors, unmanned ground vehicles, and Future Combat Systems of Systems (FCS) uncooled IR applications.  The goal is that the B-Kit may be used as the "thermal engine" for future system development efforts thereby serving to reduce the system development costs and technical risk as well as providing a substantial reduction in recurring/production costs due to the economies of scale associated with commonality.  The B-Kit may also be integrated (forward fit) directly into existing systems to provide both a performance improvement and reduction in production costs.   Currently, tThere are different three configurations of the Uncooled B-KitUBK envisioned to account for performance requirements that translate into different Focal Plane Array (FPA) formats (sizes).  FPAs of the 25-µm-pixel size shall be considered standard in accordance with the goals of the Uncooled ManTech effort BAA 03-04-FH.   FPA formats (sizes)sizes will span standard pixel counts: 160 x 120, 320 x 240, and 640 x 480.  These are designated U1, U2, U3 respectively.  In order to provide relative sizes in context: U1 may be used in very small systems such as unattended ground sensors (UGS), U2 may be used in future thermal goggles and light weapon thermal sights, U3 may be used in medium and heavy weapon thermal sights, Driver's Vision Enhancer (DVE) and FCS platforms.  A larger, yet undefined array size (U4) may be used in future, larger vehicle applications.  U1, U2 and U3 will have pixel size of 25.2 +/- 0.2 microns.   The Uncooled B-KitUBK Risk Reduction Demonstration will focus on entail the development of a limited number of systems for test, integration and evaluation.  Up to two awards may be madeThe goal is to have at least two awardsdifferent vendors participate in  for this demonstration effort with a start no later than Jun 04.   The current strategy is schedule for award of the Risk Reduction Program is to release an RFP in March 2004 and contract award(s) in June 2004.   In order to facilitate the completion of the specification and ICD development of the best set of technical documentation for the Risk Reduction Program Demonstration, the Government is seeking the participation of industry in a working group session on 18 Feb 2004 at Ft. Belvoir, VA.  The agenda for the working group session will include a briefing on the requirements and schedule of the Risk Reduction Demonstration, an overview of the current status of the Uncooled B-KitUBK Performance Specification and ICD, an open forum discussion, and individual meetings between the Government personnel and each interested company.  A copy of the most recent draft Uncooled B-KitUBK Performance Specification and Interface Control Document (dated 5 Sep 2003) will be made available to interested parties.  Technical point of contact is Mr. Aric Sherwood, aric.sherwood@nvl.army.mil. The working group session will take place at 0900 hrs to 1700 hrs on 18 Feb in the Kelly Conference Room in Bldg 399 of the Night Vision Compound at Ft. Belvoir, VA.   Please send a list of individuals who will be attending to Ms. Jessica Dillon, Jessica.Dillon@nvl.army.mil, no later than 13 Feb 2004.  This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make any award or to pay for any response preparation costs.

<DESC>United Space Alliance (USA), LLC, through its offices located in Houston, Texas, is providing this RFI to assess interest from potential suppliers for a Space Shuttle Upgrades acquisition in support of the NASA Space Flight Operations Contract, NAS9-20000.  The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire Pulse Code Modulation Encoder (PCME) units for operational use on the Space Shuttle.  The PCME units will replace existing analog hardware and firmware of the Space Shuttle Modular Auxiliary Data System (MADS) with a fully digital data acquisition capability. The PCME will replace the Wide Band Signal Conditioners (WBSG), Strain Gauge Signal Conditioners (SGSC), Pulse Code Modulation (PCMU) units, and Frequency Division Multiplexer (FDM) units on Orbiter Vehicles (OV)-103, OV-104, and OV-105.  The PCME will be designed to support all ground and flight operations.    The PCME acquisition consists of two (2) increments: 1) formulation and 2) implementation. The formulation increment begins with contract award and concludes at PDR plus three (3) months. The implementation increment begins with the issuance of the authority to proceed (ATP) no later than PDR plus three (3) months and concludes with the successful completion of the first Space Shuttle flight with the PCME including resolution of all post-flight anomalies.  Multiple suppliers may be selected for the formulation increment with down selection to a single supplier team following PDR. USA is responsible for the PCME acquisition activities, and coordinates with its customer, NASA.  USA will be responsible for selection and subsequent oversight of the supplier teams.  The goal is to provide an upgraded PCME based on best overall value to NASA.  This Best Value assessment will be based on an integrated evaluation of the proposed approach.  An important consideration is the suitability of the proposed approach for operations in the Space Shuttle environments (radiation, shock, thermal, and vibration).   This informational synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor does its issuance restrict USA or the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  Neither USA nor the Government will reimburse the contractor for any cost associated with preparing or submitting a response to this informational notice.  A Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is expected to be released to interested suppliers on February 10, 2004, with a request for comments (including an ROM cost estimate for efforts through PDR plus three (3) months) to be provided to USA by February 18, 2004.  The final RFP is expected to be released March 15, 2004, with anticipated contract award on May 17, 2004.  The data that will be exchanged for the RFP and resulting subcontract are controlled by ITAR regulations, which prohibits data from being exported, released or disclosed to foreign nationals inside or outside of the United States without first obtaining an export license.  Therefore, participation in this acquisition is limited to US companies.  Please confirm compliance with this requirement in your response to the RFI. Suppliers interested in receiving the draft RFP and future correspondence related to the PCME acquisition should send notification in writing, on or before February 9, 2004, Monday, to the Buyer Procurement Representative identified below.  Please include primary and alternate contact information (name, address, phone number and email) for further exchange of information.

<DESC>The Bureau is interested in obtaining, testing, and evaluating technologies or materials with potential application for coating U.S. currency to enhance longevity and durability in circulation.

Coating materials or processes submitted must be compatible with all materials currently used to produce U.S. currency; i.e. currency paper, offset, intaglio and COPE inks, and security features.  Specifications for these materials are available upon request.  In addition, the coating must not significantly alter the appearance or distinctive feel of currency paper, as these characteristics are part of a longstanding tradition that the public has come to trust and associate with U.S. currency.  The prospective materials and processes used to apply them may be considered for any stage of currency production—from coatings applied to the paper substrate before any printing to coatings applied after all printing has been completed.  Benefits that might be expected to result from the coatings include, but are not limited to, soiling resistance, moisture resistance, ink adhesion, enhanced print quality, ink set-off resistance (when sheets are stacked during production), and improvements in mechanical properties of the notes such as folding endurance and tear strength.  Other factors to be considered in the evaluation of coatings and/or coating processes will be compatibility with production flow, environmental acceptability, and cost.  Other appropriate representatives from the the Department of Treasury and/or Federal Reserve Bank may also review technologies or materials submitted to the Bureau.  The Bureau may also submit offered technologies to other technical experts under government contracts for their evaluation.

For initial screening purposes, interested parties are requested to submit preliminary samples and/or brief technical descriptions (1-2 paragraphs) plus cost estimates for the purchase of larger test quantities to the BEP, Office of Procurement, Attn:  Cindy Duncan, 14th & C Streets, S.W., Washington, D.C.  20228.  Larger quantities of samples may be procured through simplified acquisition (small purchase) for further evaluation.  Previously submitted materials or technologies need not resubmit.  If you have any questions please contact Cindy Duncan on (202) 874-2539 or e-mail cynthia.duncan@bep.treas.gov.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice to determine the ability of vendors that can provide commercial of the shelve (COTS) package and services to provide payroll support for the Commissioned Officers of the United States Public Health Service (PHS).  There are currently 6,000 health professionals on active duty entitled to the same pays and allowances as members of the other United States uniformed services.  They are stationed throughout the United States and overseas.  They work for agencies of the Department of Health and Human Services such as the Indian Health Service, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control, etc., as well as other federal agencies such as the Coast Guard and Bureau of Prisons.
The staff of the Commissioned Corps Systems Branch (CCSB) currently provides payroll IT services (in-house). The CCSB staff use two software systems and an interface system that connects them.  This potential acquisition will require vendors to replace the first system, which collects data from source documents.  Vendors may opt to replace the second system, which performs the gross-to-net operations as well.  Alternatively, the second system could be retained but a new interface would have to be provided.
The first software system is a legacy COBOL application running on a WANG minicomputer.  It provides for data input from personnel and payroll source documents.  The transactions are edited at point of origin and then combined with any other input documents for that employee to determine all changes since the last instance.  Pay determination is by exception only; the default is to receive the same pay as the previous (monthly) cycle.  In addition to proactive changes, the system is able to detect changes due to longevity milestones.  These longevity changes occur for both base pay and several types of specialty pay to which an officer may be entitled.  The system also stores large tables provided by DOD to determine the amount of housing allowance officers are entitled to based on their grade, dependent status, and duty station zip code.  Since officers can be called to duty, transferred, or separated at any point during the payroll cycle, the system must be able to determine prorated earnings for all categories of pay.  Since supporting documentation may arrive after the fact (i.e., change in marital status), the system must be able to perform retroactive adjustments for, at a minimum, all pay cycles in the current tax year.  Contemplated system requirements will include: (1) compliance with existing CCSB standards and processes, (2) the system should be web-based using modern tools according to accepted standards, (3) it must allow for different levels of roles and responsibilities, (4) certain transactions that do not effect an officer’s gross pay (i.e. tax withholding, payroll address, savings allotment, etc.) should be self-service, (5) transactions that require review and approval (i.e. dependent certification) should be initiated by the officer and forwarded to a payroll specialist before being finalized, (6) other transactions (i.e. bonus pays) are initiated and/or approved by members of the officer’s organization prior to being forwarded to the payroll specialist  (7) the system should display an earnings statement on the web that shows each element of pay, both current and year-to-date, indicate whether it is taxable or non-taxable, and each deduction and allotment to gross pay and (8), before the end of January each year, the system should display the officer’s W-2 statement.  Both of these documents should be available for printing.  The data base engine should be accessible for standard an ad hoc reports using commercially available packages.
The second software system runs on an IBM mainframe.  It stores all the data necessary to perform gross-to-net calculations.  It accepts 80-column input transactions according to specialized formats to create and update information for an officer.  It keeps track of both taxable and non-taxable earnings.  It performs federal, state, and local tax calculations using tables provided by a third-party vendor.  It creates output files for EFT transactions to banks, insurance companies, Thrift Savings Plan, charities, U.S. Savings Bonds, tax entities, etc.  It provides output data in a format suitable for auditors and historical review.  It does not dispense funds but rather provides data to the U.S. Treasury in predefined formats.
If the vendor were not providing a gross-to-net solution, then it would have to develop an interface to take the transactions generated by the first system and convert them to meet the requirements of the mainframe software.
Potential vendors must possess extensive knowledge of the CCSB payroll systems, subsystems, and program processes as well as expertise in the data & system reliability, maintainability and data quality assurance.
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFQ), INVITATION FOR BID (IFB), REQUEST FOR APPLICATION (RFA) OR AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATES THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD THE CONTRACT. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps. It is the offeror responsibility to monitor this site for any solicitation and synopsis. Interested offerors/vendors having the required capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement of 5 pages or less indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein. 
Responses must include the following: name and address of firm, size of business, average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantage, 8(a), HUBZone, woman-owned, Historically Black College or University and/or Minority Service Institute; number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number). Additional documentation such as company literature, brochures, and references are welcome. Please submit your capability statements or questions about this document to Hector G. Vega, phone (301) 443-7077, email Hvega@psc.gov, or mail: Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Division of Acquisition Management, Parklawn Building Room 5-101, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville MD 20857.

<SUBJECT>K--System Architecture  and Engineering Changes for the development of a single baseline ground system, the Improved Communication Equipment (ICEcube).
<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (GovWorks), intends to make a sole source award to Aeronix, Inc. The estimate cost of this award is $250,000.00. This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of Interior Franchise on behalf of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). This award is for system architecture and engineering changes for the development of a single baseline ground system, the Improved Communication Equipment (ICEcube) for the Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC and is a follow-on award to a uniquely qualified source. Awarding the contract to another vendor at this point would most likely result in duplication of work, effort, time and cost to the Government. To bring a new vendor in at this crucial time would impede the process of the program; the learning curve for the new vendor would delay program completion by a minimum of 8 to 10 months and nearly double the cost. The intent of this synopsis is for informational purpose only. This is Not a request for competitive quotes. However, all information received within (5) days of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

STATEMENT OF WORK/SPECIFICATION

C.3 SPECIFICATION

The INL/A single engine eradication aircraft performs a variety of missions.  At times the aircraft operate from forward operating base locations under primitive conditions and at other times from international airports with instrument only approaches.  The primary mission is to locate and eradicate illicit narcotic producing plants.  This mission requires that the aircraft have (relative to standard production agricultural spray aircraft) exceptional range and endurance, as well as the capability to fly aerial application operations at altitudes up to 12,000 ft. MSL.  Operations are often flown in very rugged mountainous terrain that requires optimum climb and turn performance at high-density altitudes.  Illicit crops are usually grown in remote areas with few bases from which to operate aircraft.  For this reason, the aircraft is required to have much greater range than standard agricultural spray aircraft.   Reconnaissance missions flown by this airframe are in the same rugged environment as the aerial eradication, but generally require even greater endurance to cover large areas of remote territory.  Further, the aircraft and crews are frequently targeted by hostile fire.  Most hits received have been from NATO ball 7.62mm (sometimes steel core armor piercing) and smaller arms.  A swath guidance system is currently installed on the fleet and is used primarily as a spray guidance system and a spray area organizational tool, but also has a secondary function as a mission recorder providing a vital database for spray analysis and mission evaluation.

C.3.1.  The Department of State’s Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) Office of Aviation (A) has a requirement for aerial herbicide application airplanes to support the USG’s counter narcotics mission.
