<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation announcement. This is NOT an invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Proposal (RFP), or a Request for Application (RFA) and in no way obligates the US Government to award a contract or cooperative agreement.  However, potential sources that may be interested in this competitive process are requested to mail, fax, or e-mail their interest to the contact address by May 7, 2004.   The United States for International Development (USAID) plans to support a new program that seeks to strengthen the competitiveness of rural enterprises in Bolivia’s coca growing regions of the Cochabamba Tropics (also known as “the Chapare”) and the Yungas of La Paz, Bolivia. 

USAID’s new, consolidated rural competitiveness activity will focus on helping remove policy, regulatory, institutional, on-farm, and market constraints to more efficient on and off-farm rural enterprises through a private sector-focused and market-led approach.  Strengthened competitiveness will be achieved by linking Chapare and Yungas value chains with emerging regional trade regimes and local markets, and helping to ensure that these value chains can produce according to the demand specifications of these markets.  Increased competitiveness of rural enterprises will lead to decreasing donor subsidies for these enterprises over the life of the activity.  Ultimately, USAID anticipates that this activity will help rural enterprises in coca growing areas to increase value, employment and incomes in a licit market economy.  With the contract to be awarded through the RFP anticipated herein, USAID is seeking to consolidate the Mission’s current basket of similar economic development activities currently carried out in two separate regions by different implementers, into one major rural competitiveness activity implemented by a lead contractor and any associated partners, across both regions.  

USAID/Bolivia encourages qualified offerors to submit thoughtful and innovative approaches that have a high potential for achievement of the project objectives.  We anticipate issuing RFP 511-04-018 o/a May 11, 2004.  Proposals due date will be approximately August 11, 2004.  Organizations interested in responding to the forthcoming RFP should consider participating in a pre-proposal conference scheduled to take place by approximately the end of June, 2004.

In addition, NOAA requires the expansion of its Relocation Manager™ license from 1000 vouchers per year to 2000 vouchers per year.  The DoC intends to procure these services, on a sole source basis, from ePCS Support Services, 21351 Ridgetop Circle, Dulles, VA 20166.  Sole source justification to support the acquisition of these services is based on the fact that ePCS Support Services is the exclusive authorized federal reseller of Gelco’s Relocation Manager™.  See numbered note 22.  The Government intends to make award by September 30, 2004.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology plans to support a program of study which will investigate the feasibility of implementing quantum information processing techniques with trapped ions in order to improve atomic clocks and frequency standards.  The initial focus of the work will be rf trap experiments which investigate recently proposed techniques for reading out the state of a "clock" ion by quantum mechanically coupling the internal state of this clock ion to a read-out ion.   However, the work will involve other rf trap as well as possibly Penning ion trap experiments as well.  The work is experimental, must be conducted at the NIST ion trapping labs, and requires a high level of experience with ion traps, dye lasers and frequency doubling to ultraviolet wavelengths, and experimental atomic physics.  Place of performance:  NIST Boulder Labs; Period of Performance: Twelve months.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), 	Radiation Biology Branch (RBB), plans to procure on a sole source basis a Replacement of Cobalt-60 source in Eldorado 8 irradiator with MDS Nordion, Inc., PO Box 13500, 447 March Road, Kanata, Ontario K2K1X8, Canada.   The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.   The Radiation Biology Branch conducts studies on cellular and whole animal responses to gamma-irradiation, and the effects of radio-protectors and sensitizers. This requires irradiating cells or small animals using an Eldorado 8 cobalt-60 teletherapy machine. Because cobalt-60 decays with a half-life of 5 years, our irradiator is currently operating at one-half the dose rate.  The RBB provides support for several other NCI branches that conduct radiation biology studies, a well as a branch of NHLBI. All of these users are inconvenienced by the increasingly long irradiation times.  This procurement will provide for the safe removal and transport of the existing cobalt-60 source and replacement with a minimum 150 rmm source. A higher activity source will restore the dose rate of the irradiator to its original level, increasing our efficiency and providing for more reliable results.  Replacing a radioactive cobalt-60 source is a highly technical operation, to be done by trained personnel with specialized equipment. The cobalt-60 sources used in this machine are extremely radioactive and thus pose an extreme danger unless handled by professionals. They must be transported and installed by personnel who are specifically trained to handle the sources and to install them in our irradiator. The Eldorado 8 irradiator was built by Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd, now owned by MDS Nordion. They are the only company who has personnel specifically trained to replace cobalt-60 sources in Eldorado 8 irradiators. Their personnel have been trained to service Eldorado 8 irradiators, and have worked on our irradiator previously. They are familiar with the physical layout of the building and are equipped to move the sources safely through the building.  MDS Nordion, Inc. is the only source known to the NCI that can supply the cobalt-60.    This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, September 15, 2004.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Solicitation number must be cited on all correspondence, NCI-40151-NG.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement to produce a dataset and supporting analysis for use by LaRC to evaluate the feasibility of Modulated Fiber Laser Lidars for the remote sensing of Carbon Dioxide (CO2).  The data provided under this effort will be used to support assessment in support of an anticipated proposal to the Earth Science System Pathfinder (ESSP) Announcement of Opportunity-4 (AO-4).  3.0	GENERAL REQUIREMENTS The contractor is conducting an airborne field campaign to demonstrate the performance of a Modulated Fiber Laser Lidar for Climate Studies.  The objectives for the field campaign is to 1) demonstrate that the contractor’s Column Measurement System Architecture design will make high precision determinations of column CO2 in the Lower Troposphere, and 2) to demonstrate that the architecture, when scaled to space, will meet space measurement requirements. The contractor will provide a sensor suite to include the CO2 Lidar, O2 (for pressure) Lidar, and the laser altimeter, along with CO2 in-situ sensors. Data would be obtained and retrievals made over regions of varying reflectivity and pressure and during daytime and nighttime.	At a minimun, data collection will conducted over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) Central Facility operated by DOE. Data will be collected during the overflights for characterization and verification of the sensor(s) performance in retrieving the CO2 and O2 in the Lower Troposphere using SGP site data. Flight data would be used to update the performance model for estimates of scalability to space. The flights will take place in September when the availability of the CO2, O2 and laser Ranger sensors would all be ready and thus comprise the ESSP brassboard system. The contractor shall provide the resources (personnel, facilities, material, and services) to perform and accomplish the tasks stated within this SOW and contract. 3.1	Airborne Demonstration Data 3.1.1	Task Description The contractor shall provide data supporting the assessment of the contractor’s Modulated Fiber Laser Lidar technology to make measurements of CO2 in the Lower Troposphere.   NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from ITT Industries.  ITT Industries is the only known source and no other source will satisfy agency requirements because only ITT Industries can produce data from 1.5 um fiber-based CO2 lidar of value to support the ESSP proposal development efforts. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 3, 2004.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE SINGLE SOURCE CONTRACTS to:  Covenant Aviation Security at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and Tupelo Lemons Municipal Airport (TUP); FirstLine Transportation Security, Inc. at Kansas City International Airport (MCI); Jackson Hole Airport Board at Jackson Hole, Wyoming Airport (JAC); and McNeil Technologies, Inc. at Greater Rochester International (ROC) airport for passenger and baggage screening services.  These contracts were established in accordance with the AVIATION AND TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT (ATSA) (Public Law 107-71), specifically Section 44919 entitled SECURITY SCREENING PILOT PROGRAM.  The period of performance for these pilot contracts was two years.  
 
These contracts were competitively awarded and are due to expire on November 18, 2004.   These single source contracts to the companies listed above are bridge contracts for one year plus a six month option, to be exercised if needed and extend the current screening services being performed under the original contracts.  The bridge contracts are necessary because:
1)	The current contracts expire November 18, 2004 and ATSA sets November 19, 2004 as the application date for airport operators to request that screening be done by qualified private companies.  It is envisioned that the pilot program airports will be required to submit applications in accordance ATSA, Section 44920 entitled SECURITY SCREENING OPT-OUT PROGRAM in November 2005.  (The OPT-OUT program is also referred to as the SCREENER PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM (SPP).  The extension of the services will allow applications for continued contract screening to be processed in accordance with the Screener Partnership Program criteria.
2)	One of the key goals of the pilot program is to provide TSA with lessons learned and best practices as the agency moves forward with the consideration of additional privatized screening operations 

This announcement constitutes the intentions of the Transportation Security Administration to enter into an award with Covenant Aviation Security; FirstLine Transportation Security, Inc.; Jackson Hole Airport Board; and McNeil Technologies, Inc., on a single source basis in accordance with the Transportation Security Administration Acquisition Management System.    

Alternative services will not be considered.  This NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.

The University of Southern California has access to a database that  includes various medical information for more than 100,000 persons in Ontario, Canada.

However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting documentation to Kimberli Irwin at the office identified above, by fax (513)487-2109 or by e-mail (irwin.kimberli@epa.gov) which establishes that their  specifications meet the EPA's requirement.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research, Genetics Branch, plans to procure on a sole source basis with Affymetrix Inc., 3380 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95051 for yeast deletion bar coded oligo arrays.   The Genetics Branch widely utilized the yeast deletion mutants for genetic and phenotypic analysis.  The final readout is done by visual scoring of 6,000 strains which is a time consuming process that is prone to errors. Affymetrix has produced an array where yeast deletion strains were built with a unique barcode that matches to a precise location with respect to each gene. This permits rapid analysis of growth using the arrays with the barcodes.  This technology has been used effectively and efficiently to evaluate genetic interactions and more recently for drug screens using yeast as a model system.  This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. Affymetrix, Inc. is the only organization known that has the aforementioned features that are required and believed to be unique and only their products will work with NCI’s Government owned Affymetrix equipment.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement it may submit a statement of capabilities.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The PROGRAM SCOPE AND FUNDING sections of the notice and the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) are clarified to state the following:  No award under this BAA will exceed $4.0M.  It is expected that the typical award size for a 12-month effort will be between $0.5 and $2.0M.

The detailed proposal information contained in the PIP for Section E “Innovative Claims, Statement of Work and Deliverables,” is hereby revised to read:

E.  Innovative Claims, Statement of Work and Deliverables {8}:
Describe the project goals and innovative claims. Define the technical tasks to be performed. For each task, provide:

1.	A short description of the objectives;
2.	A short description of the approach;  
3.	Identification of organization or team members responsible for task execution;
4.	The resources allocated (cost, person-months);
5.	The milestones and deliverables.

Describe any interdependencies between the tasks. Provide schedule graphics. Include in this section all proprietary claims to results, prototypes, or systems supporting and/or necessary for the use of the research, results, and/or prototype.  If there are no proprietary claims, this should be stated.  The offeror must submit a separate list of all technical data or computer software that will be furnished to the Government with other than unlimited rights (see DFARS 227).  

Offerors are also encouraged to provide a longer-term vision for the project by describing the possible deliverables and milestones that might be targeted in the 36 months following the initial Phase I 12 months.

Due to discrepancies regarding submission requirements between the PIP PROPOSAL SUBMISSION instructions and the ABSTRACT AND PROPOSAL FORMAT section of the notice, the following will take precedence:

Proposers must submit an original and 4 2-sided hard copies (5 total) and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the abstract or full proposal (in PDF or Microsoft Word 2000 for IBM-compatible format on a 3.5-inch floppy disk, 100 MB Iomega Zip disk or cd).  Mac-formatted disks will not be accepted.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 04-38, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy number x of 2.  The hard copies should be stapled at top left corner and should not be bound. Please do not attach a plastic cover.

<DESC>Formal posting of Request for Proposals (RFP) M67004-04-R-0061 for Joint Services Transportable Decontamination System - Small Scale (JSTDS-SS).  The Governments intent is to procure a commercial off the shelf (COTS) technology/Non-Developmental Item (NDI) in support of the Joint Services Family of Decontamination (JSFDS) under the Joint Program Manager for Decontamination (JPM-DC).  The JSTDS-SS goal is to acquire a small scale decontamination system to include applicators and decontaminants, with full logistical support. The applicator will replace the M17 Light-weight Decontamination System and expand its capability to apply decontaminants for thorough decontamination.  The objective of the JSTDS-SS Program is to provide an increase in the warfighters decontamination capability through the fielding of JSTDS-SS over base year and four option years.  The goal for decontamination is to provide an effective decontamination capability that is more environmentally friendl! y and reduces the logistics footprint.  A Statement of Objectives (SOO) approach is chosen to identify the services and supplies.  This solicitation request for proposals (RFP) M67004-04-R-0061 describes the objectives that must be achieved, instructions to offerors, evaluation of proposals.  Contractors will develop a performance statement of work (SOW) for production of a transportable decontamination system, including training support and materiels, and implementation of performance based logistics optimizing availability at the lowest possible life-cycle cost.  Note: a separate procurement action will be implemented to support testing (Phase II Downselection) for those offerors in the competitive range for Phase II, therefore offerors must address ability to meet quantities identified in Clause 52.212-2 (Phase II will require test samples, interim contractor support for duration of thise phase).  The primary North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) is 33! 3999.  All questions regarding the contents of this RFP are to be directed to the points of contact: Nannette Carter-Jafri (email: carter-jafrind@logcom.usmc.mil) at 229-639-6166, or Larry McNutt (email: Larry.McNutt.ctr@usmc.mil) at 229-639-8088.

This Request For Information (RFI) is part of UDLPs contract with TARDEC, and is intended to identify potential Offerors that have products and capabilities to arrive at system or subsystem materiel solutions for a counter kinetic energy (KE) threat techn ology (hereinafter referred to as the CKE Technology).   This is NOT a pre-solicitation notice pursuant to FAR Part 5. This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government or by United Defense LP.  The current active defense system program incorporates both hard kill and soft kill countermeasures for Chemical Energy (CE) threat defeat. For the purpose of this RFI survey, an active defense system is a system that physically interacts with a threat mun ition or munition delivery system in such a manner as to prevent the threat from destroying the protected vehicle. Examples of counter KE active defense technologies include integrated flyout interceptors incorporating blast and focused warheads as well as  laser dazzlers. A typical hard kill active protection system detects and tracks incoming threat projectiles, then uses that threat information to compute a fire control solution. This fire control solution is used to direct the initiation of an integrated  interceptor subsystem (interceptor). This interceptor flies out to an optimized intercept point, deploys a countermeasure payload, and interacts with the incoming threat in such a way that it is no longer sufficiently lethal to destroy the protected the v ehicle. The vehicle will typically have 360 degree machine gun armor protection with frontal medium cannon protection. Any proposed integrated interceptor shall be propelled by a recoilless propulsion system, shall incorporate all sensors and controls nece ssary to achieve the desired threat/countermeasure interaction, and shall incorporate all necessary safety and control systems. Alternately, the active defense system may detect the presence of a Kinetic Energy Projectile  (KEP) capable shooter and disrupt  its ability to acquire a fire control solution through the employment of a soft kill countermeasure (e.g. laser dazzler). The purpose of this survey is to determine what technology is available for near term incorporation of a counter KE capability within  the existing ADS program. Interested firms should go to the TARDEC website at http://www.tacom.army.mil/tardec/news006.htm for the RFI. Your responses will assist in finalizing plans for this effort and allow better definition of requirements. Information  acquired from this technology survey will be used to help refine planning of further/future efforts. In addition, United Defense plans to conduct component evaluations during the period of September 2004 through July 2005 at a site(s) to be determined. Ne ither the Government nor United Defense will reimburse contractors for any costs incurred as a result of their participation in this RFI survey.  If offerors provide hardware/components for evaluation/testing, neither UDLP or the U.S. Government will be re sponsible for any damage or destruction to the hardware or components caused during handling/testing of the equipment. UDLP and the U.S. Government will employ due diligence in handling all hardware/components provided for consideration.  The offerors are responsible for all expenses associated with shipping the hardware/components they want considered/evaluated to and from the testing location. Submit survey documentation preferably by email to the POC below no later than 15 Sep 04.  All survey docume ntation must be in English. Proprietary data, if submitted, should be marked as such. United Defense is prepared to enter into proprietary information Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA) with respondents. If any portion of the survey response is classified, co ntact the POC provided below for instructions.  Documentation provided will not be returned.   Questions about this RFI should be directed to the applicable United Defense POC listed below. Contractual questions, and the corresponding answers may be posted  to Lee Pete Peterson (lee.peterson@udlp.com). The United Defense technical Point of Contact is Jeff Faul (jeffrey.faul@udlp.com). Email your questions to Pete Peterson at lee.peterson@udlp.com.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS; IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER TYPES OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.  This is a sources sought/market research conducted in accordance with FAR Part 10.  The 16th Special Operations Wing (SOW), Hurlburt AFB FL is currently performing market research to determine what types of commercial service offerings and related capabilities currently exist for Command and Control (C2) Dispatch Systems.  The 16 SOW seeks responses to this RFI from commercial sources to indicate what kinds of C2 dispatch system equipment they currently offer.  Current communication systems available are antiquated often requiring extensive repairs and do not meet the needs of the wing.  Background: Command Post is the nucleus of the 16th SOW, open 24/7, 365 days a year, and contains the facilities and communication equipment to conduct emergency actions, operational reporting, multi-aircraft mission monitoring and routine air and ground command and control functions.  Current C2 communications equipment environment is predominantly a manual operation with separate non-integrated systems, limited conferencing capabilities, thus hindering emergency action controller procedures.  In responding to this RFI, respondents should indicate whether currently commercially available solutions are available that could provide the following services/capabilities and exactly how the system works.  Dispatch system functions required are: (1) Total system to consolidate all command post processes into a single, integrated console unit; (2) Telephone system with push-to-talk handsets, headsets, and caller ID capability; (3) One-touch and hands-free operations; (4) Base alerting pyramid recall capabilities via touch screen telephone features; (5) Automated notification feedback (printer compatible); (6) Instant telephone conferencing with LMR, landline telephones, cell phones, air-to-ground, or SATCOM radios as required; minimum required 22 conferees simultaneously; (7) Public address announcement (Base Alert and Warning System) interface; (8) Land Mobile Radio (LMR), UHF/VHF/SATCOM radio interface; (9) Programmable macro keys to adapt to the wing’s dynamic C2 environment; (10) Telephone and radio recording feature; (11) Fax capabilities; (12) Voice over Internet protocol (IP); (13) System must be expandable, universal, and collaborative with other C2 systems; (14) Touch screen panel to facilitate all dispatch functions listed herein.  Finally, the 16 SOW seeks commercial price list information (or possible range of pricing if commercial price list does not exist) for dispatch systems, as noted above, that are currently available in the marketplace.  This pricing should reflect how current dispatch systems are currently priced and structured for commercial marketplace sales, including any tiered pricing that is available.  GSA items shall be noted as well as the GSA contract number.  Respondents should email responses and, if available, commercially available literature and commercial price list information to richard.bremer@hurlburt.af.mil no later than 6 Sep 04.  Such responses will be used to assist the 16 SOW in determining how to construct minimum requirements in the event that procurement is conducted in the future.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of Wastewater Collection and Treatment, Potable Water, and Service Water Systems at Picatinny Arsenal, Morris County, New Jersey.
Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operation, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility systems replacement.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm(s) will be selected to assume ownership of the system(s) to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to own, operate, and maintain the utility system(s).  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc. of the systems to assure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, operate, and maintain the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility systems will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offeror's shall be submitted as directed by the RFP.  The Installation and utility systems being privatized are described as follows:

OVERVIEW
Picatinny Arsenal is located in New Jersey’s Morris County, approximately 40 miles west of New York City.  The installation has over 1,000 buildings, and covers nearly 6,500 acres. The Installation Management Agency is the proponent for all Installation infrastructure and support operations at Picatinny. Tenant organizations include the Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Program Executive Office for Ammunition, Program Executive Officer for Ground Combat Support, and the Program Executive Office for Soldier.

Wastewater Collection and Treatment System Description

WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT
The WWTP has an estimated design capacity of 1.0 million gallons per day (MGD), is permitted to treat 0.50 MGD, and presently treats an average flow of 0.29 MGD. Lift Station No. 80A is located at the WWTP and lifts all sanitary waste into the plant for treatment. Wastewater receives primary treatment in two Imhoff tanks followed by secondary treatment using a fixed-film process where fixed nozzles distribute wastewater over rock media. Wastewater is then clarified in a 28-foot diameter secondary clarifier. Primary sludge and fixed-film humus (secondary clarifier sludge) is stored in the digestion compartment of the Imhoff tanks until it is stabilized. Stabilized sludge is then transported by service contract to a federally approved and permitted disposal site.
Treated effluent is pumped off government property for final treatment and disposal at the Rockaway Valley Regional Sewage Authority (RVRSA), a 12-MGD facility in Boonton, New Jersey, five miles away. A standby diesel generator supports the lift station and Picatinny pretreatment facility.

COLLECTION SYSTEM
The existing collection system is generally constructed of vitrified clay and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe with manholes at approximately 350-foot intervals. System piping varies from 2-inch force mains to 18-inch gravity flow sewers. Most of the original system was installed in the 1930s and 1940s. The hilly topography of the Installation allows gravity flow of wastewater for short distances followed by lifting. Flows are generally in a southerly direction except for a small collection area that lies south of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) near the Main Gate. The wastewater collection system presently consists of approximately 137,230 feet of trunk sewers, mains, and force mains. The system includes 19 lift stations of many different designs ranging from ejector systems to simplex guide rail submersible pump designs, to dry well triplex systems.

Potable Water System Description
The potable water system, initially constructed in the 1920s, has a current water demand of approximately 500,000 gallons. The system may include, but is not limited to, wells, pump stations, treatment plant, pipelines, valves, fire hydrants, storage facilities, pumps, and meters.  Although not connected to the Picatinny potable water system, the potable water treatment facility for the Advanced Warhead Development Facility (AWDF) at Building 642 is included in this privatization study solicitation, and the AWDF potable water treatment facility shall be included with the sale of the Picatinny potable water system, should such a determination be made as a result of the solicitation.

POTABLE WATER PRODUCTION, TREATMENT, AND STORAGE
Raw water is drawn from three main wells, No. 131, No. 410 (refurbished with limited capacity), and No. 302 (recently refurbished). Well water contains volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including trichloroethylene (TCE), which are removed in the treatment process.
The water treatment plant (WTP), Building No. 1383, was constructed in the mid-1980s. The WTP is rated at 1.0 million gallons per day (MGD) and serves only Picatinny Arsenal. Water demand presently averages 500,000 gallons per day (GPD) regardless of season. The New Jersey Department of Environment Protection water permit, which expires 30 April 2008, allows a maximum draw of ground and surface water not to exceed 1,788 million gallons per year or 149 million gallons per month. There are no connections that would permit emergency access to the nearby municipal systems.
Well pumps transfer raw water to a primary surge tank at the treatment facility where three raw-water pumps pressurize three 8-foot diameter x 16-foot long greensand filters. Potassium permanganate and soda ash are introduced into the raw-water flow to begin the iron and manganese removal process. Filter media is regenerated using potassium permanganate solution and greens and media rinse and is backwashed into a 16-foot diameter x 18-foot high backwash storage tank. Filtered water then flows under pressure to an air-stripping tower where TCE is removed followed by chlorination. Fluoridation completes the treatment process. Backwash wastes and residuals are discharged into the sanitary sewer system. Finished water is then pumped through a detention tank (completing the disinfection process) into elevated storage tanks located throughout the distribution system. Two ground-level storage reservoirs (No. 1381 and No. 1382) located at the treatment complex are replenished from the distribution system. An adjacent structure, Facility No.1381-A, houses two fire protection pumps that draw water from the ground storage reservoirs and boost the flow in the potable water distribution system when needed. Standby power for the WTP is furnished by a 450 kW diesel generator set with sufficient capacity to operate treatment-related equipment as well as raw and treated water pumps. The WTP operation includes a small laboratory for analyzing water samples. A master meter at the WTP records gross plant output.
The WTP and distribution system is manned seven days per week, eight hours per day. Several critical elements of the water system are controlled from the WTP by a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, utilizing remote terminal units (RTUs).
Three ground storage reservoirs, Tank Nos. 1381, 1382 (mentioned above), and 3214 plus three elevated storage tanks, Nos. 1300, 3141, and 3254 provide a total of approximately 1.5 million gallons of potable water storage. In addition raw water is stored in Tank 1091, a 100,000 gallon elevated tank. Water is pumped to Tank 1091 and is used to supply the water plant, as well as providing water to a series of fire hydrants north of the tank.

The potable water treatment facility at the AWDF, located in Building 642, is similar to the operation at the Water Treatment Plant at Building 1383. The AWDF treatment facility includes an air stripper with blower, three chemical mixers, and chlorine solution and potassium permanganate for alkalinity feed. The treatment facility also has a green sand filter for iron and manganese removal; monitor equipment for flow, turbidity, pH and cl2; a storage tank; a pressure tank; and, a carbon filter.

POTABLE WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
Due to significant changes in topography, three distinct pressure zones exist within the distribution system: a low-pressure zone (Lower Area), a medium pressure zone (Navy Hill Area), and a high-pressure zone (1300 and 1400 areas). Two pump stations are used in the distribution network: Structure No. 3013, which maintains the water level in Tank 3214 and Structure 1061, an in-line pumping system. A standby generator set, capable of operating a single 100 gallons per minute (gpm) transfer pump, supports Structure No. 3013.
The distribution system is constructed of approximately 217,000 linear feet of water mains and lateral lines ranging in size from less than 2 inches to 12 inches. The system includes main valves, pressure reducing stations, valve vaults, post indicator valves, monitoring and warning systems, and fire hydrants. The majority of the system was installed prior to 1950 and consists of unlined cast iron. During the late 1990s through the present, projects have been undertaken to replace a significant amount of older pipe. The most recent project,   when completed in the next 12 months, will have installed 33,600 linear feet of ductile iron pipe. No service laterals are included in these additions. The new pipe runs parallel to existing pipe and is connected to this pipe at frequent intervals.  Once laterals to the new lines are completed, the old lines could then be retired. 
The number and location of hydrants are adequate for fire fighting. System valve locations are adequate for isolating sections of the distribution system for repairs.

Service Water System Description
Picatinny employs a service water system that is totally separate from the potable system. The system supplies water for industrial processes, boiler make-up, non-contact cooling, fire suppression, building sprinklers, deluge systems, and flush water for numerous restrooms. The system also provides irrigation for an 18-hole golf course; however, the golf course sub-system is maintained by golf course personnel and is excluded from privatization. Service water is neither treated nor chlorinated since chlorine residuals would be incompatible with some industrial applications.

WATER PRODUCTION AND STORAGE
Raw service water is pumped from two lakes on the Installation. Each lake supplies a separate area of the distribution system resulting in two distinct service water storage and distribution systems. The two systems are not interconnected.
Lake Picatinny, with a volume of 560 acre-feet and a surface area of 100 acres, supplies approximately 95 percent of the service water for the Installation. Three centrifugal pumps located in the Power House (steam generating plant, Building 506) pull lake water through coarse intake screens and fill a cluster of ground storage tanks (623, a, b, c, d, and e). The water is then distributed into the service water system, replenishing ground storage Tanks 75, 75a, 639, as needed. Water levels are monitored visually in the Tank 623 cluster with no telemetry or water level sensors currently in use. Raw service water is not metered at the Power House; however, pump run time records are maintained by Power House personnel, which are then translated in estimates of the volume of water delivered to the system. Estimated pumped volumes average 450,000 to 500,000 gallons per day. Pressures in the lower areas of the average 80 pounds per square inch (psi).
Lake Denmark, with a volume of 1,015 acre-feet and a surface area of 280 acres, provides service water for the 1500 and 3500-3800 areas. Two (2) raw water pumps located in Building 1219 pull water through a coarse screen intake and lift it into Tank 1500 for distribution. Estimated flow, based on pump run times, averages 25,000 to 30,000 gallons per day. The water level in Tank 1500 is monitored remotely at the Water Treatment Plant.

SERVICE WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
The service water system consists of approximately 138,000 feet of mains and lateral lines ranging in size from less than 2 inches to 12 inches. The service water system generally serves those buildings with numbers smaller than 100, 100-900, 1500, 3500, and the 3800 group (approximately 110 buildings). The majority of the system was constructed in the 1940s and has been extended to accommodate additional buildings. Since the water is not treated, there are frequent problems associated with leaking valves that do not seat, water odor, etc. Spent service water, not used for non-contact cooling, is discharged to the sanitary wastewater collection system. A large percentage of the one-pass cooling water is discharged directly to the environment at eight EPA New Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES)-permitted outfalls.

<CONTACT>Deborah Wellen, Contract Specialist, Phone 618-229-9547, Fax 618-229-9174, Email Comsatcom@scott.disa.mil
<DESC>GENERAL: The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is seeking information that will help the Agency refine its current approach to the planning, provisioning, acquiring, managing, and operating commercial SATCOM services for the Combatant Commanders, the Services, and Department of Defense (DOD) agencies.

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, DISA is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party’s expense.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.   Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.   Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  Small Businesses are encouraged to provide responses to this RFI in order to assist DISA in determining potential levels of competition available in the industry, as well as helping to establish a basis for developing any subsequent potential subcontract plan goal percentages.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and the DISA contracting web page.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this RFI.

 The primary objectives of this RFI include soliciting ideas from industry for improving business practices, cost efficiencies, responsiveness, assured connectivity, and an enhanced global net-centric management capability. Additionally, transformational "next generation" type concepts include transitioning concepts that propose migration strategies from legacy to transformed solutions.  The Government seeks to understand the tradeoffs involved in deciding a strategy for acquiring commercial SATCOM services (i.e.,  C band, Ku band, Ka band, X-band, etc.) for DOD use. 

INFORMATION REQUESTED:  Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:  

a.  Concepts for acquiring commercial SATCOM services, e.g., contracting methods, operational relationships between the Government and industry. 

b.  Concepts for pricing models and processes that provide the Government with assurances that it receives goods and services at a fair and reasonable price, not only for its initial defined requirements, but for each and every new, unplanned requirement over the long term. 

c.  The manners and timeframes in which the Government is to pay for services to ensure the Government realizes the benefits of  "most favored customer" status. 

d.  Concepts that will limit DOD's risk of termination liability should changes in requirements necessitate early termination of a lease. 

e.  Concepts for monitoring the link performance collaboratively with our commercial providers on an end-to-end basis, and collaborative troubling shooting procedures in case of link degradation. 

f.  Concepts for providing teleport services and bandwidth management for optimizing transponder loading and performance. 

g.  Concepts for transition and synchronization of MILSATCOM programs.

h.  Concepts including terms and conditions that would permit portability of all or some leased bandwidth from one theater of operations to another, in case that is needed.

i.  Concepts that would leverage performance-based contracting arrangements. 

j.  Information that would allow the Government  to take advantage of volume discounts, bundling, and the requisite tradeoffs for offering such terms and conditions, and preferences and incentives for providers who proactively implement enhanced information assurance, cyber-security and physical security measures.   

Information should include a discussion for both single and multiple vendor approaches with advantages and disadvantages for each approach, and a proposed pricing model which would allow the DOD to maximize cost efficiencies.

This RFI is open to new, innovative, unconventional and/or non-traditional alternative approaches to satisfying our need for satellite communications, including such concepts as joint ventures, special financing options, share-in-savings, alternatives to commercial leasing, trading for dedicated bandwidth, satellite launch capability, and/or other commercial satellite service equities, etc. 

 CATEGORIES OF COMMERCIAL SATELLITE NEEDS:  

Layer 1 - Long-term requirements - These requirements are for bulk and long-term services. The requirements are considered most stable and are less influenced by crisis scenarios and changing operational plans.  

Layer 2 - Pre-positioned Capacity - These requirements are for pre-positioned capacity and are directly related to DOD strategic planning. The requirements encompass global Combatant Command (COCOM) coverage.  

Layer 3 - Surge Requirements - These requirements are for extremely short notice surge capacity that might be needed in response to developing crisis. This layer is dynamic, difficult to accurately predict,  and may be directly related to world events. This layer is above and beyond Layers 1 and 2. The Layer 1 and Layer 2 services would be to support  long-term services or  strategic planning. These are expected to be priced at or below rates for the Most Favored Customer. Layer 3 services  would be acquired on an as-needed basis and are expected to be priced commensurate with the competitive pricing at the time of procurement. 

NETCENTRIC CONTROL AND RESPONSIVENESS: The Government must have continuing visibility of the status of the resources that have been leased. Concepts must address providing positive control of all assets through which services are provided to the Government. The Government envisions a need for acquiring a range of commercial satellite services.  The most common needs include: single channel per carrier simplex and duplex services; broadcast services; earth terminal and teleport services; end-to-end data services; foreign and domestic licenses and landing rights approvals including compliance with ITU/FCC regulations; testing and certifications as may be related to domestic and foreign approvals; system engineering services for link design and satellite bandwidth optimization; and system maintenance services.  Generally there are five (5) system architectures ( Fixed -to-fixed, Tactical-to-tactical, Reachback, Broadcast and UAV) for providing these services. Furthermore,  DOD also owns and operates several Teleports and Standardized Tactical Entry Point (STEP) sites. In this regard, DOD would like to discuss the concepts for transition and synchronization of these facilities to maximize their usage. The current (approximate) amount of traffic that DISA is currently supporting within the Commercial SATCOM Office (provided as a guide and does not reflect a projection of future requirements) is a capacity of 2,856.95 Mbps. TOTAL = Equivalent Capacity of Seventy-nine (79), 36-MHz Transponders.

DEFINITIONS:  

 a. Bundling:  Consolidating similar or disparate services for the purpose of minimizing aggregate costs. Bundling can include efficient consolidation of circuits in transponders and transponders in satellite(s) and can also include scheduling of services. 

b. Most Favored Customer:.  The status of a customer that through formal relationship or policy affords the customer the best terms and conditions offered by a provider of goods or services. 

c. Near-Real-Time:  This implies that there are no significant delays in providing services to the customer after a request for service has been formally submitted. 

d. Portability:  The ability to discontinue unneeded or underused services on one system or subsystem for the purpose of re-initiating these same or similar services on another system or subsystem at no or minimal additional costs to the customer. It can be noted that a "system" or "subsystem" could be comprised of one or more entities. Specifically, a system could be comprised of several satellite vendors and/or terrestrial carriers. 

e. Positive Control:  Real-time or near-real-time monitoring and control by, or on behalf of the Government of the physical assets providing services to ensure all users are properly accessing those services, there is no unauthorized use of those services, and anomalies or outages are quickly identified in order to effect rapid restoration of those services and to support rapid resolution of incidents of purposeful interference. 

f. Volume discounting:  This is interpreted as the practice of offering reductions to typical unit prices when a customer is demonstrably procuring a large quantity of an item or a large volume of services when individual orders are aggregated.  

Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a White Paper. White Papers shall be due no later than 2:00 pm CDST., 20 Sep 2004. Responses shall be limited to thirty (30) pages and submitted in accordance with the instructions that follow.

Section One of the White Paper shall provide administrative information, and shall include as a minimum: Respondents must include Company Name, Street Address, State, NINE-digit Zip Code, POC, POC telephone and fax numbers, email address, Company Size and Status.     If the company address includes a PO Box, the complete street address must also be provided.  Include the facility security clearance and  business size of the respondent.  Respondents shall classify their company size using North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 517310, Telecommunications Resellers (1,500 employees).  The number of pages in Section One of the White Paper are not included in the 30-page limitation.  Section 2 of the White Paper shall respond to the questions and issues of this RFI and shall be limited to 30 pages.

<SUBJECT>Z -- Extension of Contract F04684-98-C-0014, Launch Operations and Support Contract (LO&SC)
<DESC>The 30th Space Wing, Vandenberg Air Force Base, California anticipates extending the Launch Operations and Support Contract (LO&SC) #F04684-98-C-0014 with MCA Engineers Inc, commencing 1 Oct 04. By extending the LO&SC, launch critical services will be uninterrupted pending GAO decision on Protest of Contract Award. The actual length of the extension may vary from 30 to 123 days and may be issued in multiple increments/performance periods and is dependent upon the actual date of GAO decision.  The current LO&SC provides management, maintenance, repair, upgrade, demolition, engineering and on-site support for the Western Range launch, operation, and test facilities, infrastructure and equipment. Interested firms must have the ability to provide required expertise for launch critical services and the workforce to provide required services and on-site support upon award. All hiring and training of personnel, learning of mission critical systems, and required security clearances must be accomplished without interruption of the Western Range and launch schedules. Phase-in will not be included due to the criticality of services to be provided and the impact that would result from interruption of these services. The incumbent contractor will not provide transition training since this would cause the government a substantial duplication of cost. Interested parties may provide necessary information, including written capabilities statement, and past performance references to Vincent W. Sanford within 5 days of this publication.

<SUBJECT>15 -- Sole Source Notice - One Set of PA-18 Squared Slotted Wing Assemblies
<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Wildlife Services (WS) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Dakota Cub Aircraft located in Brandon, SD for one set of PA-18 squared slotted wing assemblies pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) – only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

The “Leading Edge Slot” wing design utilizes a “fixed” slot that is built into the airfoil contour.  It allows the wing to fly effectively at high angles of attack which can reduce the take-off and landing distances.  An additional safety benefit is the stall/spin resistance of this design.  

The wings are fabric covered, coated through silver and include control surfaces and fuel tanks.

Dakota Cub Aircraft holds both a FAA supplemental type certificate (STC) and a FAA parts manufacturing approval (PMA) for the PA-18 squared slotted wing assemblies

<SUBJECT>A -- Utilization of Hemodialysis Devices in an NIH-Sponsored Multi-Center Clinical Trial of Frequent  Dialysis for Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)
<DESC>>
DESCRIPTION:   The  National  Institute  of   Diabetes   and
Digestive  and  Kidney  Diseases  (NIDDK)  of  the  National
Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Health  and
Human  Services (DHHS) seek collaboration with  industry  to
provide dialysers and compatible tubing for hemodialysis for
use  in  an  NIH-sponsored multi-center  clinical  trial  of
frequent dialysis for patients with End-Stage Renal  Disease
(ESRD).
>

INTRODUCTION:  The NIDDK is planning to test whether  it  is
feasible  to  randomize a representative sample of  patients
with  ESRD  and  requiring  hemodialysis,  into  either  (a)
conventional thrice-weekly dialysis treatments, or  (b)  one
of two forms of frequent dialysis. Two clinical centers have
formed  regional groups to randomize 300 subjects to  either
conventional 3 times per week in-center dialysis or 6  times
per  week  in center dialysis. Another clinical  center  has
formed  a  consortium to randomize 300  subjects  to  either
conventional  3 times per week in-center hemodialysis  or  6
times  per week nocturnal hemodialysis at home.  The overall
study  is  named  Frequent Hemodialysis Network  (FHN).  The
following Clinical Centers will be recruiting patients:  The
Renal Research Institute (New York City); The University  of
California,  San Francisco; and Wake Forest University.  The
NIDDK-funded Data and Analysis Coordinating Center  will  be
the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.
>

STUDY  GOALS:   The overall goal of FHN is to evaluate  more
intensive hemodialysis in ESRD. The aim of this trial is  to
test  whether  it is feasible to randomize a  representative
sample  of  patients  with ESRD and requiring  hemodialysis,
into   either   (a)   conventional  thrice-weekly   dialysis
treatments,  or  (b) one of two forms of frequent  dialysis.
The  results  of these trials will determine  whether  NIDDK
should  continue  this  research with  a  large-scale  trial
powered  to measure the impact of more frequent dialysis  on
hard  endpoints  such  as  mortality  and/or  cardiovascular
outcomes.   The  major  outcomes  will  be  hospitalization,
quality  of  life and left ventricular mass. Other  clinical
measurements  will  also  be  collected.  The  duration   of
treatment  for  each subject will be one year.   The  trials
will  also provide preliminary data on the impact  of  these
modalities on patients.
>

SUPPLEMENTAL  INFORMATION:  It  is  anticipated   that   the
protocol will be approved by an independent Data and  Safety
Monitoring  Board established by the NIDDK. It is  estimated
that  recruitment will begin January 2005. The  Collaborator
will  be expected to provide hemodialysis equipment  in  the
form  of dialyzers and its compatible tubing without  charge
and  in sufficient quantities for the expected duration  and
number of participants in the trial.
>

CAPABILITY  STATEMENTS: A selection committee  will  utilize
the  information  provided  in the “Collaborator  Capability
Statements”  received  in response to this  announcement  to
help  in its deliberations. It is the intention of the NIDDK
that  all  qualified Collaborators have the  opportunity  to
provide information to the selection committee through their
capability  statements.  The Capability  Statement  may  not
exceed  10  pages and should address the following selection
criteria:  the  statement  should provide  specific  details
about   the   product  to  be  supplied,  particularly   any
validation  of  its  use in a pediatric population,  and  in
obese  subjects,  if  relevant;  and  the  statement  should
include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide
sufficient quantities of the product in a timely manner  for
the  duration  of the study. The statement may also  include
outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator.
>

TERMS:   The  Collaborator will be  expected  to  execute  a
Clinical  Trial Agreement, an example of which can be  found
at  http://techdev.niddk.nih.gov/forms.htm. No funding  from
the government is available.
>

SUBMISSION  DATES: A written statement of interest  must  be
submitted   by  September  27,  2004  and  all  Collaborator
Capability  Statements  must be  submitted  by  October  12,

Once your computer is set-up, registration, and training are completed, invoices will be created and processed in WAWF-RA.  WAWF-RA is mandated by DoD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement clause 252.232-7003 "Electronic Submission of Payment Requests", dated March 2003, which is incorporated in this purchase order.  The following information will help you get started.
Setting Up Your Computer
To set up your computer go to https://wawf.eb.mil and select the hyperlink on the left-hand side of the page entitled “About WAWF-RA”.  An expanded list will appear.  Select "Setting Up Your Machine".  This page will list all computer, software, and security requirements.  All necessary programs can be downloaded from this page.  Your computer must be configured properly to use WAWF-RA.  Once your computer is set up you may proceed to the registration process.
Registration
For help with the registration process go to  to https://wawf.eb.mil and select the hyperlink "Help with registration for access to WAWF-RA" in the center of your screen.  On the next page go towards the bottom and select the hyperlink under the "Vendors" section.  Be sure to list an Electronic Business Point of Contact in the Central Contractor Registry.  This information must be current to process an invoice in WAWF-RA and can be updated by going to www.ccr.gov.  Once you are ready to register go to https://wawf.eb.mil and select the hyperlink "Self Register to use WAWF-RA (New users)*" then follow the directions.  Upon activation of your account, usually within 2 business days, you will receive notification via email.  Prior to logging on to WAWF-RA, users are strongly encouraged to complete the computer-based training. 
Training
Training can be accessed by going to http://www.wawftraining.com/.  Be sure that your computer meets the minimum requirements listed on this page.  Users must register prior to starting the training.  This registration is separate from the registration process for the WAWF-RA system.  Be aware that this computer-based training is made for all users of WAWF-RA, not just vendors, so be sure to focus on the vendor portion of the training.  Once training is completed users may begin to use the system. 
Invoice Processing
When creating an invoice be sure to select the "Invoice and Receiving Report Combo" document type, not the “Invoice” or “Invoice as 2 in 1 (Services Only)” type.  Once the proper document type is selected you will be asked to indicate the location for inspection and acceptance.  Both must be coded as “Destination”.  
THE FOLLOWING CODES WILL BE REQUIRED TO ROUTE YOUR INVOICES AND ADDITIONAL EMAILS CORRECTLY THROUGH WAWF.

1.	INTRODUCTION

1.1	TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) currently provides a web directory to locate healthcare providers by city, state, zip code, country, specialty and network preference.  As a result to provide the best services possible to the TMA customers, it has been determined to add a web-based proximity search tool with dynamic mapping and routing on the TMA Web site.

1.2	Proximity Searching is common geographic search functionality on the World Wide Web.  It consists of searching for physical places and geographical locations known as points of interest (POI).  The TMA POI would be individual TRICARE Standard Providers.  

1.3	The expected result is to maintain the current web site appearance and functionality along with the enhanced ability to find all TRICARE Standard Providers within a user defined distance, in miles from a given address, while identifying the closest TRICARE Standard Providers of the given address.  Response time in obtaining the POI information is a critical consideration.  Another expected result is to obtain maps and driving directions from the given address to the selected POI.

1.4	Search tool provider will host POI data.  There will be an initial requirement to geocode approximately 4 Million records.  After the initial transfer of data is geocoded, TMA will submit a daily transfer of new, deleted and updated TRICARE Standard Provider records that will require geocoding as defined in the General Work Requirements (see 4.4).  A sample of the data that will be exported to the proximity search tool provider is included as Attachment A to the quote package.

2.	CONTRACT OBJECTIVE

2.1	The objective of this contract is to obtain a proximity search tool accessible from the TMA website.  To have the proximity searching tool provider host the solution by providing the mapping data and maintaining the TRICARE Standard Provider location data on the tool provider server.  

3.	SCOPE OF CONTRACT
To provide users the ability to search for a specialized type of TRICARE Standard Provider within a specified radius of a designated address and obtain a map with narrative driving directions upon request. The contract is for a Base Period plus four one year option periods.

4.	GENERAL WORK REQUIREMENTS
4.1	The Contractor will be required to geocode the TRICARE Standard Provider.  
4.2	The Contractor shall have the initial data load geocoded within 10 business days of receipt.
4.3	TMA will provide daily TRICARE Standard Provider updates to the search tool provider.
4.4	The search tool provider shall have the daily updates geocoded and available within 1 business days of receipt.
4.5	Data shall be transported by the TMA approved File Transfer Protocol, (FTP), or by an approved industry standard transfer software method which has been approved in advance, in writing by the COR.  
4.6	The Contractor will fully host/support the search results.
4.7	Search results are to include the driving distance for each provider listed from the users address in addition to the Provider File data.  An option if requested by the user is a zoom-able map, and driving directions.
4.8	Data retrieval will include the ability to search by combinations of the following fields; specialty, zip code, address and network preference in addition to name.
4.9	The Contractor shall provide a test environment to test the TRICARE Standard Provider data in the search tool prior to going live and as required provide system updates.
4.10	The Contractor shall provide an automated method of approval for daily updates to TRICARE Standard Provider data.
4.11	TMA expects the application to go live December 2004
4.12	The TRICARE Standard Provider web address is http://www.TMA.osd.mil/standardprovider
4.13	No changes can be made to the TMA web page without prior written approval from the Contracting Officer or designee.  
4.14	Locator service must be available 97% of the scheduled up time per month.  Scheduled uptime must be 7 days a week and exceed 20 hours per day.
4.15	Notify the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) of scheduled and/or unscheduled downtime.

The six conceptual vehicles are defined as:  Subsonic Transport (ST)  Supersonic Aircraft (SSA)  Rotocraft (RC)  Extreme Short Takeoff and Landing (ESTOL)  Personal Air Vehicle (PAV)  Uninhabited Air Vehicle (UAV)  Deliverables:  Note on model sizes: The following sizes are based on sizing the various models to one another not by scale but by relative size. This creates models in the same set at difference scales, but avoids creating models that are undesirably large or small.  Large Models (2 sets required):  ST - 5' wing span, fuselage to scale  SSA - 5' fuselage length, wing to scale  RC - 4' fuselage length, wing to scale  ESTOL - 4' fuselage length, wing to scale  PAV - 3.5' fuselage length, wing to scale UAV - 5' wing span  Small models (4 sets required):  ST - 12" wing span, fuselage to scale  SSA - 12" fuselage length, wing to scale  RC - 10" fuselage length, wing to scale  ESTOL - 10" fuselage length, wing to scale  PAV - 9" fuselage length, wing to scale  UAV - 12" wing span  Stands:  Each model shall be mounted on a statically stable stand sufficient to support the weight of the model. The stand shall be designed in a manner to not distract from the model’s appearance. It is preferable to have the large stands created in a manner that allows for displaying from the floor or a standard height table.  Finish:  The models shall be finished with paint and decals to achieve a look typical of that reflected in the images. No detail on the interior of vehicles is expected. No landing gear is required. All vehicles shall follow the same exterior scheme, which will be selected by time of contract award.  Shipping Containers:  Each large model shall be delivered with its own shipping crate. A set of small models may be contained within one shipping crate. The crates shall be of a material sufficient to prevent damage to the models during standard shipping on commercial carriers.  The period of performance shall be 3 months from date of award.

Microstructural details in coated reinforced carbon-carbons and molybdenum-rhenium heatpipes shall be faithfully recorded.  Corrosion products and crack initiation sites in aging aircraft airframe components shall be suitably photomicrographed.  Metallographic images of, for example, surface thin films of anodized aluminum alloys are required to be accurately collected and processed in the polarization modes of circularly polarized light and circular differential interference contrast.  A rotating specimen stage, if available, would enable easier acquisition of regular differential interference contrast images and would be a desirable accessory in the inverted microscope system. The inverted light optical microscope system shall include an image capture capability.  The image capture capability shall include all relevant hardware and software, such as a digital camera and camera adapter, image acquisition board, image analysis software and a computer system, which can process a library of high resolution images.  The image capture capability shall include a simple utility for acquiring microscope magnification data from an included encoder in order to record an accurate micron bar on user-designated photomicrographs. The inverted light optical microscope system shall include stage micrometers, accessory lenses and all ancillary devices needed to satisfy system requirements. All components shall be new.  A vendor’s response shall be specific and detailed enough to allow evaluation of the proposed inverted light microscope system.  A vendor shall include relevant descriptive literature with the proposal.  A set of comprehensive user’s manuals shall be provided.  All components shall be covered by a comprehensive warranty.  Training (to include accessories) for users of the inverted light microscope system shall be provided at the end user’s site.

<DESC>The 12th Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB intends to award a contract for Engineering Labs for Youth, in accordance with FAR Part 6.302.   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 and 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice using Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being accepted and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number F4SVP2422201 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The SIC Code is 8299, the NAICS code is 611691, and the size standard is $6,000,000.00.  The requirement is for Engineering Labs for Youth. OVERVIEW:  The Family Member Program Youth Branch has a need to provide the school-age/youth centers with an engineering laboratory that teaches engineering, technology literacy skills, communications, problem solving, and team skills.  This equipment will ensure youth have the opportunity to develop higher level thinking skills to support AFI 24-249. INTRODUCTION:  Lab kits should include activities that offer hands-on projects in the following 8 subject areas.  These subject areas were specifically selected on the basis of developing problem solving and critical thinking skills across a broad spectrum of disciplines.  These subjects weave in a variety of relevant topics and skills critical to the development of technology literate students.  History, language arts, communications technology, and topics in applied math and science are all blended together in an interdisciplinary student experience.
·	Art - Creative Constructions- Students learn the basics in design techniques, color, and sculpture using common household materials
·	Physics - Mechanics- This tabletop science series addresses the forces of the physical world that surround us.  Topics include pendulums, simple machines, rotational inertia, conservation of momentum, force, gravity, and more.
·	Chess - Students begin with basic projects introducing how the pieces move.  As they develop their skills, they learn notation, advanced strategies, and can find partners to play on-line.
·	Internet - This series introduces students to the basics of webpage design starting from creating basic text pages to working up to interactive web layout and design.
·	LOGO Programming - This series provides an excellent introduction to programming concepts.  Developed through research at MIT, LOGO was specifically designed for children.  LOGO programming is also an excellent tool introducing and lending relevance to geometry and math concepts.
·	Mechanical Engineering with LEGO® or equal products - LEGO® materials are outstanding constructs for learning.  Significant gains in general technology literacy are accomplished through this series due to its emphasis on applied math and science, systems design, analysis, and troubleshooting.
·	Architecture with LEGO®or equal products - Few subject areas lend themselves to interdisciplinary studies better than Architecture.  Blending history, aesthetics, structural engineering, and functionality is an engaging and exciting way to learn.
·	Electricity - This series introduces students to the basics of electricity using common household materials such as aluminum foil, flashlight batteries, and lemons.  Students exploring this strand will find themselves learning about electrons, circuits, batteries, conductors, resistors and much more.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This procurement is being issued as a request for quotation.  Submit offers on RML-RFQ # 4056.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24–dated 06/18/04. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a Total Small Business
Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System(NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690 and the small business size is $6.0. The Rocky Mountain Laboratories,  Office of the Associate Director(OAD) is in need of Biosafety, Biocontainment and Biosecurity Review Services. After the events of September 11, 2001, and subsequent anthrax infections, President Bush tasked the National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases(NIAID) to increase its research into the development of safe and effective counter-measures to protect the public against emerging infections and the threat of biological agents that could be used for bioterrorism.  Towards achievement of the goals outlined in the NIAID Strategic Plan for Biodefense Research, the Division of Intramural Research(DIR), NIAID is required to construct and commission appropriate bio-containment facilities in the United States. An integral element of this priority initiative will be the development of procedures and processes to handle/monitor potentially lethal agents and to minimize the threat to the laboratory facility,
its clinical/research personnel, and the surrounding community. The research studies/programs at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories RML) are expanding to help develop new understanding, diagnostics, vaccines and treatments for infectious
diseases, with priority emphasis on those relevant to biodefense.  To assure that research is carried out safely for both the scientists and the community, a new Integrated Research
Facility (IRF) will be built on the RML campus.  A relatively small portion of the IRF will contain Biosafety Level (BSL) 4 aboratories, with the remaining space devoted to BSL-3 and BSL-2 laboratories, animal procedure and holding, offices and
conference rooms. Through the design phase of the RML IRF project, NIAID DIR has drawn upon the expertise and experience of BSL-4 scientists, facility managers and biosafety specialists. The engagement of these experts has led to a building design that
will be a “state-of-the art” facility, and serve as a model, world-wide, for future high biocontainment facilities. In addition, RML has an existing “state-of-the-art” BSL-3
biocontainment facility, Building 25. Building 25 houses several research laboratory suites, a BSL-3 vivarium, and associated support functions. Several agents studied in the
BSL-3 are on the Select Agent List. Building 25 will be linked to the IRF, and scientist access to Building 25 will be via the IRF.  SCHEDULE:  Integrated Research Facility: We are now at a crucial point in the process where we require the review and expertise of a Safety & Occupational Health Expert to develop the following:  1)Standard Operating Procedures for the IRF and associated Building 25 BSL-3 facility at RML; 2)Dedicated Biosafety Manual for the IRF and associated Building 25 BSL-3facility at RML; 3)Administrative tracking and monitoring procedures to insure compliance with regulations for work with select agents; 4)Training programs for the eventual management
and operations of these facilities.  Biosafety, Biocontainment and Biosecurity Review Services are required with the following requirements:  1)  Provide Project Oversight and
Review Services to evaluate bio-safety, bio-containment, and bio-security features for theRML IRF Facility: a) Evaluate construction, commissioning, operations and maintenance
plans, specifications and procedures as developed by architects, engineers and other specialists on the project team; b) Develop written review comments representing NIAID
DIR interests to other consultants, contractors, and federal staff involved with the project Delivery;  c) When working with RML-IRF project team staff, facilitate the resolution of
conflicts during the initial construction stages;  d)Attend a wide range of meetings related to the IRF Project.  2)  Coordinate and develop written Standard Operating Procedures
(SOP) for the RML IRF Facility based on established procedures and guidance defined
 by NIH organizations with jurisdictional authority.  When addressing building matters,
 base SOP development on the Modes of Operations developed for the RML IRF project
 by the project team.  The following organizational approach to the SOPs is suggested, but can be altered as needed: Overview of the SOPs within the context of the RML campus operations (administrative, security, laboratory, vivarium, waste, interface with other facilities, etc.) i)  IRF Facility Operations and Maintenance (laboratory and vivarium); ii)IRF Biosafety, Biocontainment and Biosecurity (laboratory and vivarium); iii)  IRF
 Protocol Specific (laboratory and vivarium) once researchers are identified. iv)  IRF Staff
 Security Clearance Process  v)  IRF Emergency Response. The following are minimum
 elements to be included within each SOP: 1)  Purpose for the  SOP; 2)  Responsible
 Parties; 3) Certifications required, if any, and the timing of those certifications; 4)
 Relevance of the SOP to other RML, NIH, DHHS, or federal requirements (radiation
 safety, security, legal, etc.); 5) Step-by-Step Process and related procedures with flow
 diagrams included when applicable; 6) Organizational oversight, monitoring, review and
 update processes for the SOP; 7) Relevant Documents required and location of those
 documents; 8) Any critical timing issues for implementation of the SOP. These SOPs
 need to be coordinated with the stipulations within the contract documents (drawings,
 specifications, commissioning, modes of operations, security and other contractual
 requirements) for the RML IRF project. Written verification of such coordination needs
 to accompany each segment of the SOP document.  3)     Develop staffing and financial
 projections for operating the RML IRF. These should be based on the SOP Overview
 stipulations as defined above or modified based on the discussion and needs that arise in
 working with the Office of the Associate Director (OAD) at RML.  In addition, confirm
 staffing levels against the planning projections stated in the Program of Requirements for
 the RML IRF.  a) Determine RML IRF facility staffing functions for maintenance, animal
 holding, biosafety and laboratory support.  Provide recommendations regarding the
 feasibility of recruiting federal workers versus contract support; b)Determine the number
 of staff needed to operate the facility as defined by the Overview for the SOPs. Determine
 the timeline and requirements needed to hire and orient staff based on precursor
 requirements (i.e. clearances, availability, training, etc.).  The primary staffing groups to
 be considered are listed as follows with added subsets of functional expertise for each as
 appropriate: i) Facility Maintenance;  ii) Biosafety;  iii) Security;  iv) Animal Holding
 including animal care functions;  v) Administrative; vi) Clerical Support.  c) Develop
 training programs for RML IRF staff to ensure proper orientation for facility operations
 and research:  i) Devise training programs for each of the functions and category of
 worker in accordance with SOP requirements.  ii).   Determine frequency of refresher
 training and specific “levels” of knowledge/expertise that many be required within the
 context of SOPs pertinent to that function. iii)   Define certification requirements needed
 and the manner in which to obtain them. iv)    Establish a training database used to
 monitor staffing expertise, training, and certifications. 4)      Provide review services
 to representatives of local/regional medical facilities considered as to assist with
 developing appropriate capacity for emergency purposes for agents studied in IRF.  The
 contractor shall develop a detailed plan for management of infections acquired in BSL-3
 and BSL-4 facilities.  The plan shall include requirements for facilities, equipment,
 supplies, staffing, and training necessary for a regional referral hospital to care for all

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation seeks quotes for NEW equipment only; the Government will not consider quotes for refurbished equipment.

The Solicitation Number is SB1341-04-Q-0941.  The solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-24.

THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING CONDUCTED ON A COMPETITIVE, UNRESTRICTED BASIS AMONG (A) ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS AND (B) AUTHORIZED RESELLERS.

The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) (see http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html) code for this solicitation is 334516, and the small business size standard for that NAICS code is 500 or fewer employees.

BACKGROUND ON THIS PROCUREMENT:

NIST requires a complete atomic force microscope (AFM) system for high-magnification imaging of biomaterials and living cells consists of an AFM scanner, electronic controller, and computer with image acquisition and analysis software integrated with functions for performing imaging of biological materials under controlled physiological conditions. These functions include a fluid-flow cell, an environmental chamber for maintaining gas pressure and mixtures of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, and a heating stage and controller for maintaining the sample temperature environment at 37 degrees Celsius.

<DESC>Response due date has been extended to 01 Sept 2004, 2PM Local Time

Additional Questions and Answers of 30 Aug 04. Six (6) additional questions:

1. Can the individual platforms be slightly different size than 10'x20'? We propose for material handling & shipping considerations using 16 sections 8'x20' for the platform and 15 pieces 8'x20' for the ramp. Specified 10'x20' individual platforms exceed the crane capabilities. Also, the proposed size would remove the need for a permit in shipping, lowering the freight cost significantly.
 Answer: Sections can be any size as long as dock can hold the required weight, and meets all other specifications.

2. Can the platforms be welded on site or are removable fasteners required?
 Answer: Removable fasteners only, this gives us the ability to move at a future date.

3. We understand that there are 7 hinge plates 88" wide. What should the length be or what will the maximum height difference between the platform and the K-Loader?
 Answer:10 each hinged bridge plates 50" long X 24 wide".  There is no maximum height difference with the k-loader.  The k-loader bed is adjustable from 39" to 222". 

4. A hinge ramp 88"x24" will weigh 456#. How do you anticipate repositioning the plate?
 Answer:Changed the dimensions of the bridge plates to 50" X 24". If you would like a picture of the bridge plate configuration please email/contract TSgt Romeo Reyes at romeo.reyes@dm.af.mil or 520-228-5484

5. Are we able to get a better copy of the existing ramp photograph?
 Answer:We do not have any pictures.

6. Is the platform necessary? Are you open to an adjustable height ramp which is more flexible, more portable and much less expensive?
 Answer:No.

<DESC>Questions (Q) and answers (A) regarding the solicitation and government requirements are provided below.  Nothing else is changed, and proposals are still due at the originally required date and time.
Q: 1.  Is it preferred to have DR stage on the central axis of symmetry or can it be out of central line?  A:  Either geometry for the DR stage is acceptable.
Q:  2.  Should three clear shot ports be evenly (120 degree) spread?  A: Even spacing is not required.
Q:  3.  Is there a shielded room present or planned for the project?  A:  No, a shielded room is neither present nor planned.
Q:  4.  Is a computer control of LS 370 AC bridge desirable/absolutely needed?  A:  Computer control is not absolutely needed.  The ability to add computer control, perhaps at a later time, is desirable.
Q:  5.  What is a cutoff frequency for customers low frequency lines filters desired?  A:  A cutoff frequency near 10 kHz is desirable.  The cutoff should definitely be below 100 kHz.  If the vendor would like to provide details of their proposed solution,  we can review them in more detail and provide comment.
Q:  6.  Can SS shields of the twisted pairs and micro-coaxes have multiple ground contacts inside IVC (on heat anchors), which is the normal practice? A:  Yes - multiple ground contacts are acceptable.
Q:  7.  What space should be reserved below MC flange?  A:  Two vertical dimensions are described in the solicitation.  First, the distance from the mixing chamber flange to the bottom of the 60 mK shield should be ~ 60 cm. Second, the distance from the bottom of the 60 mK shield to the bottom of the IVC shield should be ~ 30 cm.   A sketch showing these dimensions will be provided upon request  to the primary point of contact.
