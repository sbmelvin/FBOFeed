<CONTACT>Sharon Teger Contracting Officer 7037871263     Sharon.Teger@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior intends to competitively award a contract to provide MMS with the spatial and temporal analysis of overflooding on the landfast ice seaward of the Beaufort Sea coastal rivers between Smith Bay and Camden Bay and HEREBY SOLICITS CAPABILITY STATEMENTS (FAR Part 15.202 Advisory Multi-Step Process) from parties interested in proposing on this requirement.   PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY. The name of the new study is titled "Mapping Sea Ice Overflood using remote Sensing from Smith Bay to Camden Bay" PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to map and document the spatial and temporal extent of over flooding of the landfast ice in the Beaufort Sea from Smith Bay in the west to Camden Bay in the east.  The prime objective for this study shall be to improve MMS's knowledge of the extent that fresh water outflow from North Slope rivers overfloods the adjacent landfast zone during the late May and early June spring break-up period.  BACKGROUND: Detailed information on the spatial extent of overflooding does not exists for most of the North Slope coastal zone adjacent to the landfast ice. With the advent of development in the Beaufort Sea, this type of information is needed to address issues regarding pipeline routing and facility siting.  Analysis of overflood and its implications for exploration and development requires information on both the temporal and spatial distribution of ice overflood from the breakup of North Slope Rivers in the spring.  This study would provide baseline data and improve the accuracy of information for environmental assessment and hazard mitigation.  These observations would also be of value to the offshore industry for planning operations on the OCS.  MMS has limited spatial and temporal information on rivers overflooding the nearshore sea ice in spring.  Most of the collected data on overflooding is spatially constrained to area of overflooding seaward of the Sagavanirktok River and three years of overflood data for the Kuparuk River in the vicinity of Northstar Production Island.  In addition, Landsat imagery that provides overflood information has been collected by Stringer (1988, 1993) and archived at the University of Alaska Geophysical Institute for the Beaufort Sea. A soon to be completed study titled "Mapping and Characterization of Spring Leads and landfast Ice in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas" MMS OCS Study 2006-068, collected RADARSAT imagery and interpreted landfast ice extents from 1996 through 2004. The MMS anticipates awarding a cost-reimbursement contract with an estimated price of between $400,000 and $500,000.  The period of performance is three years (36 months).  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  SCOPE OF WORK: The Contractor shall be required to (Task a) Review and synthesize literature, local information, and data sources into a Procite Database for those studies that collected data on overflooding of the landfast ice for the North Slope of Alaska. The literature search may also include those pertinent studies done for the Canadian portion of the Beaufort Sea or other areas of the Arctic. (Task b) Produce a Field Plan that includes a Coordination and Permitting Flight Plan: The contractor shall submit a plan to MMS prior to going into the field that verifies acquisition of necessary State of Alaska, Federal, and local permits before flying the surveys.  The contractor shall have touched based with relevant authorities on the North Slope, Alaska to assure consideration of any special requirements (e.g., altitude limitations in wildlife areas etc..) or seasonal considerations such as subsistence hunting and fishing within the survey and transit areas of operation. The flight plan shall also address coordination with other entities, such as the North Slope Borough and proposed schedule of field work. The plan shall contain the proposed survey and transit maps showing the lines of the proposed survey effort, proposed dates linked to the lines, and any potential refueling stops or other scheduled landings.  They shall document the types of aircraft and heights of operation over the entire proposed survey area. The draft flight plan with all associated signed permits and stipulations shall be provided to MMS at least three months prior to going into the field so that MMS has an opportunity to provide comments and for the contractor to address any needed changes. The final flight plan is to be submitted to MMS one month prior to going into the field. The contractor will also provide a corporate safety plan for technical staff in the field during the operation of aircraft and any field work on the landfast ice. The contractor shall identify the type of equipment they propose to use to collect the necessary data, staffing levels and expertise. They shall identify the types of field measurements they propose to take for the purpose of identifying overflood extents from the satellite imagery. They shall also propose how they will collect the data sets and in which formats they would be provided as part of the field report.(Task c) Conduct a Helicopter and on Ice field Survey for One Season off the Colville River Delta to Ground Truth the Remote Sensing Imagery and Quantify Uncertainties of Estimating the Overflood  Extents from Remotely Sensed Imagery.  Interpret Overflood extents from Satellite Imagery for all North Slope Rivers for 2007 Field Season: The contractor shall employ a helicopter that can utilize precision GPS video photography or Geographic Information System (GIS) software to accurately map the overflooding events that occurs on the landfast ice seaward of the Colville River Delta during the spring breakup period of 2007.  In addition, on ice field measurements shall be collected for the purpose of assisting in the interpretation of the satellite imagery. The information from the video imagery, on ice field data measurements, and newly collected satellite imagery such as MODIS, RADARSAT and AVHRR will be integrated to accurately map the maximum spatial overflood extent seaward of the Colville River Delta during the 2007 spring breakup period. The results from the field effort shall be used to acquire additional satellite imagery so that the remaining overflood areas for those North Slope Rivers can be mapped for the 2007 spring break-up season. The helicopter shall use digital video imagery with GPS position control to collect data on the overflood extents for the landfast ice seaward of the Colville River Delta.  All imagery will be backed up in the event of data lose during the period of collection. The data will be captured and stored within an ARCGIS database.  The helicopter will also be used to transport field personnel out onto the ice before and during the breakup period to collect on ice field measurements.   The field measurements shall be collected along transects from the inner to the outer overflood apron. The field measurements may include water depth, water temperature, salinity, measurements of albedo, ice cores and other appropriate data that would be useful for interpreting the satellite imageries response to the ice properties and surrounding environmental conditions during spring break-up. After the field data collection is complete, the contractor shall collect all of the appropriate satellite imagery for the landfast ice zone seaward of the Colville River Delta, process the imagery with the appropriate algorithms based upon the field measurements, then determine the maximum extent of overflooding using a combination of satellite imagery and field data for the 2007 field study area of investigation. After all of the data for the field area is evaluated, the contractor shall acquire the appropriate combination of satellite imagery for the remaining overflood areas that are seaward of the North Slope Rivers from Smith Bay to Camden Bay for 2007 break-up period. The contractor shall interpret the maximum overflood extents from the satellite imagery for all of the North Slope between Smith and Camden Bay for the 2007 spring break-up season. All of the data will be incorporated into an ARCGIS Geodatabase with complete metadata. The critical aspect of this task is to collect sufficient field data in order to develop algorithms as needed for use in the calibration of the satellite imagery. The contractor shall provide a field report that describes the scientific approach used to correlate the maximum overflood extent obtained from the field measurements and the satellite imagery. The contractor will identify a number of different examples in the report under this Task that demonstrate the correlation between the satellite imagery and the field data. The contractor will also describe the results from other North Slope Rivers when integrating the information to other areas that had not been field tested. From the basis of the field correlation, the contractor will locate and archive the appropriate historical imagery that shall be used to interpret the overflood extents for the years 1995-2006. The imagery will be collected under (Task d) Collect and Synthesize existing High-Resolution Satellite Imagery which can be used to Interpret the Maximum Spatial Extent of Overflooding for the Landfast Ice Zone Adjacent to North Slope Rivers between Smith Bay and Camden Bay. Based upon the field and satellite information collected and interpreted from Task c, the contractor shall synthesize any combination of the appropriate high-resolution imagery (MODIS, RADARSAT, AVHRR, LANDSAT) from 1995 through 2006 (note that overflood extents have been mapped for the 2007 season under task c) which can be used to map the maximum extent of over flooding on the landfast ice during spring break-up offshore of the North Slope rivers. All of the imagery must be catalogued in a database by year, month, day, time, type of imagery, and image resolution. (Task e) Map and Document the Maximum Spatial and Temporal Extents of North Slope River Overflooding along the North Slope of Alaska from Smith Bay to Camden Bay for the Period 1995-2007. The contractor shall determine the maximum extent of overflooding from the North Slope Rivers for the years 1995-2007 and calculate the variability in maximum spatial extent between years for all studied rivers. In addition, the contractor shall interpret the range in variability in overflood extent for all rivers and compare over flooding extent to one or more of the following readily available variables: river discharge, surface temperature, rainfall, storm occurrence, snow cover, oil and gas operations (e.g., ice roads that may extend out from shore), or other potential factors that may control its yearly spatial variability.  The interpreted spatial and temporal data for the overflooding extents and statistics will be incorporated into an ARCGIS Geodatabase under (Task f) Create a Geographic Information System (GIS) Database of the Spatial Distribution of River Overflooding along the Beaufort Sea Coast, Alaska. The contractor shall build a Geographic Information System (GIS) Geodatabase that contains all of the spatial, temporal and statistical output from the collection of field data, analysis of imagery, and statistical analysis.  Prior to loading the final data, the contractor will submit a proposed database plan for supporting the inclusion of all data sets, including interpreted imagery, video and statistical analysis. The contractor will also propose simple queries that can be added as DLL's to ARCGIS. The queries shall be used by MMS to query and display the overflood extents and corresponding satellite imagery. The database shall also include complete database documentation and metadata. (Task g) Produce a Monthly Progress Report, Final Report, Technical Summary and NTIS Documentation: The contractor will provide a detailed progress report to the COTR on a monthly basis. The contractor shall also produce a draft and a final report that describes the full scope of the study effort including any data analysis. A draft copy of the study shall be provided to MMS in MS Word document format compatible with MMS software.  The final report shall be provided to MMS in pdf format after MMS comments have been incorporated. The study background portion of the report shall include a summary of the findings from any previous studies and field work.  The methods section shall describe the field study and the methods used to collect the field data and to correlate the field measurements to the satellite imagery. The methods section shall also include the methodology used to develop any new algorithms, interpret the satellite imagery, and complete the comparative statistical analysis.  This section shall also include images and detailed coastline maps with bathymetry that display the reference points where over flood data had been collected. The discussion portion of the report shall include the results from the data analysis with maps, graphs, and tables. Project Deliverables: (Task a) Procite Database with citations from literature and field studies. (Task b) Colville River Delta Field Plan with maps, proposed flight lines, and timing of survey, required permits, proposed areas that will be covered, proposed on ice field data collection effort and justification for such effort. (Task c) Post Colville River Delta Field Season Data Submittal and Report: ARCGIS Geodatabase: that contains the on ice field measurements, video imagery displaying the overflooding during the break-up season, satellite imagery, and interpreted overflood extents for the 2007 field season.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA intends to award a contract to AgResearch, Ruakura Research Centre, East Street, Private Bag 3123 Hamilton, New Zealand under the authority FAR 6.302-1 through solicitation EA133C-06-RQ- 0304.  Only one responsible source is available to satisfy the agency requirement for Brevetoxin Analytical Reagents.
(15 each - Sepharose anti-brevetoxin immunoaffinity first production columns; 2 each - Immunoaffinity column method and analysis for urine and liver; 50 each - Sepharose anti-brevetoxin immunoaffinity bulk production columns ; 1 ml - Protein G purified sheep anti-brevetoxin antiserum; 1 ml - Brevetoxin affinity purified anti-brevetoxin antiserum; 4 250 ug - Brevetoxin-cysteine conjugate reference material (m/z 1018)>95% purity; 4 250 ug – Brevetoxin-cysteine sulfoxide conjugate reference material (m/z 1034)>95% purity.) Brevetoxins are produced by Florida Red tides and are responsible for yearly mortality events of marine animals.  The primary brevetoxin produced by red tide algae, brevetoxin-2 is rapidly metabolized and is most commonly found as conjugates that appear to retain toxic potency.  AgResearch Science has produced antibodies to brevetoxin which have been the sole immunological reagents used by NOAA for detection of brevetoxins in marine and laboratories animal species.  Studies published by NOAA have determined that this antiserum detects the major toxin metabolites in mammals.  Additionally, AgResearch has developed a proprietary method to produce brevetoxin conjugate reference materials.  The antiserum developed by AgResearch Science has been determined to be effective in the long term detection of brevetoxins in blood and animal tissues.  This research has been published in two peer reviewed articles authored by NOAA: Environmental Health Perspectives 111:1595-1600 (2003) ibid 113:11-16 (2004).  The presence of the brevetoxin-cysteine conjugate (m/z 1018) and brevetoxin-cysteine sulfoxide conjugate (m/z 1034) have been determined to be the primary metabolites in the urine of animals treated with brevetoxins.  This research has been published by NOAA: in. Toxicological Sciences, 85:839-846 (2005).  NOAA has confirmed that no synthetic approaches have been reported for the brevetoxin conjugates through the Association for Official Analytical Chemists Task team on Marine Toxins, an internationally recognized assemblage of marine toxin chemists. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  All information received by 4:00 p.m., EST, 04/03/06 will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Michele.A. McCoy@noaa.gov.  See Note 22.

<DESC>This is a Presolicitation notice.  Provide all labor, material, supervision, equipment, and tools necessary to perform general repairs and alterations (mostly interior) to Federally-owned and leased buildings within the five (5) boroughs of New York City, and in the New York State counties of Nassau, Suffolk, and Westchester.  This is a multiple-award, Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts solicitation, and the offeror shall have the ability to perform construction projects (on an as-needed basis) ranging in dollar value from $2,000.00 to $2,470,000.00 (the GSA Prospectus Level).  The offeror may also be required to furnish design (architect & engineer) services on certain projects.  The offeror will be required to serve as the General Contractor and will therefore be responsible for the work of all trades involved on the projects.  The estimated cost of construction under these contracts is approximately $1.1 million per year, however up to $5 million in projects may be awarded each year.  This procurement will be a total small business set aside.  To be considered a small business, the concern’s average annual receipts for the preceding three (3) fiscal years may not exceed $31 million (under NAICS 236220).  There will, in addition, be partial set asides (a) to service-disabled, veteran-owned small business concerns, (b) to HUBZone small business concerns, and (c) to 8(a) concerns.  The Government intends to make multiple awards (anticipate seven (7) contracts) under the subject solicitation.  Three (3) of the contracts will fall under the partial set-aside portion, and one award, therefore, may be reserved for a qualified service-disabled, veteran-owned small business concern; one award may be reserved for a qualified HUBZone small business concern; and one award may be reserved for a qualified 8(a) concern.  All small business concerns will be eligible to bid on the non-set aside portion (anticipate four (4) contract awards).  The sealed-bid method of procurement will be used.  Awards will be made to the responsible bidders (see Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 9.1) whose bid is responsive to the terms of the invitation for bids and is most advantageous to the Government, considering only price and the price related factors included in the invitation.  Individual Task Orders exceeding $2,000.00 will be competed amongst the contract awardees unless the Government deems otherwise on an individual Task Order basis.  Non-price evaluation factors (e.g., past performance) may be considered in addition to price in determining the placement of Orders.  The contracts will be for a one-year Base Period with four (4) one-year Options to be exercised at the Government’s discretion.  The contracts are expected to commence on September 1, 2006.  There will be a Guaranteed Minimum quantity of work the Government agrees to order from each contractor.  This amount will be predicated on the division of $100,000.00 per year by the total number of contracts awarded (e.g., if there are five (5) total awardees, the figure will be $20,000.00 per contractor).  The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220.  Firms interested in receiving a complete solicitation (bid) package please send a written request, no later than the close of business on Tuesday, March 28, 2006, to the attention of: Mr. Jonathan Phillips, Contracting Officer, General Services Administration, Federal Center Service Center (2PMC-F), 26 Federal Plaza, Room 16-124, New York, NY 10278 or by facsimile to (212) 264-4808.  Please no phone or e-mail requests.  The solicitation will be available on or about April 20, 2006.  There will be a public opening of bids anticipated on or about May 24, 2006.  ATTENTION PROSPECTIVE SUBCONTRACTORS:  If you are interested in serving as a potential subcontractor to the General Contractors bidding on this solicitation and you wish to have your company information included in the solicitation, for marketing purposes, please submit your company name, address, phone number, contact person, and area(s) of specialization (e.g., electrical, carpentry, plumbing) by electronic mail to scott.starkman@gsa.gov (type “Subcontractor Info” as the Subject) by close of business on Tuesday, March 28, 2006.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting synopses and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. The Navy has a requirement for the re-life of NAE Beacon MK 3 Mod 2 Devices.   This requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis with Allied Logistics Incorporated, 2568 Channel Drive, Ventura, CA 93003, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Government has a need to increase the inventory of the MK 3 MOD 2 NAE Beacon.  Government studies have been conducted to determine the feasibility of replacing the life limiting components, mainly polymers, in expired assets to re-life them.  The process requires handling Lithium Hydride in a granular form which carries certain facility requirements and is governed by state and local laws.  Units provided as Government Furnished Equipment will be Fleet returns due to expiration and will be inspected initially by the contractor to determine their eligibility for re-life operations.  Once it is determined that a unit is eligible, the Flo!  atation Assembly and all o-ring will be replaced with new components.  Allied Logistics currently possesses the necessary facilities and equipment to safely and consistently perform the necessary operations to ensure quality units are returned to the Fleet.  The action will result in a Firm Fixed price IDIQ type contract with a 5-year ordering period.  It is anticipated that the minimum quantity to be ordered will be 300 units and the maximum will be 1500 units.  See Notes 22 and 26.  Questions should be directed to Ms. Cynthia Young at telephone 812-854-2433, fax 812-854-4848, or e-mail cynthia.c.young@navy.mil   (preferred method).

<CONTACT>April Irby 850-636-6035 , or Contracting Officer Mary Hines at 850-235-5389.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL intends to award a sole source indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity contract to EDO Corporation, New York City, NY for engineering support services to develop a Very Shallow Water Mine Neutralization (VSW-MN) system based on a non-developmental (military off-the-shelf) neutralizer already deployed with the Fleet.  The period of performance will be for five years from the date of award. This requirement is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reason:  This effort is being initiated as a result of a Defense Acquisition Challenge Program (DACP) proposal from EDO submitted to the DoD Comparative Testing Office (CTO) under Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) HQ0034-06-BAA-0001-DAC.  The U.S. Navy has evaluated the proposal and determined that it has merit for funding.  EDO is the U.S. original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for the AN/ASQ-232 MNS.  The heart of this system, the SEAFOX neutralizer vehicle!   and the console were originally developed by the German firm ATLAS ELEKTRONIK (ATLAS) as a subcontractor to Lockheed Martin Corporation under NAVSEA contract N00024-99-9-6311.  As demonstrated by ATLAS ELEKTRONIK letter of 20 September 2005, ATLAS has negotiated an exclusive agreement with EDO to provide the essential customer interface, liaison and support to transition ATLAS technologies through subcontracts and licensing agreements.  Thus, EDO is the only source in the U.S. that can provide direct access to those AN/ASQ-232 technologies required to successfully develop a VSW-MN capability.  EDO is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering support to accomplish this tasking. There are no other sources with the capability to satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, schedule and technical risk to the Government. Award will be made based on re!  sponsive quote on or about 20 Jul 06.  NAICS 541330, SBA Size Standard : $4M, FSC: 8711

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA intends to procure on an other than full and open competition for H-1 Mission Planning Environment prototype in the Navy-Portable Flight Planning System (N-PFPS).  N-PFPS software uses an implementation of the client/server data model to provide a shared view of the mission route to software components.  This allows the operator to perform multiple operations on the same route without reentering data.  N-PFPS also displays standard digital maps, produces user-customizable kneeboard cards, provides combat mission folders, and interfaces to Digital Transfer Devices (DTD) for mission data transfer.  Mission file data is transferred to the aircraft through the use of the AWE for N-PFPS.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Any firms believing that they can provide this material may submit a written !  response to be received at the Contracting Office no later than 5 days after the date of publication of this notice, clearly showing its ability to do so without compromising the quality, accuracy, and reliability of the data or without causing programmatic hardship to the program.

<DESC>The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement to continue specialized scientific support services to the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS).  This support includes but is not limited to the following:  Scientific programming and analysis in support of specific GISS research programs and performing computer facility operations, systems programming, technical library operations, and overall logistical support for the GISS research facility. The scientific programming and analysis functions are integral parts of the respective research programs, whereas the other support functions are required to maintain and operate the facilities used in performing the said research. NASA GSFC intends to increase the current contract value under Contract NAS5-00170 to meet critical milestones until a follow-on performance-based contract is awarded after an 8(a) set-aside competitive process.  At this time, it is anticipated that the current GISS requirement will only be extended through July 2006.  The increase in the contract value is required to ensure uninterrupted support and to meet critical requirements until the follow-on competitive contract is awarded   SGT. Inc. must continue to supporting the following critical requirements:  1) Complete analyses of transient simulations performed with Model III for the period, 1880-2100, performance of additional simulations for that period, and further development of modifications to the climate model codes to improve model computing speed with the use of multiple processors.  Should this effort be interrupted by a break in support and service under the contract, GISS would be unable to meet its commitment for the primary target question for long-term climate under the NASA Science Implementation Plan, namely, “To what extent can long-term climate trends be assessed or predicted?”, and thus, NASA would not fulfill its objective regarding this question for the Climate Change Science Program (CCSP).  2) Perform operational production of International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) data products.	GISS is the single, global processing center for ISCCP data products, so disruption of this effort by a break in support and service under the contract would mean that NASA would be unable to meet its commitment to this international program which has been building and maintaining a global cloud climatology data set for the past 22 years. 3) Continued generation of the GISS global surface air temperature time series.  This widely used global surface air temperature time series is a key data set required in conjunction with the global climate models to ascertain the anthropogenic portion of global warming.  Were this data production to be interrupted by a break in support and service under the contract, GISS would be unable to meet its commitment for this aspect of the NASA science objectives for long-term climate analysis.  4) Analyze photopolarimetry observations from the Research Scanning Polarimeter aircraft campaigns to develop appropriate algorithms for retrieval of cloud properties to be used for the Aerosol Polarimetry Sensor on the NASA Glory Mission.  Failure to perform this work owing to a potential break in support and service under the contract would mean that the GISS science team that supports the Glory Mission would be unable to meet its commitment for algorithm development on schedule for the Glory Mission. This procurement action is being conducted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source.  SGT possesses the unique and specialized experience necessary to support the critical requirements until the follow-on contracts are awarded. SGT is the only company with the capability to provide the technical support without a reduction in service.  Any other contractor would be required to (1) train people in the operational procedures established for the generation of these specialized products; 2) Learn the GISS global climate atmospheric and ocean models and atmospheric analysis systems (containing hundreds of thousands lines of code) to a sufficient technical level to be able to make modifications to the code as a result of tuning and/or validation runs; and 3) hire an adequate number of staff from the limited pool of specialized scientists who have experience in the development and evaluation of models and in the use of satellite data streams to meet all the milestones listed above.  In addition, it is not practical or cost effective to conduct an 8(a) set-aside competition for up to 6 months of support as a precursor to the award of the follow-on contract. To compete a contract for only 6 months introduces risks to the completion of critical requirements to support GISS.	The phase-in time and lead-time for new contractor personnel to become minimally experienced and functional to meet the government requirements will result in unacceptable delays to the milestone schedules. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 27, 2006.  Interested organizations must provide documentation which establishes its capability in the required areas including documentation of past relevant experience.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A competition basis, based up responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

Tel: (502) 2476-0681, Fax: (502) 2476-3175.  National Energy and Mining GIS Project. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to carry out technical assistance for the development national energy and mining Geographical and Information System (GIS) system for Guatemala’s Ministry of Energy and Mines, Ministerio de Energía y Minas (MEM). 

The objective of this Technical Assistance is to develop a national GIS and associated Information Technology (IT) solutions to improve the licensing approval process for extracting natural resources in Guatemala (such as oil, gas, and minerals) and to decrease the negative impacts created by illegal fuel smuggling and alteration activities in Guatemala.  The technical assistance will help MEM to more efficiently monitor petroleum, natural gas, and mineral resource exploration and development programs, generate modern and more comprehensive data packages to better attract foreign investment in mineral exploitation, and enable the exchange of essential data between government agencies.  Moreover, the GIS project would improve MEM’s decision-making capability on the licensing of hydrocarbon and mineral concessions, as well as more effectively track compliance of the fiscal terms of operators’ production sharing contracts and other agreements for the extraction and sales of hydrocarbon and mineral resources.

The Technical Assistance will strengthen MEM’s regulatory, oversight, and compliance mission, as well as ensure that non-competitive practices (such as fuel smuggling, energy theft, and fuel alteration) are eliminated.  The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala strongly supports this technical assistance. Implementation of this GIS system is designed to improve the business climate for domestic and foreign investments in the Guatemalan energy and mining sectors, as the U.S. and Guatemala are poised for the CAFTA-DR (Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement) to enter into force.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $454,440 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit one (1) English version and one copy and one (1) Spanish version and three (3) copies of their Proposal directly to the Grantee by 12:00 p.m. local time, April 26, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

OTS was faced with the problem of how to enforce the least-privilege security model. ApplicationSecurity uses Microsoft Group Policy (GP) to provide the user with the least privileges needed to perform their jobs.
DesktopStandard was found to have the most complete suite of GP tools available to meet OTS’ desktop standardization, configuration management of GP changes and GP based software updates.  General GP training specific to DesktopStandard standard products is also an integral part of this consolidated approach to least privilege. The period of performance is April 10, 2006 through August 31, 2006. The OTS intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotations. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all quotations received with pricing and sufficient technical documentation to establish a bonafide capacity to meet the requirement received by 2:00PM EST, March 16, 2006 will be considered by the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling, and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document is available. Such information, if submitted, should be emailed Sharon.Doerk@ots.treas.gov. QUESTIONS MUST ALSO BE SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL.  TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  If this procurement is competed, no additional synopsis will be published and a request for quotation will only be forwarded to the intended vendor and firms that respond to this synopsis of intent

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisitions Center (COAC) for the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), intends to negotiate an award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Rigaku/ MSC Inc., 9009 New Trails Drive, The Woodlands, TX 77381, to provide a preventative maintenance and repair service agreement for government owned equipment: Model RAXIS IV++: XD-X001N / RU200: 007849 / CONFOCAL OPTIC /Crystal.

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that the equipment's manufacturer is the only know source with the capability of performing maintenance and repair service that will not invalidate the warranty and able to provide compatible replacement parts or accessories.   An award to any other source for the items would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 811219, Size Standard $6 million.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties are requested to review the above requirements, and submit a statement of interest which includes; a firm fixed price; documentation of the capabilities of meeting the Government's requirements;  at least three (3) references documenting successful past performance in meeting the Government's minimum specifications; and a proposed service plan.

Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK FOR SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION OF SERVICES PURCHASE ORDER FROM THE CONFEDERATED SALISH AND KOOTENAI TRIBES OF THE FLATHEAD RESERVATION (TRIBES) FY06 HISTORIC PROPERTIES MANAGEMENTAT THE LIBBY DAM/LAKE KOOCANUSA PROJECT, LIBBY, MONTANA 1.0  Background and Introduction.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) was authorized to build the Libby Dam  Lake Koocanusa (Project) in 1950 and construction was completed in 1972.  The Seattle District operates the Project for the multiple purpose s of power generation, navigation, recreation, flood control, and fish and wildlife conservation.  The Project is one of 14 within the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS).  The dam is on the Kootenai River, in Lincoln County, Montana and the Koocan usa reservoir extends for 90 miles (roughly half of which is in Canada).  Excepting approximately 1,500 acres of fee title real estate at the dam and downstream areas, the majority of project lands are within Lake Koocanusa and administered by the Kootenai  National Forest, U.S. Forest Service (KNF).  The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) markets the power generated by the Project.  Agencies of the Federal Government, including the Corps and BPA in this instance, are responsible for addressing the effects, or potential effects, of their activities and programs on cultural resources.    The FCRPS Cultural Resources Program addresses ef fects from system operations on historic properties in accordance with a variety of laws, regulations, executive orders, guidelines, and management and funding agreements between the Corps and BPA .  BPA contributes a portion of the funding in order to add ress shared cultural resources compliance responsibilities.     Since 1994, a Cultural Resources Cooperating Group (CG) comprising federal, state, and tribal government representatives has met to identify scope, review, prioritize, and conduct compliance work at the Project.   In cooperation with the CG, the Corps and BPA prepare annual and five-year Actions Plans that set forth a program for stewardship actions for historic properties affected by the Project and has established FY06 priorities.  Some of these priorities include 1) evaluation of the Bristow Creek Site C omplex (approximately 30 sites of the 400+ sites at the Project) for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) per Criteria A, B, and C, 2) development of 25LN1054 (Bristow Site) Phase I Mitigation Scoping Plan, 3) development of site 25LN 580 (Barron Creek) Stabilization plan, and 3) the completion of the Site Protection Plan for the mixed historic/prehistoric site at the abandoned Jennings Town Site (24LN1020/24LN1025H).   It is proposed that the evaluation of the Bristow Creek Complex und er Criteria A, B, and C be considered a Base Award.  In addition to the Base, there will be three options available for selection by the Government representing the three remaining priority tasks as Government Option 1 (Bristow Scoping Phase I), Government  Option 2 (Barron Site Stabilization), and Government Option 3 (Jennings Site Protection Plan).    2.0  Purpose. The purpose of this purchase order is to provide a means for the Government to access information about Project lands that are within the traditional territory and ceded lands of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Res ervation (CSKT) (see justification for other than full and open competition).  This type of linguistic and oral history information from traditional oral historians is necessary to meet Project compliance requirements.   The Base consists of evaluation of the Bristow Creek Site Complex (approximately 30 sites) for traditional tribal values under NHRP Criteria A, B, and C.   Archaeological sites affected by the Project have been evaluated under Criterion D of the NRHP.  The  CG has identified the lack of evaluation under Criteria A, B, and C as a long standing omission that requires attention in FY06 focusing on the B ristow Creek Site Complex, with continuing work at other sites and site complexes in FY07 and FY08 if the funding is available.  Without the evaluation under these criteria based on knowledge unique to the Tribes addressed in the Base, the Government will not have the information to effectively manage historic properties affected by the Project.    Government Option 1 consists of Tribal input to the 24LN1054 Phase I Mitigation Plan.   In 1987, the Kootenai National Forest secured funding to begin mitigation in the form of data recovery on the Bristow Creek site 24LN1054.  The site was one of three si tes recommended data recovery in the 1984 Koocanusa report (Thoms 1984).  This site has the highest density and diversity of artifacts of all sites in the project area.  Thus, site 24LN1054 has tremendous potential for yielding information identified as da ta gaps.  Conversely, the Tribes position is that it is time to prioritize measures other than excavation at 24LN1054 to mitigate losses from the Project, measures such as site protection, stabilization, and programs that bring something of value back to the Tribal community such as off site mitigation.  At the very least, excavation should not be undertaken without consideration of the impacts of those activities on Tribal traditional values and the cultural integrity of the site under criteria A, B, and C of the National Register.  Tribal input is critical to the development of a satisfactory Mitigation Plan that will meet the compliance requirements of the Project.   Government Option 2 consists of Tribal input to the Barron Creek Site (24LN580) Site Stabilization Plan.  The Barron Creek Site is eroding due to wind and wave action at the margin of the reservoir.  A preliminary assessment by Corps Civil Soils Branch has  recently been completed.  It identifies options for stabilizing the site.  Tribal input via evaluation of the site under Criteria A, B, and C is critical to the development of a satisfactory Stabilization Plan that will meet the compliance requirements of  the Project. Government Option 3 consists of Tribal input to the Jennings Town Site (24LN1020/24LN1025H) Site Protection Plan.  The site is a mixed prehistoric and historic property.  This site has been evaluated under NRHP Criterion D but has not been assessed for tra ditional Tribal values under Criteria A, B, and C.  This evaluation is critical to the development of a satisfactory Site Protection Plan.   3.0  General Statement of Tribal Services. The Tribes will furnish professional, non-personal cultural resources management services based on unique knowledge held by tribal elders to assist the Corps in developing its management plan for the three histori c properties.  This effort will include archival research, on- and off-site elder interviews, audio/video documentation of these interviews, transcription of interviews and entering of data into project database, preparation of written summary and recommen dations.  It is anticipated that these deliverables will involve the efforts of Tribal Historic Preservation Office (TPO) staff (including Tribal Historic Preservation Officer), Elders Advisory Committee, Kootenai Culture Committee, and Legal Counsel.  Tribes shall furnish sufficient technical, supervisory, and administrative personnel to insure prosecution of work in accordance with the progress schedule. Tribes shall keep the Corps Technical Point of Contact (David Grant, Staff Archaeologist, 206-764-4 466, david.m.grant@usace.army.mil) fully advised at all times concerning delays or difficulties which may prohibit completion of any part or whole of work by these established dates.  The Technical POC may adjust the following schedule in writing for mater ial delays on the part of the Government and for conditions beyond the control of parties hereto.  Primary point of contact at the Tribes is David Schwab, Contract Program Manager, (406-675-2700 x1080 or 406-275-2735, daves@cskt.org). 3.1  Base  Services. Conduct research of existing archival and traditional sources on traditional land use of the Bristow Creek Site Complex.  Review and compile existing correspondence in tribal and Montana State Historic Preservation Office archives.  Conduct inte rviews of traditional oral historians and document via appropriate media such as video/audio tapes, film or digital photographs, and written transcripts.  Effort shall include on-site visits by TPO personnel, Elders, and other community informants to deter mine the environmental and cultural context, identify traditional cultural areas, and to assess project effects on such properties and appropriate documentation and mapping of traditional cultural areas via GPS/GIS.  The recommendations for the determinati ons of eligibility under Criteria A, B, and C must meet the requirements of 36 CFR 60.4.  Specifically, they must be sufficiently detailed to allow the land manager and Montana SHPO to consult on and concur with the determination of eligibility while maint aining the confidentiality of culturally sensitive proprietary tribal information.   3.2  Option 1 Services.  Based on findings of identification and assessment effort completed in the Base Award, assist CG in formulation of culturally sensitive mitigation measures to address Project effects to Bristow Creek Site Complex and associated TCP (s).  In addition to the work conducted in the Base Award, Tribes shall conduct a file review of prior compliance activities at 24LN1054 (including records at the Montana SHPO in Helena) between 1984 and 2006.   3.3  Option 2 Services.  Conduct TPO/Kootenai Elders/community on-site visit to determine the environmental and cultural context of the Barron Creek Site and complete archival review and interviews with knowledgeable informants.  Based on the collected dat a, provide written recommendations to Corps and CG in support of development of Site Stabilization Plan. 3.4  Option 3 Services.  Conduct TPO/Kootenai Elders/community on-site visit to determine the environmental and cultural context of the Jennings Site and complete archival review and interviews with knowledgeable informants.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured and an award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The office of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) located in Seattle, WA intends to award a contract for Developing a PIT-TAG Detection System to Provide Straying Estimates for Columbia River Tributaries.

Background
National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has a project that is investigating the feasibility of developing a PIT-tag detection system to provide straying estimates within a Columbia River tributary identified as having high straying rates for ESA-listed salmonid stocks.  PIT tags have been used for over 20 years to permanently identify individual fish.  Through research and testing PIT-tag technology has been shown to be a reliable and effective method of identification and monitoring.  PIT-tag technology has evolved to the point in which multiple antennas can be installed to cover streams with 50’ widths.  In 2006, Digital Angel will begin to manufacture an improved tag model, which will enable us to design larger antennas that hopefully will allow us to develop a PIT-tag system that can cover the larger river widths needed for this project. 

Tasks


1. Conduct surveys of selected tributaries to identify potential locations for installing PIT-tag detection systems.  This task will include reviewing topographical maps, interviewing landowners, and determining the amount of recreational use.  An important criterion for the selection will be finding landowners willing to have the land-based equipment installed on their property.  
2. Conduct electromagnetic interference (EMI) monitoring using Digital Angel transceivers of one or two potential locations identified by the above survey.  This involves setting up test antennas with a transceiver and recording levels of EMI over 2 weeks.  The data then need to be analyzed to determine if there are acceptable levels.   
3. Obtain necessary permits for installing the PIT-tag antenna arrays into the selected tributary.  Paperwork needs to be filled out to obtain the required state and federal permits for installing structures into navigable waterways.  Depending on the selected site, permits might also be needed for installing the land-based equipment.  
4. Work with NMFS to design and test larger antennas in the laboratory.  The scale of the candidate tributaries dictates that antenna research and development will be a primary component of the project.  As the antennas get larger, structural issues are as important as electronic ones.  For example, we anticipate needing antennas that are designed to minimize their impact on boat navigation.  
 The period of performance is April 2006 through March 2007. This notice may represent the only official notice. This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000.  All responsive and responsible bids may be submitted. Request the,  Requisition for Quotations in writing to melvin.n.fondue@noaa.gov.

<ARCHDATE>03142007
<CONTACT>SONJA TWETEN  CONTRACT SPECIALIST  3032369335     sctweten@usgs.gov;
<DESC>This letter is in response to questions concerning solicitation 06CRSS0022, Gas Hydrate Analysis. 1.)	Due to the highly variable nature of seismic data quality, previous work flows may not work on data significantly different than that of the data used to develop the USGS work flow.  In light of this, is there any way that bidders can view a small subset of the seismic data for the project to aid in their bidding?   Data is sufficiently described in the statement of work.  2.)	Does the USGS already have the log curve data on hand that would be loaded into this project?  If so, what types of log curves are typically available for this work?  In particular, how many wells with sonic log curves are available that would tie the 3D data mentioned in the bid package? To date, the USGS has available logs from approximately 70 wells within the area of interest associated with the proposed project areas. Most of the 70 wells have associated sonic log curves. 3.)	Will there be technical assistance during the course of this project, and will it be able to provide assistance in performing any calculations of resistivity to sonic velocity within the permafrost interval and assist with the saturation and thickness calculations from thin bed hydrate analysis for the investigations? USGS personnel will be available throughout the contract interval to provide technical expertise in the conversion of resistivity logs to sonic logs in areas of poor hole quality and problematic intervals within the permafrost zone. 4.)	The bid document has several references to "USGS project interpreters".  How many man hours will be provided by the USGS internally and what will be their role in the project?  Will they be under the guidance of the successful bidder?   There will be some limited interaction between the USGS technical representative and the successful contractor. The interaction will be in a preliminary phase only. The USGS technical representative will not be under the guidance of the successful contractor.  5.)	One of the "deliverables" in the Final Project Summary, #2, is that the "Contractor shall provide a report describing any processing of data required prior to interpretation."  If processing or reprocessing of the seismic is required prior to interpretation, this would significantly impact any time line developed for the project.  Is it expected that the project deadlines would be adjusted to accommodate possible months of delay, or are the USGS technologists expecting that these would be minor issues that could be dealt with quickly in-house, perhaps during the data loading phase? The expected processing of data required prior to interpretation is only anticipated to relate to minor issues such as post-stack balancing, filtering, etc. There is no anticipated reprocessing of pre-stack data involved on the part of the successful contractor. Any pre-stack re-processing will be done by USGS personnel in-house. 6.)	Section F.4 GS0917 demands a schedule of a five day work week on the project at the USGS site.  Does this assume that a single individual will be providing all of the work on the project?   The contractor can arrange the schedule as long as it provides the deliverables listed in phases one and two within the time period in clause GS0910.

<DESC>The General Services Administration’s Federal Technology Service, Region 5 Chicago, on behalf of the U.S. Air Force Electronic Systems Center (ESC) Forces Protection Squadron, is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) in order to identify companies having the technology, qualification and capabilities to provide Hand Held and Desktop Explosion Detection Equipment for over 200 Air Force installations both Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental States (OCONUS).  Capabilities/qualifications submitted in response to this RFI will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses will be evaluated for their viability.  The determination of procurement strategy, based upon the responses to this RFI, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All sources may submit a response, which will be considered by the government.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to publish any information provided by a respondent to the RFI if publishing such information is done without attribution (i.e., does not identify the party submitting the response materials), and would not reveal company trade secrets or other similar protected or proprietary information.  For example, if a respondent were to ask when the draft RFP would be released, then such a question could be published without attribution and would not jeopardize any corporate or trade secrets of the respondent.  Accordingly, the Government may publish such materials.  On the other hand, if a respondent were to provide detailed product rollout plans for a new device, then that material would not be published if properly marked.

We invite comments/information on the following:
•	A respondent’s commercial-off-the-shelf product(s) and capability(-ies) to meet the requirements as drafted in the attached technical requirements document.  
•	Whether the above products and capabilities are currently available on an established Government contract (i.e., GSA FSS Schedule).
•	Whether the above products and capabilities are currently available on the open market.
•	Typical pricing structure for Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.  Specifically, what is included in the unit price of the explosive detection device/equipment and what is priced separately?  For example, does the unit price of an explosive detection device/equipment include installation, manuals, training, technical support, upgrades, extended warranties, etc.
•	Client references to other Government Agency POC's with in-depth experience procuring similar devices.
•	Industry Performance Parameters and Measures of Performance/Standards for Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.  Please provide the Government with information and advice regarding recognized Government and/or Industry standards to describe the detailed technical capabilities of handheld and desktop explosives detection equipment.   The Government is especially interested in standards that might be used to describe the capabilities of such equipment generically, using the standard itself as a qualifying parameter for equipment procured, without going into the potentially classified details of the equipment's capabilities.  The Government's intent is to be able to specify the technical requirements of such devices by requiring compliance with a standard (that may itself contain detailed classified information) in a procurement that contains no specifically classified details in either the requirement statement or the resultant proposals. 
•	Security Classifications for Explosive Detection Equipment standards or performance capabilities.
•	Common commercial practices and standards for warranty coverage applicable to Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.  For example, what is and is not covered under the warranty(-ies)?  What is the duration of the warranty period?  Are extended warranties common and available for this equipment?
•	Common commercial practices and standards for preventative maintenance (i.e., How much preventative maintenance for explosive detection equipment is required?  Is this typically carried out end users or under maintenance agreements with the manufacturer or other service provider?).
•	Common commercial practices and standards regarding end user training on the use and maintenance of Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.
•	Management and operations associated with delivery of equipment, quality control, scheduling, training and technical support to include domestic and overseas locations. 
•	Contractor’s and/or potential subcontractors’ status as a small business, veteran owned small business, -HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, women-owned small business.
•	Proprietary Information.  Indicate specifically whether the response includes proprietary information, and which information should be considered proprietary.  Requirements for marking proprietary information are in FAR Subsection 3.104.  Note:  See FAR Subsection 3.104-4 for how this information will be safeguarded, if properly labeled.
This RFI is being issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the RFI.  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government’s use of such information.

Responses will be evaluated for their viability.  The determination of procurement strategy, based upon the responses to this RFI, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All sources may submit a response, which will be considered by the government.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to publish any information provided by a respondent to the RFI if publishing such information is done without attribution (i.e., does not identify the party submitting the response materials), and would not reveal company trade secrets or other similar protected or proprietary information.  For example, if a respondent were to ask when the draft RFP would be released, then such a question could be published without attribution and would not jeopardize any corporate or trade secrets of the respondent.  Accordingly, the Government may publish such materials.  On the other hand, if a respondent were to provide detailed product rollout plans for a new device, then that material would not be published if properly marked.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-OPM-049-06-I-0037
<RESPDATE>040306
<ARCHDATE>04182006
<CONTACT>Sharon Phillips, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-606-2461, Fax 202-606-2630, Email sharon.phillips@opm.gov
<DESC>This is a request for information purposes only.  AT THIS TIME, NO SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, and as such any request for a solicitation will not receive a response.  The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is seeking sources capable of providing services to implement a centralized, online system for the management of Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) pledges and their distribution and to provide customer support to Federal employee donors. Due to delays associated with irradiating mail at Government facilities, it is suggested that your package be sent by commercial delivery service.  

The purpose of this synopsis is to ask interested business and non-profit concerns to submit capability statements to evaluate the feasibility of maintaining an online workplace donation system designed to promote electronic CFC donations from Federal donors, provide those donors with central access to all CFC participating charities, and eliminate current CFC geographic restrictions to donating only to national and local charities eligible in the donor's local campaign.  No contract will be awarded as a result of this notice, however, a separate synopsis will be released prior to any such solicitation.  

Potential contractors should provide information concerning: (1)  software applications and support services for assigning unique identification codes for the estimated 15,000+  participating CFC charities; (2) software applications and support services to maintain a National CFC Charity Registry/Database and profile of all CFC charities; (3) software applications and support services that will allow over 1 million potential users to access the system during peak hours and to pledge electronically to charities located outside of the campaign corresponding to their official duty station; (4) software applications and support services that allow interface with local campaign fiscal agents (Principal Combined Federal Organizations (PCFOs)), Federal payroll offices and CFC charities; (5)  telephone-based voice recognition system for employees without internet access; (6) software applications and fiscal management services to support accountability on multiple levels (i.e. between contractor and donors, contractor and charities and contractor and PCFOs, and contractor and OPM); and, (7) information as to how a proposed contractor would respond to CFC regulatory and reporting compliance issues. 
Potential contractors would not be required to provide both the software and operations support, but must have the infrastructure and capacity to manage the entire system.   

The CFC program allows contributions from September 1 to December 15 of each year, therefore the software requirements for receiving on-line pledges is cyclical.  It is anticipated that information about the participating charities could be accessed year-round.  The overall system must comply with the regulatory requirements of the CFC found at www.opm.gov/cfc.  
 
OPM requests business and non-profit concerns to submit capability statements that include a description of the organization's ability to meet the above requirements.  It is important that submitted capability statements include complete information addressing each of the above information requirements and should include:  estimated price for development and implementation (including pricing per transaction), and estimated product development cycle for implementation.  Interested businesses should also submit information concerning the size, type, structure, and governance of the organization, and information and regarding experience with similar programs.  Capability statements will be reviewed to determine capacity to handle the scope of services required and pricing alternatives.  Responses to this synopsis must be received no later than 12:00 p.m. on April 3, 2006.  Please submit two copies of your response to: Sharon Phillips, Contracting Officer, Contracting Group, MS-CCFAS, U.S Office of Personnel Management, Room 1342, 1900 E Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20415. Due to delays associated with irradiating mail at Government facilitis, it is suggested that your package be sent by a commercial delivery service.

All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.

<DESC>The Mid-Pacific Region of the Bureau of Reclamation is conducting a market survey in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.001 to obtain feedback from industry regarding the general requirements for an upcoming procurement.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool to determine potential sources and interested parties in the intended procurement to perform wastewater upgrades and concrete work.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized and posted at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis. Furthermore, this procurement is being considered for 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns; however, ALL interested parties are requested to respond.  If adequate interest or sufficient supporting documentation is not received from HUBZone concerns, the solicitation may be issued as a small business set-aside or unrestricted basis without further notice or may be canceled.  Therefore, replies are requested from ALL interested parties, regardless of business size or category.  All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this synopsis not later than March 21, 2006, 2:00 PM PST.  Please submit all requested documentation listed below to: Debra A. Keith, Bureau of Reclamation, 2800 Cottage Way, Room E-1815, Sacramento, California 95825-1898.     Interested parties should submit a capabilities package not longer than 5 pages demonstrating the ability to perform the principal components of work listed below.  Packages should include the following information:  (1) Business name, address, CAGE code, size classification based on NAICS size standard, socioeconomic classification (e.g., HUBZone), and a point of contract, (2) a copy of the certificate issued by the SBA of your qualifications as a certified HUBZone small business concern, (3) a positive statement of your intention to submit an offer for this requirement as a prime contractor and (4) evidence of your experience performing work similar in type and scope to include:  contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts and points of contacts with telephone numbers and past experience regarding wastewater upgrades and concrete work similar to the type of work described below within the past 3 years.   In addition, Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102 and 4.1201, apply to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on CCR registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Information on Annual Representations and Certifications can be obtained via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Also, please include attachments cataloging the company's equipment assets, personnel resources and financial resources that demonstrate company responsibility and capability to perform the required work.  Responsible sources having relevant experience and the capabilities to perform the work will be considered.    The principal components of work are as follows:  A). Wastewater upgrades:  1.  Removal and disposal of an existing 7,000 gallon below grade wastewater holding tank which was used to contain waster disposal at the trailer dump station.  2.  Furnish and install a gravity sewer system consisting of 6-inch diameter PVC pipe that conveys the wastewater from the trailer dump station to an existing wet well at Lift Station #8, which then pumps all the wastewater collected at the New Melones Lake facilities to the sewage treatment lagoons.  B).  Concrete:  1.  Furnish and install precast concrete manholes.  2.  Drill/bore hole into existing wet well at Lift Station #8 to accommodate wastewater line.  All work is located at the Glory Hole Recreation Area, New Melones Lake, approximately 55 miles east of Stockton, California and 15 miles northwest of Sonora on State Highway 49 in Calaveras County, California.    The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990 and the related small business size standard in millions of dollars is $28.5.  However, the government reserves the right to change the classification if deemed necessary.  The estimated dollar magnitude of this project is anticipated to be between $100,000 and $250,000.  This procurement will require 100% performance and payment bonds.  It is anticipated that award of the work will occur in May 2006.

<CONTACT>SONYA BAIRD CONTRACTING OFFICER 9162789332     sbaird@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a public-private competition for the operation of the Geospatial Information Office (GIO), Geospatial Technology Operations Center (NGTOC) located at the Denver Federal Center in Lakewood, Colorado. This competition was announced in Fed Biz Opps on 30 September 2005 (www.fedbizopps.gov).  Under the rules of OMB Circular A-76, the Government will submit a proposal for a civil-servant led team or Most Efficient Organization (MEO) to perform the functions as specified in the Performance Work Statement which will be released at a later date.  The NAICS Code is 541990. The MEO is operating under the name NGTOC MEO and is seeking to partner with industry to collaborate in the development of the NGTOC MEO proposal.  The NGTOC MEO is looking for written expressions of interest from potential partners for operational services as outlined below:   (1) Develop and operate geospatial data integration, access, and archive capabilities, (2) perform data quality control and integration, (3) provide technical back office support to partners, (4) provide data steward training and support, (5) generate map graphics and maintain analog map archive, (6) provide digital geospatial information access, archive, and dissemination services, (7) provide support services such as administrative and generic information tehcnology support, (8) provide contract administration and management support for geospatial services, (9) conduct geospatial information science research, (10) assess and recommend for implementation, technological innovations for geospatial data and applications, (11) develop data theme business and investment strategy and data integration, (12) access, archive and ensure the quality of services relevant to NGTOC, (13) support development of industry-based standards that support geospatial infrastructures.  Go to the following URL to learn more about the organization: http: www.usgs.gov/ngpo. Interested partities should submit their capabilities statement to include: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel: This criterion evaluates the potential partners' relevant recent experience, past performance in similar activities, technical capability to perform the work, and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control: This criterion evaluates the potential partner's ability to control both cost and schedule. Potential partners should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Value-added services: This criterion evaluates the potential partner's ability to provide additional support services to the MEO team during the proposal development process. Responses to this notice should be no more than 8 pages, and should include, at a minimum:   	Name and address of firm 	Size/ownership of business, i.e., large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), Disabled-Veteran, Veteran, Woman owned business, and Hub Zone 	Number of years in business 	Point of contact with name, title, phone, fax and e-mail 	DUNS number  	Experience and familiarity with providing the services listed above either individually or in a consolidate services type environment, prime contracts, subcontracts. 	Specific areas listed above that the potential partner is interested in supporting, including how well the potential partner's core competencies suit the targeted areas above and how this benefits the NGTOC MEO.  	A statement detailing the potential partner's current business relationships with the U. S. Geological Survey.  Please include contract number and North American Industry Classification codes, if possible. The MEO will be reviewing past, present or planned organizational, financial, contractual or other interests to ensure compliance with organizational conflicts of interest requirements at FAR Subpart 9.5. The interests described above include those of the partner, its affiliates, proposed consultants, or proposed subcontractors. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  If a request for quotation is issued, it is expected that only those responding to this information request will be asked to respond to an RFQ. The partner(s) selected through that process will be asked to provide, at no cost to the USGS NGTOC MEO, the necessary conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates to be responsive to the requirements of the USGS. Upon U. S. Geological Survey selection of the winning offer of the standard competition, it is anticipated that the MEO proposal would result in contract(s) for the selected partner.  However, as the MEO, we cannot guarantee that this partnering opportunity will result in the award of any contracts by the Government, nor should this notice be construed as a commitment by the U. S. Geological Survey to pay for the information this notice is soliciting. The MEO has an interest in making its decision on partnering opportunities as soon as practical. Toward this end, the due date for submission of responses to this notice will be COB April 7, 2006.  The preferred method of response to this notice is by email to the attention of Craig Skalet, Deputy Regional Geographer, Central Region, U. S. Geological Survey, P. O. Box 24046, MS 507, Denver, CO 80255, email:  cdskalet@usgs.gov , Phone (303) 202-4306, fax (303) 202-4020.  Procurement questions should be directed to Sonya A.

<DESC>The General Services Administration’s Federal Technology Service, Region 5 Chicago, on behalf of the U.S. Air Force Electronic Systems Center (ESC) Forces Protection Squadron, is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) in order to identify companies having the technology, qualification and capabilities to provide Hand Held and Desktop Explosion Detection Equipment for over 200 Air Force installations both Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental States (OCONUS).  Capabilities/qualifications submitted in response to this RFI will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses will be evaluated for their viability.  The determination of procurement strategy, based upon the responses to this RFI, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All sources may submit a response, which will be considered by the government.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to publish any information provided by a respondent to the RFI if publishing such information is done without attribution (i.e., does not identify the party submitting the response materials), and would not reveal company trade secrets or other similar protected or proprietary information.  For example, if a respondent were to ask when the draft RFP would be released, then such a question could be published without attribution and would not jeopardize any corporate or trade secrets of the respondent.  Accordingly, the Government may publish such materials.  On the other hand, if a respondent were to provide detailed product rollout plans for a new device, then that material would not be published if properly marked.

We invite comments/information on the following:
•	A respondent’s commercial-off-the-shelf product(s) and capability(-ies) to meet the requirements as drafted in the attached technical requirements document.  
•	Whether the above products and capabilities are currently available on an established Government contract (i.e., GSA FSS Schedule).
•	Whether the above products and capabilities are currently available on the open market.
•	Typical pricing structure for Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.  Specifically, what is included in the unit price of the explosive detection device/equipment and what is priced separately?  For example, does the unit price of an explosive detection device/equipment include installation, manuals, training, technical support, upgrades, extended warranties, etc.
•	Client references to other Government Agency POC's with in-depth experience procuring similar devices.
•	Industry Performance Parameters and Measures of Performance/Standards for Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.  Please provide the Government with information and advice regarding recognized Government and/or Industry standards to describe the detailed technical capabilities of handheld and desktop explosives detection equipment.   The Government is especially interested in standards that might be used to describe the capabilities of such equipment generically, using the standard itself as a qualifying parameter for equipment procured, without going into the potentially classified details of the equipment's capabilities.  The Government's intent is to be able to specify the technical requirements of such devices by requiring compliance with a standard (that may itself contain detailed classified information) in a procurement that contains no specifically classified details in either the requirement statement or the resultant proposals. 
•	Security Classifications for Explosive Detection Equipment standards or performance capabilities.
•	Common commercial practices and standards for warranty coverage applicable to Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.  For example, what is and is not covered under the warranty(-ies)?  What is the duration of the warranty period?  Are extended warranties common and available for this equipment?
•	Common commercial practices and standards for preventative maintenance (i.e., How much preventative maintenance for explosive detection equipment is required?  Is this typically carried out end users or under maintenance agreements with the manufacturer or other service provider?).
•	Common commercial practices and standards regarding end user training on the use and maintenance of Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE; there is no solicitation available at this time.  No response will be provided for requests for a solicitation.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS PUBLISHED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. 

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA/NTDS) seeks potential sources for the development of nuclear radiation detectors for both gamma spectrometry and neutron spectrometry purposes. Sources must produce high resolution gamma spectrometers with the capability to operate in diverse field environments without the logistic burden of transporting cryogenic fluids such as liquid nitrogen.  The sources shall have the capability to manufacture germanium crystals of high purity and a production capability for high purity germanium (HPGe) gamma spectrometers.  In addition, the sources shall have a demonstrated knowledge of neutron multiplicity counting technology necessary to develop a practical neutron spectrometer for field environments. 

It is essential that these HPGe gamma spectrometers be fully effective when operated by adequately trained personnel with non-technical backgrounds.  The sources shall have experience in HPGe detector housings that are designed to permit "short cycling"; i.e., an HPGe detector can undergo a partial warm-up and be cooled back to operating temperature without the HPGe detector being required to reach room temperature before the cool down cycle is restarted.
 These detector systems must provide data through standard network and communications protocols in a format that is usable by non-technical but adequately trained operators.  The transmission of gamma spectra by wireless means is also required.  Integral neutron detection in these gamma spectrometers is also required.  The sources shall have an established field product support capability for all products that are commercially available. Sources must be able to obtain a DoD facility security clearance.

Sources sought responses shall reflect corporate information and a capability summary reflecting experience related to the above areas.  Responses are to be limited to no more than five pages.  Company information should include qualifications and experience in work of this nature, point of contact, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, CAGE code, DUNS Number, business size, and small business classification (8(a), HUBZone, etc.), if applicable.  Any information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice is strictly voluntary.  This synopsis is for information planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.   

Responses shall be submitted no later than 2:00pm EST on 30 March 2006.  Electronic responses are recommended and encouraged, and shall be submitted to Ms. Sharon Seiffert at Sharon.Seiffert@dtra.mil.  Non-electronic responses, though not preferred, may be submitted via facsimile to 703.767.4441 to the attention of Ms. Sharon Seiffert.  All documentation shall become the property of the Government.  

Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, to make award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of any effort in response to this Sources Sought Notice.  Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract.

<DESC>SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION

Office of the Chief Operating Officer – Disaster Assistance Support

AGENCY:  The U.S. Small Business Administration

ACTION: Request for Information


SUMMARY:

The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit input from interested parties on how the private sector can best support the delivery of SBA’s Disaster Assistance (a) within its current operational framework, and/or (b) within a guaranteed lending framework.  The goal of this RFI is to generate policy discussions about the potential role and capability of the private sector to deliver disaster assistance to homeowners, renters and businesses in the United States.  

BACKGROUND: 

In the late summer and fall of 2005, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma destroyed portions of Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.  These hurricanes wreaked devastation on home and business owners and collectively represent the worst natural disasters in the history of the United States of America.  The magnitude of these disasters caused more home and business owners to apply for disaster loans from SBA’s Office of Disaster Assistance (ODA) than any previous disaster. It is estimated that over 400,000 home and business owners will apply. 

The Small Business Act authorizes the SBA to make loans to eligible victims of declared disasters.  The ODA plans, directs, and administers the SBA’s responsibilities under the Act.  The mission of the ODA is to help people recover from disasters and rebuild their lives by providing affordable, timely and accessible financial assistance to homeowners, renters, businesses of all sizes and nonprofit organizations.  Further details that describe the SBA’s operating procedures for the delivery of its disaster assistance can be found in the attached appendix.

Generally, the SBA is committed to providing a decision to a disaster applicant within 21 business days upon receipt of their application.  In the past, the SBA has proven capable of meeting this commitment.  

However, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma pushed the capabilities of SBA’s program far beyond normal limits.  Due to the unprecedented nature of these disasters, average time to process 85% of all applications (the current SBA performance output measure) has exceeded the averages of previous years.  As a result, the SBA is soliciting input from interested parties on how the private sector can best support the delivery of SBA’s Disaster Assistance.  The goal is to initiate policy discussions about the potential role and capability of the private sector to deliver disaster assistance to disaster victims in the United States.  


GENERAL MODELS:  

There are two general models for processing applications.  The first is the current model where the Federal government makes direct loans.  The second model allows the Federal government to guarantee loans issued by banks and other lending institutions.  Both models are authorized by Section 7(b) of the Small Business Act.  

AREAS OF COMMENTS: 

In our preparation for future disasters, the SBA seeks ideas and options for complementing our existing resources.  Specifically, the Agency seeks comments on implementing one or both of the two models described above. 

The response should specifically address the following needs of the Federal government:

1)	The ability to process and close an extremely high volume of applications (e.g. 400,000+), potentially in multiple disparate geographic locations or across a large region of the country.
2)	The ability to process 85% of applications within 21 days.
3)	The ability to process applications in a cost effective manner.  While the Agency does not expect the response to provide a specific proposal for delivering services, it should include a discussion of estimated costs of a new or complementary system. 

DATES AND ADDRESSES:  

Responses should be submitted to SBA, Office of the Chief Operating Officer (COO), on or before 5:00 pm EST on  May 2, 2006 Electronic Reponses are preferred and should be addressed to: RFIResponse@SBA.GOV .  Include COO RFI Responses in the subject line. Non-electronic responses will also be accepted. Please send to:

DISCLAIMER: 

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.


 
Appendix A

When disasters such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, or earthquakes strike, federal, state, and local government agencies coordinate to provide assistance to disaster victims.  The SBA, through its Disaster Loan Program, is part of this concerted effort.  In the event of a disaster, SBA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and other government agencies join together to conduct a preliminary damage assessment to estimate the physical damage of the disaster on the affected region.  Among other criteria, if there is extensive physical damage, the governor of the affected state can request that the President declare that a major disaster or emergency situation exists, in which case federal assistance is made available to disaster victims, and FEMA takes the lead in coordinating response and recovery efforts.  The presidential disaster declaration specifies the area that is eligible for federal assistance, referred to as the “immediate” disaster area in this report. 

In the immediate area of the disaster, homeowners, renters, nonprofit organizations, and nonfarm businesses of all sizes are eligible to apply for SBA loans for the repair and replacement of uninsured physically damaged property. In addition, SBA provides certain loans to disaster victims in the counties adjacent to the immediate area; we refer to these counties as the “contiguous” disaster area.  In both the immediate and contiguous areas of the disaster, small businesses with no credit available elsewhere are eligible to apply for loans to cover economic losses.  

Once a declaration has been made, officials from one of SBA’s Field Operations Centers (Atlanta or Sacramento)--arrive at the disaster site to begin making preparations to assist disaster victims at the Disaster Recovery Centers--and begin meeting with victims to explain the disaster loan process, issue loan applications, and, if requested, assist victims in completing applications.  Most applications are issued by the Mail Out Center located in the Processing and Disbursement Center in Forth Worth, Texas as a result of referrals from FEMA.  

The SBA follows a series of steps involved in accepting, reviewing, approving or declining, and disbursing disaster loans.  SBA provides loans to households and businesses without credit available elsewhere at a maximum rate of 4 percent and up to a 30-year term.  For households or businesses with credit available elsewhere, SBA provides loans at a maximum rate of 8 percent and, for homes up to 30 years and businesses up to a 3-year term.  

There are six general disaster loan processing steps.  

First, state and federal officials conduct a preliminary damage assessment to estimate the extent of the disaster and its impact on individuals and public facilities.  SBA participates in the damage assessment when the damages include homes and businesses.  

Second, The President, USDA or SBA makes a disaster declaration.  

Third, SBA establishes a field presence; SBA employees meet with disaster victims, explain the loan process, and issue applications at the Disaster Recovery Centers; SBA screens the submitted applications for completeness and to make sure all necessary documents are provided.  

Fourth, physical loan applications accepted for processing are forwarded to loss verifiers who conduct on-site inspections of the damaged property to estimate the cost of restoring the property to pre-disaster condition.  

Fifth, once the application arrives at the SBA Processing and Disbursement Center, staff review the application, examining such issues as eligibility, duplication of benefits, credit history, personal history, tax returns, history on other SBA loans, and the history on other federal debt; the applicant’s losses or and where applicable calculating economic injury; the loan officer determines whether the applicant has satisfactory credit and the ability to repay the loan; the legal department determines whether there are any legal or regulatory restrictions on receiving a disaster loan; if the applicant meets SBA’s underwriting criteria, then the loan is approved, using the amount of verified losses as the basis for the loan amount; closing documents are prepared and mailed to the applicant.  

Sixth, applicants are required to obtain insurance; hazard insurance is required before disbursement over $10,000 for physical loans and over $5,000 for economic injury loans; flood insurance is required for properties located in Special Flood Hazard areas before any disbursement can be made; maximum initial disbursement without collateral is physical loans $10,000, economic injury loans $5,000; initial disbursement with collateral, preferably the applicant’s home $25,000; total disbursements with proof of ownership of the damaged property is physical loans and economic injury loans $25,000; total disbursement with proof of title insurance is physical loans and economic injury loans $250,000.  

Business loans are available up to $1.5 million, loans for physical damage to homes are available up to $200,000, and loans for the repair or replacement of personal property is available up to $40,000.

<DESC>One (1) Fixed Price Contract will be negotiated and awarded, with a base period and one option period.  The anticipated contract award date is June 2006.  The work will be accomplished primarily within the Vicksburg District, but may be within the Mi ssissippi Valley Division and other areas as needed to support the mission of the US Army Corps of Engineers.  This announcement is a SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  Effective 5 January 2005, the small business size standard for A-E services is $4.5 million, NA ICS code 541330.   2.  PROJECT INFORMATION:  The work consists of taking a defined number of discharge measurements on a routine basis along the Mississippi, Red and Ouachita Rivers.  The measurements will be taken with the use of an Acoustic Doppler Curre nt Profiler (ADCP) and a single beam depth sounder.  The data collected will be imported into personal computer software specifically designed to calculate flow measurements.  The software (program code) currently in use in the Vicksburg District will be m ade available during advertisement.  The work will also require collecting daily water stage data at approximately 50 gaging sites throughout the Vicksburg District and reporting information daily and monthly to the Vicksburg District.  Additional work wil l consist of maintenance of permanent reference elevation markers at each gaging site and infrequent collection of sediment samples at specific discharge ranges.  Extreme flow conditions may require a combination of the ADCP, a single beam depth sounder, a nd differential GPS.  The contractor may be required to take special purpose flow pattern and discharge measurements at lock and dam locations.  The contractor may be required to verify his system by comparison with conventional discharge methods.  All mea surements will be in English units.   3. PRE-SELECTION CRITERIA:  Pre-selection will be based on the following considerations, which are of equal importance.  The firm (either in house or through association of a qualified consultant) must demonstrate:  (a ) experience in the use of ADCP systems on rivers such as the Mississippi, Red, and Ouachita Rivers which have high sediment loads, extreme currents, and variations in depths from 10 to 120 feet; (b) the ability to use the ADCP in conjunction with a single  beam depth sounder and differential GPS, to produce a single product discharge measurement; (c) experience in discharge measurements by conventional methods; (d) a management plan for collecting, reporting and storing river stage data; and (e) a registere d land surveyor in either Arkansas, Mississippi or Louisiana.  Deliverables shall be provided in the following format (hard copy, floppy disc, electronic transmission and/or on media approved by the CO).  Each discharge reading will list the corresponding date, mean gage reading (feet), maximum depth (feet), width (feet), cross-sectional area (square feet), mean velocity (feet/sec), maximum velocity (feet/sec), overbank discharge (cubic feet), total discharge (cubic feet) and water temperature (degree Fahre nheit).  4. SELECTION CRITERIA:  The selection criteria are listed in descending order of importance (first by major criterion and then by each sub criterion).  Criteria A thru F are primary.  Criteria G thru I are secondary and will only be used as a tie -breaker, if necessary, in ranking the most highly qualified firms.  (A) Specialized experience and technical competence of the firm and consultants in the work described above in pre-selection items a, b, and c.  (B) Knowledge of the navigable waters in the Vicksburg District.  (C) Professional qualifications: The firm must indicate professional registration and work experience of key personnel.  The firm should emphasize professional registrations, certifications and specific work experience of key perso nnel.  (D) Capacity:  The firm should indicate the ability to perform on time regardless of unexpected equipment breakdowns, and/or personnel problems.  (E) Pas t Performance:  Consideration will be given to ratings on previous DoD contracts for engineering services.  (F) Knowledge of the locality.  (G) Geographic proximity to Vicksburg, Mississippi.  (H) Department of Defense contract awards in the past 12 months , the greater the awards the lesser the consideration.  (F) Extent of participation of SB, SDB, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), and Minority Institutions (MI) in the contract team. Participation will be measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU, or MI is a prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner, the greater the participation, the greater the consideration.  In the final selection process, the most highly  qualified firms will be interviewed and will have to demonstrate the ability to perform to the satisfaction of the Vicksburg District.  5. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Interested firms must send one combined copy of SF 330 for the prime and consultants and Pa rt II of the SF 330 for the prime and each consultant to: U.S. Army Engineer District, Vicksburg, ATTN: A-E Services (CEMVK ED CE), 4155 E.

<SUBJECT>B -- Notice of Intent to Award
<DESC>The contractor will provide accounting and consulting services to: support the financial statements compilation process; assist in developing, documenting and implementing General Ledger (GL) review and analysis procedures on a monthly basis; assist the FSA and CCC in resolving audit findings, and prepare documented adjustments to revise the financial statements and footnotes; develop a series of standard USSGL accounting relationships; assist FSA and CCC in identifying, documenting and correcting errors/inefficiencies in the financial statement development process after the compilation is complete.  While performing these tasks, the contractor will also assist FSA and CCC personnel in analyzing GL trial balance accounts and provide assistance with modifications, as needed, for FSA and CCC to conform to OMB Circular A-136.

The Period of Performance is March 20, 2006- September 30, 2006. 

The USDA intends to award a Delivery order to IBM. 
Rationale for Award: The basis for this sole source request is predicated on the fact that IBM has already performed a significant amount of the work for USDA FMD FSA/CCC since May 2005. If IBM does not complete this effort the Government will incur a significant financial loss. Due to the learning curve necessarily experienced for a firm to garner the required working knowledge of the complexities of CCC financials. IBM’s staff have already acquired the necessary knowledge of FSA/CCC funding and expenditure streams that would assure FSA and CCC will meet statutory deadlines.

Defense Logistics Agency
Defense Supply Center Richmond


PROGRAM OVERVIEW

Under the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990, 10 U.S.C. 2687 note, the BRAC Commission’s recommendation to privatize the supply, storage and distribution for packaged petroleum, lubricants, oils, and compressed gases (Federal Supply Classes 6830 and 9150) became law on November 8, 2005.  Cylinders and valves (FSC 8120) are implicitly included in this initiative, and all ozone depleting substances are excluded.  The Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) will lead the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) in this effort by transforming this portion of chemical supply chain through reductions in chemical use, waste, and lifecycle costs, for all of DLA’s continental U.S. (CONUS) customers and potentially OCONUS (overseas) customers.  Presently, DLA uses a multitude of sources, storage facilities, and delivery methods to satisfy its customers’ hazardous material needs.  DLA’s intention is to leverage the commercial industry and implement regional chemical management services programs across the U.S.  This initiative is designed to assure readiness, safety, and efficiency.  Ultimately, DLA’s goal is to improve lead-times, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction while allowing the customers to focus on their core competencies.

Anticipated Scope of Services:

Forecasting collaboration with customers - Accurately predicting future customer requirements/demand patterns.

Procurement/Purchasing - All actions related to acquisition planning, solicitation, evaluation, negotiations, contract award, contract administration, and contract management functions.

Inventory Management/Storage/Warehousing - The direction and control of activities with the purpose of getting the right inventory in the right place at the right time in the right quantity in the right form at the right cost.

Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health (ESOH) services (to include disposal) – To provide an effective, sound, environmentally safe and occupational health management system.  It is intended to be used in conjunction with other pertinent procedures, regulations, manuals, and guidance documents that support environmentally sound management.

Customer Direct - Ship directly to joint warfighter customers across a broad spectrum of locations both CONUS and potentially OCONUS.  Deliver items using shipping methods defined by terms and conditions of the contract (i.e. required delivery date, packaging requirements, delivery address, special instructions for emergency or other needs).  Track the delivery of items. 

Data Management - to include interoperability with industry and government systems.

Under the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990, 10 U.S.C. 2687 note, the BRAC Commission’s recommendation to privatize the supply, storage and distribution for packaged petroleum, lubricants, oils, and compressed gases (Federal Supply Classes 6830 and 9150) became law on November 8, 2005.  Cylinders and valves (FSC 8120) are implicitly included in this initiative, and all ozone depleting substances are excluded.  The Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) will lead the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) in this effort by transforming this portion of chemical supply chain through reductions in chemical use, waste, and lifecycle costs, for all of DLA’s continental U.S. (CONUS) customers and potentially OCONUS (overseas) customers.  Presently, DLA uses a multitude of sources, storage facilities, and delivery methods to satisfy its customers’ hazardous material needs.  DLA’s intention is to leverage the commercial industry and implement regional chemical management services programs across the U.S.  This initiative is designed to assure readiness, safety, and efficiency.  Ultimately, DLA’s goal is to improve lead-times, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction while allowing the customers to focus on their core competencies.

Anticipated Scope of Services:

Forecasting collaboration with customers - Accurately predicting future customer requirements/demand patterns.

Procurement/Purchasing - All actions related to acquisition planning, solicitation, evaluation, negotiations, contract award, contract administration, and contract management functions.

Inventory Management/Storage/Warehousing - The direction and control of activities with the purpose of getting the right inventory in the right place at the right time in the right quantity in the right form at the right cost.

Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health (ESOH) services (to include disposal) – To provide an effective, sound, environmentally safe and occupational health management system.  It is intended to be used in conjunction with other pertinent procedures, regulations, manuals, and guidance documents that support environmentally sound management.

Customer Direct - Ship directly to joint warfighter customers across a broad spectrum of locations both CONUS and potentially OCONUS.  Deliver items using shipping methods defined by terms and conditions of the contract (i.e. required delivery date, packaging requirements, delivery address, special instructions for emergency or other needs).

<DESC>BAA #AFRL/SNH06-01<br> <br> AIR FORCE RESEARCH LABORATORY<br> Sensors Directorate<br> <br> ELECTROMAGNETICS TECHNOLOGY DIVISION (AFRL/SNH) <br> RESEARCH INTERESTS<br> <br> A.  INTRODUCTION<br> <br> 	This is the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Electromagnetics Technology Division of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/SNH) under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Awards for proposals submitted in response to this BAA are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provision of PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  For purposes of this announcement, basic research (6.1) is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge and understanding related to long term national security needs rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution.  It provides part of the base for subsequent exploratory (6.2) and advanced (6.3) developments in defense related technologies.  Under this BAA 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 proposals are solicited. <br> <br> 	AFRL/SNH contracts with educational institutions, non profit organizations, and private industry for electromagnetics research.  This BAA is intended to cover, in general nature, all research areas of interest to the Division.  Persons contemplating submission of a proposal to the Electromagnetics Technology Division are encouraged to not only carefully peruse this BAA, but to contact the appropriate scientist identified in this publication as well, to ascertain the extent of interest which AFRL/SNH may have in a specific research project. <br> <br> 	The program is organized by scientific discipline, and the reader will note some overlap between sections.  The research areas described may have short or long-range impact on Air Force capabilities.  Typical research programs sponsored by AFRL/SNH vary in length from 12 to 30 months and require from 1 to 6 total man-years to complete.  If progress in certain areas requires several investigators, and especially if an interdisciplinary approach is necessary, AFRL will consider proposals for more comprehensive research programs.  Only a small number of such large programs can be initiated in a single fiscal year.  Inquiries related to comprehensive and interdisciplinary programs should be sent to the AFRL/SNH Division Chief. <br> <br> 	Proposals may be submitted at any time.  We strongly encourage informal discussion and submission of a brief outline of the proposed research (white paper) prior to the submission of a formal proposal.  Key AFRL staff members for each area of interest are identified in the description of that area.  To contact AFRL/SNH staff members by mail, write to the following address, using the appropriate branch symbol: <br> 				Air Force Research Laboratory /(BRANCH SYMBOL) <br> 				80 Scott Drive<br> 				Hanscom AFB MA 01731-2909<br> <br> B.  MISSION<br> <br> 	 The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) leads the discovery, development, and timely transition of affordable, integrated technologies that keep our Air Force the best in the world.  AFRL is organized into ten technology directorates.  The Electromagnetics Technology Division (AFRL/SNH) at Hanscom AFB MA is part of AFRL's Sensors Directorate, whose mission is to ensure unequaled reconnaissance, surveillance, precision engagement, and electronic warfare capabilities for America's air and space forces by conceiving, demonstrating, and transitioning advanced sensors and sensor technologies in partnership with industry, universities and other DoD agencies, as well as providing knowledgeable support to both the acquisition community and warfighters.  The Electromagnetics Technology Division, in turn, conducts basic research, exploratory development, and advanced development programs to meet Air Force systems needs for air, space, and C2 applications in electromagnetics, and in related electronic and electro-optics technologies.  AFRL/SNH explores the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from deep ultraviolet to microwaves, to satisfy growing war-fighter needs by providing cost effective performance options. <br> <br> C.  RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS<br> 	To support the mission of AFRL/SNH, research is required in the areas described below. <br> <br> a. ANTENNA TECHNOLOGY<br> The objective of this program is to advance the understanding of array and multiple beam antennas for manned aircraft, UAV's, and both ground- and space-based platforms.  The program encompasses several areas of major activity dealing with fundamental electromagnetics, array control, active array architecture, antenna measurements, and array affordability. Crucial electromagnetic issues include radiation patterns and mutual coupling of antenna elements in arrays, the analysis of antennas conformal to vehicle or support structures, the analysis of printed circuit array elements, and the development of new types of radiators for increased bandwidth or multiple frequency radiation.  The program is concerned with many issues of antenna control.  It deals with digital beamforming, optical distribution of phasing and control signals, novel concepts for limited-scan arrays, and adaptive or intelligent means of aperture control for null steering, local failure detection, compensation, and correction in very large phased arrays including the use of both expert systems and neural networks. Multifunction, multifrequency, reconfigurable arrays for aircraft that can be made a structural part of the aircraft skin need to be understood. Major efforts within the program address the architectural aspects of array fabrication with active amplifiers.  At SHF and EHF frequencies the primary concern is to employ active devices to enhance array control by using amplitude control as well as phase control.  This added flexibility may eliminate the use of hard-wired beamformers and, in addition, may improve the null steering capabilities of adaptive arrays.  The program seeks advances in antenna front-end technology to achieve low cost, low loss, lightweight, compact antenna control over the spectrum from microwave to terahertz frequencies.  Of particular interest is the development of microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices, with the goal of reducing the size, weight, and power (SWAP) requirements for large phased arrays.  The effort exploits new materials and new device, and component concepts for lower loss in passive circuits, higher efficiency in active circuits, higher levels of integration, and expanded performance capabilities.  Key antenna architectural issues include the minimization of required via holes, thermal design, bandwidth enhancement, and multi-layer board integration of control and microwave distribution circuits.  Antenna measurement topics of interest include the measurement of very large apertures which are either so large that one cannot make far field measurements, so non-rigid as not to be self-supporting in the earth's gravity field, or so large that funding limitations prohibit assembling the complete antenna structure.  In each of these cases, there is a need to predict and validate the antenna performance to -60dB levels.   Point of Contact:  LIVIO D. POLES, AFRL/SNHA, Tel 781-377-4087, email: livio.poles@hanscom.af.mil. <br> <br> b.  ELECTROMAGNETIC SCATTERING FROM TARGETS AND TERRAIN<br> 	This research is concerned with the scattering of electromagnetic energy from 1) bodies of arbitrary size, shape, and composition, and 2) a wide variety of terrain types representative of real earth.  Frequencies of interest range from 3 MHz to 300 GHz.  Areas of interest include the calculation of scattering cross-sections from arbitrary multi-wavelength conducting, coated, or penetrable bodies.  Also of interest are high-resolution-radar, bistatic radar phenomena, including depolarization, and the statistical description of bistatic data.  Research is conducted towards the development of algorithms that will allow the integration of phenomenological data from multiple sources for improved detection and identification of difficult targets.  The effect of target and clutter depolarization on the signal to clutter ratio is also of interest.  The target program consists of both theory and measurements. The terrain program seeks research which provides the necessary understanding to formulate predictive models of scattering from a variety of terrain, especially when covered with foliage and vegetation; the collection of data that have been calibrated absolutely; and the analysis of the effects of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and terrain on the performance of radar systems.  The effects of clutter reduction using polarization diversity are also being studied. The effect of clutter cell size on the statistics of the scattered waves in high-resolution, and bistatic radar systems is under investigation.  A comprehensive understanding of statistical behavior of scattering phenomenology is required for the development and validation of models to enhance the performance of adaptive signal processing algorithms with respect to reducing the number of adaptive degrees of freedom, sample support, and computational cost required to suppress clutter.  Issues of importance are robust performance in fiercely non-stationary environments with emphasis on CFAR. Results obtained, for both target and clutter situations, will be used in the design, development, and evaluation of future space-based and airborne radar systems, and for improved detection and target identification in existing radar systems operating against ground-based targets and low-observable airborne targets in a dense clutter environment.   Point of Contact:  BERTUS WEIJERS, AFRL/SNHE, Tel 781-377-1733, email: bertus.weijers@hanscom.af.mil<br> <br> c.  OPTRONICS COMPONENTS and ALGORITMS<br> 	This effort is concerned with basic research and exploratory development of advanced performance optronic components, subsystems, and algorithms for Air Force "space and air" image restoration/recognition, multispectral detection and non-cooperative ID, target tracking, threat warning and countermeasures, missile guidance, and high bandwidth communications/data-network systems.  The emphasis will be on integrable components and technologies in the III-V and group IV materials systems. This includes indium phosphide (InP), gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), and their alloys.  This does not exclude other technologies or materials systems such as fiber-based devices, organic semiconductors, and non linear optical (NLO) materials, waveguides, and devices.  In addition, new heterogeneous devices and integration techniques offering functional performance beyond the capability of similar homogeneous devices in any material system will be considered.  Of particular interest is component research using, for example, fusion and lift-off or other techniques that provide process compatibility for the integration of high performance state-of-the-art components for space applications without performance degradation.  Other categories include pattern recognition algorithms and architectures, spatial light modulators, and the development of new nonlinear optical materials and the optimization of existing materials. In the category of new nonlinear optical materials, the goal is to provide a material which simultaneously has sub-millisecond response times, high optical efficiency, and low laser power density requirements.  Emphasis is on materials that can be made to work well at visible and IR laser wavelengths.  Research in this category can include, for example, photorefractive materials such as BaTiO3 or bandgap engineered materials such as multiple quantum wells. Also of interest are materials that can transfer wavefront information between visible and non-visible electromagnetic waves, for example, visible and infrared.  In the optical signal processing category, we want functions that work in real time.  This can include research into new techniques for performing operations such as correlation, convolution noise removal, edge enhancement, image multiplexing, and optical storage.

IMAGE EXPLOITATION OF INFRARED CAMERAS<br> Our activities in this area have ranged from the study of metal silicides as infrared photo detectors, to fabrication of complete IR sensor systems, to field testing of cameras, to the development of algorithms for special purpose applications.  Recent emphasis is to exploit and extend the applications addressed by modern staring infrared cameras through image/signal processing algorithm development and prototype hardware implementations.  The major research areas are: development of image/signal processing algorithms for IR image enhancement; algorithms for the detection/tracking of unresolved targets in clutter in consecutive frame IR imagery; and algorithms for hyperspectral data acquisition, data reconstruction, and analysis.  In-house-developed thermal infrared sensors and hyperspectral imagers support the research and hinge the algorithm work very closely to real-world data. Image and signal processing algorithms for image exploitation applications with large format infrared arrays must meet the challenge of real-time operation.  Key applications involve the extraction of information from IR imagery such as through spectral discrimination, point target detection/tracking, range determination, etc.  Improved understanding and control of the effects of noise and ground and cloud clutter and studies on how staring arrays behave in various environments such as on moving platforms are important auxiliary topics to address in conjunction with the algorithm development.

Best value includes past performance, technical acceptability and price. Offers must meet all minimum specifications but offers which exceed minimums may be rated more favorably.

Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price.

Nonreworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose.  Should any of the reparables be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 
 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

Assessment NCAPS Computer Adaptive Program Functioning


1.0 INTRODUCTION

To enlist in Naval service applicants must meet the minimum basic requirements on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), a test battery which assesses performance in reading, mathematics, general science, as well as basic knowledge about electronics, mechanical systems, and automotive-shop.  Applicants are required to provide information about their criminal and financial history, and pass a brief physical examination; if there is no disqualifying information, the applicant may enlist into naval service.  A classifier uses ASVAB scores and identifies which technical training schools the applicant is likely to pass and compares this list against jobs the Navy identifies as ‘critical-to-fill.’  The classifier attempts to interest the applicant in one of the critical jobs in a roughly 7 minute interview. At the conclusion of this very brief meeting, the classifier and applicant come to an agreement and a contract is signed guaranteeing the technical training school. This agreement functionally dictates the applicant's entire Navy career path. However, as Borman, et al., (2003) discussed in their review of selection and classification, individuals are more complex and multidimensional than can be measured by the ASVAB alone. The ASVAB predicts cognitive performance – it was developed to predict learning requirements in training. Beyond the cognitive abilities assessed by the ASVAB, individuals possess a variety of preferences, interests, and personal characteristics that should be useful for identifying who will be best suited for military missions of the future. 

Currently, the Navy is undergoing tremendous technological and organizational changes influencing Sailors’ entire career continuums. At the forefront of these major changes is the understanding that high-technology warfighting systems and platforms will never replace the need for high-quality, highly motivated, and highly committed Sailors. The young people that the Navy needs expect to be assigned to jobs that match their personal interests and competencies. They expect personal growth and advancement, which, along with job satisfaction, become key inducements for long-term service and commitment. Therefore, it is necessary to match people along a multitude of dimensions into the best-fitting Navy job available. “Best-fitting” will no longer mean the limited outcome of completing technical training. Instead, best-fitting will reflect all of the outcomes important to Sailors and the Navy. It will mean that the applicant will likely perform well in both classroom and laboratory training, will be proficient on the job, be reliable, work well in groups, be satisfied with the job, be promoted, and be likely to reenlist. The development and validation of predictive personality scales is an important step in fulfilling that vision. 
The ASVAB is a good predictor of performance through training; it predicts only some types of performance in the fleet (McHenry, Hough, Toquam, Hansen & Ashworth, 1990). However, many studies have found that measuring personal variables greatly enhances our ability to predict who will perform successfully across a variety of jobs in civilian and military settings.  For instance, conscientiousness is one of the best predictors of performance across a variety of jobs. By adding a measure of conscientiousness, an additional 18% of variation in on-the-job performance can be explained. Another important personality trait that accounts for an additional 10% of variance in performance is Emotional Stability. In fact, an investigation with military participants found that measuring emotional stability accounted for an additional 38% increase in incremental validity (see Ferstl et al., 2003).

While assessment of personality seems promising, personality tests are still not used in Navy selection or classification.  There are many reasons for this. Most personality tests were designed to detect psychopathology and not to predict performance in the Armed Services. While there have been a few large-scale studies, most are limited to small groups. Most personality tests are too long and cumbersome to be delivered efficiently.  Perhaps most importantly, personality tests have not been widely validated against actual on-the-job performance across the many different occupations in the Navy. This project seeks to address each of these difficulties.

Navy Computer Adaptive Personality Scales (NCAPS) is an innovative instrument developed with ONR funding to assess non-cognitive attributes for the purpose of classifying recruits into enlisted positions in the US Navy. Personality assessment is part of the whole person assessment approach to improve Sailor classification thereby reducing unwanted attrition and increasing job performance. NCAPS will allow Navy classifiers to create personality profiles of new recruits. These profiles can then be matched to available Navy jobs for an optimal person-job fit.

A working version of NCAPS has been developed and is currently being tested. In order for NCAPS to become operational, it is imperative to determine if model utilized for adaptive item presentation is working properly. If the model is working properly it constructs codes for various tests, statement parameters are read into the program from an ACCESS database, and the number of tests to be administered is determined.  An ordering of constructs is determined.  Test administration begins with the first construct and cycles through all in a predefined order until testing is complete (the posterior standard deviation falls below a value corresponding to the 90% credibility interval, or maximum test length reached.) For a given construct, however, testing can stop early if too few statements are available for administration (and possibly if the available items are not informative enough.)  Results are written to ACCESS fields and to text files.  The text files show the construct codes, items administered, parameter values for statements, and the examinee’s responses.  



2.0 TECHINCAL REQUIREMENTS/TASKS

The contractor shall perform the following activities.

2.1 Utilize NCAPS text files (described above) and rescore the item responses by the contractor’s one dimensional Zinnes-Griggs expected posterior estimate (EAP) program.  

2.2 The contractor shall verify that a.) the NCAPS software is correctly linking statement parameter values to the statements that are being administered, b.) the examinee’s responses are being correctly linked to the administered statements, and c.) the EAP estimates are being correctly calculated.  

2.3 The contractor shall run the NCAPS software on simulation data that have been previously analyzed and examined extensively to determine the fidelity between the programs.

2.4 Upon completion of work in Tasks 2.1-2.3, the contractor shall prepare a final report as documentation of the total project. The report will include the algorithm underlying NCAPS, the various checks and tests that we performed, and all other findings pertinent to the project and necessary for replication.


3.0 LOCATION OF WORK
	
Work will take place at the contractor’s facilities. 

4.0 TRAVEL 

None.

5.0 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

Three (3) months from the date of award.

6.0 REPORTS, DATA, AND OTHER DELIEVERABLES

-Technical report encompassing the entire project.

7.0 REVIEWS, INSPECTIONS, AND ACCEPTANCE

All reviews, inspection, and acceptance will be performed by NPRST, Code 13.

8.0 GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES

NPRST will provide the contactor with NCAPS code and supporting software for evaluation purposes only. The NCAPS item pool is proprietary and solely owned by the Navy, therefore the contractor does not have permission to duplicate and/or use any NCAPS items in any form or forum. Offers are due back March 28, 2006 at 4:00P.M. to FISC Jacksonville, Millington Detachment, 5722 Integrity Drive, Bldg 456, 3rd Floor, ATTN: Jackie Appleton, (901-874-5274.

The Contractor must maintain, at a minimum, a 95% (less reader preventive maintenance downtime) reader uptime or in service rate.  In order to determine the uptime or in service rate, the COR or his designated representative, will periodically and randomly check all of the readers in the room to verify their operability and then calculate whether the 95% uptime or in service rate is being maintained.  If the equipment uptime or in service rate drops below 95% at any time, the contractor must furnish functionally equivalent machines in good operating condition to maintain the 95% equipment uptime or in service rate while the defective machines are being repaired.  REPLACEMENT PARTS.  The contractor must only use manufacturer¡¦s new original or factory refurbished parts in the performance of this contract, except when the manufacturer or its successor companies no longer provide new or factory service parts for a malfunctioning machine.

Statement of Work/Specifications

A.1 Introduction:
The U.S.Department of Commerce(DOC),National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA),Aircraft Operations Center (AOC),MacDill AFB,Florida, intends to exchange four T56-A-14 engines in “as is” condition with complete logbooks for one, 0.0 hour(all modules) Time Since Overhaul (TSO)T56-A-14 engine in “Ready for Installation”(RFI) condition with logbooks and two,overhauled to zero time PT6A-27 engines with logbooks.

A.2 Background:	
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operate two Lockheed WP-3D aircraft designated for atmospheric research. Four Rolls-Royce T56-A-14 engines power each WP-3D.  NOAA also operates a fleet of four DeHavilland DHC-6-300 Twin Otter aircraft. These aircraft use the Pratt and Whitney PT6A-27 engine. Currently, NOAA has two spare, RFI T56-A-14 engines. With the projected acquisition of a third P-3C, NOAA anticipates the requirement for one additional spare,0.0 hour Time Since Overhaul(TSO),RFI T56-A-14 engine. Additionally, NOAA does not have any spare zero time engines for the fleet of Twin Otters. With the ever increasing amount of annual flight hours flown by these aircraft,it would be in NOAA’s best interest to have two spare,0.0 hour TSO PT6A-27 engines. The NOAA AOC in Tampa, Florida,manages these aircraft.

A.3 Scope:
Engines to be exchanged are as follows:

-T56-A-14 serial number 0TH9044 with 14,804.5 hrs Time Since New (TSN)
-T56-A-14 serial number 0TH8010 with 15,209.3 hrs TSN.
-T56-A-14 serial number 0TH8000 with 16,429.0 hrs TSN.
-T56-A-14 serial number 0TH4515 with 20,295.3 hrs TSN.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML-6011. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-07 dated 2/2/06. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), performs basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing six bacterial pathogen genomes was performed towards achieving those goals. The RML has a need to purchase approximately 1 (one) lot of custom chips from Affymetrix, lot size shall be approximately 90 (ninety) chips. This chip is unique and specific to RML.  The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix.  The chip is high density,  at 106 per cm2 (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip® was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip® probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip® probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip® probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip® probe array is  housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array. We will process the chips on our Affymetrix system which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray® Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix  is compatible with the Affymetrix system in place within the Genomics Unit of the Research Technologies Section. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Inside delivery shall be six (6) weeks after receipt of the order by Affymetrix.  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION 
For
Purchase Request: F4FBFX6048A100

1. SDS International, Inc., 1320 Central Park Blvd, STE 300, Fredericksburg, 
VA 22401, is the only known source that can satisfy the government's 
requirements (AFRL/HECB) in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii). No other company produces a software terrain database tool that allows a user, verses a highly trained database generation technician, to rapidly generate round-earth, geo-specific, high-fidelity databases using government source data with optimized run-time performance for both ground (including MOUT) and flight based applications and is compatible with the government current system. Our requirement is for a tool that can rapidly (within 10 hours) create military operations in urban terrain (MOUT) types of databases from government data file formats: GEOTIFF, NITF, DTED 1 & 2 and ESRI shape files: linear (roads), point features (buildings), and areals - (tree boxes). The database generated must be compatible with our current LiteFlite®, BATCAM, AeroVironment, inc. RAVEN & Pointer Sim, and Spectator/NEXWARS simulations and be compatible with other AAcuity® IG equipped simulators such as future versions of the FATS Inc. IFACT 300D that support such rapidly generated terrains. The objective is to provide easy-to-use, cost-effective in-house rapid terrain generation capabilities to support rapidly-evolving research activities using highly-realistic, geo-specific locations, thus saving significant time and money over an approach that relies upon out-sourcing terrain generation tasks. At a typical outsourcing cost of over $25K per database, the tool would save hundreds of thousands of dollars over a very short period, while ensuring flexibility and adaptability through direct user control. The other alternative, the in-house use of other database generation tools, would typically take 4-5 fives times longer than using the SDS tool and would require the hiring of a full time database engineer.  This approach would not only lengthen database generation turn-around times, but would also require additional manpower and the added expense associated with that position. The first year's added manpower costs alone would more than pay for the terrain generation tool. In summary, The GeoSource-RTB(tm) rapid terrain generation tool is required to effectively mature and evaluate human factor issues associated with BATMAN and BAO equipment (HMD, TAC Earplug, speech recognition, etc.) in a relevant, simulated environment and alternative approaches could delay our schedules as much as a year. The estimated value of the procurement is approximately $86,000.

2. This procurement will be synopsized in accordance with FAR Part 5

3. AFRL/HECB will continue to monitor the market to determine the existence of other potential sources that can provide the level and type of radiometer technology required by the government.

4. Therefore, it is hereby determined, SDS International is the only responsible source qualified to meet the government's requirements for this procurement.

<DESC>Infection Control Policy for
Construction and Renovation


Background

Fungal spores occur naturally in the environment, such as soil & plants.  These spores can also be found in plaster, building materials, ceiling tiles and dust.  The generation of dust during construction and maintenance activities may cause dispersal and dissemination of fungal spores.  Although usually not a problem for a healthy person, in the health care environment, these spores can cause serious illness or even death in some individuals.  For this reason it is important that correct infection control and dust control measures be followed during construction and maintenance activities.



Risk Areas

Buildings 1 through 6 are divided into high risk and low risk areas depending upon patient acuity and the patient care activities carried out.  Color-coded drawings designating high and low risk areas are available thorough Facilities Management.   Together with the Infection Control Section, Facilities Management will update the drawings at least annually.  Contractors planning construction or maintenance activities must review a copy of these drawings and provide appropriate barrier precautions for the designated areas.



Construction Project Activities

Construction project activities are grouped by invasiveness and potential for generating dust.

Type A – Inspection and non-invasive activities
Includes but is not limited to:
-	removal of ceiling tiles for visual inspection
-	painting (but not sanding)
-	wallcovering, electrical trim work, minor plumbing, and activities which do not generate dust or require cutting of walls or access to ceilings other than for visual inspection

Type B – Small scale, short duration activities that create minimal dust
Includes but is not limited to:
-	installation of telephone and computer cabling
-	access to chase spaces
-	cutting of walls or ceiling where dust mitigation can be controlled

Type C – Work that generates a moderate to high level of dust or requires demolition or removal of any fixed building components or assemblies
Includes but is not limited to:
-	sanding of walls for painting or wall covering
-	removal of floor coverings, ceiling tiles, and casework
-	new wall construction
-	minor duct work or electrical work above ceilings
-	major cabling activities
-	any activity which cannot be completed within a single work shift

Type D – Major demolition and construction projects
Includes, but is not limited to:
-	activities which require consecutive work shifts
-	requires heavy demolition or removal of a complete cabling system
-	new construction



Infection Control Precautions

Level 1 – Routine Infection Control Precautions
A.	Maintain manpower and equipment, including dust mops, wet mops, brooms, buckets and clean wiping cloths for cleaning fine dust from floors.
B.	Clean up dust tracked outside of work area immediately.
C.	Dampen surfaces, if needed, to control dust.
D.	Debris will be removed in tightly covered containers.
E.	Ceiling tiles removed for any reason will be replaced at the end of the workday.
F.	Affix temporary closures or make permanent repairs to any holes or openings in walls, ceilings or floors prior to leaving the area.

Level 2 – Localized Precautions
To Level 1 Routine Infection Control Procedures add:
A.	Arrange to reroute unnecessary traffic in the area and place signage indicating temporary route, if appropriate
B.	Use control cube for ceiling work if area cannot be vacated.  Control tube must extend from floor to ceiling and be dust tight.
C.	Seal doorways for projects that generate large amounts of dust.
D.	Seal or filter exhaust & ventilation ducts.  Where practical, increase exhaust in the area.
E.	Install tack mats at interior and exterior of all openings that allow egress from the work area.  Change tack mats at least daily (or according to manufacture’s recommendations).

Level 3 – Rigid Barrier Precautions
To Level 1 and Level 2 controls add:
A.	Erect rigid walls at entrances and exits, or create an airtight plastic barrier prior to the beginning of the construction and demolition.  Each entrance and exit must be constructed so that it has a door or double flap of plastic to prevent the escape of dust and other airborne contaminants
B.	Isolate HVAC system in area where work is being done.  Seal all vent openings before work begins to prevent contamination of the duct system.
C.	Maintain negative pressure within work site using HEPA-equipped air filtration units.
D.	Upon completion of work, vacuum work area with HEPA filtered vacuums.  Wet mop area with hospital-grade disinfectant.

<DESC>Amendment 07 Questions and Answers:

Q1. Due to the restrictive of Multimode equipment and interfaces, at the market and with the aim to guarantee the quality of the services and to avoid to make conversions from Monomode to Multimode that sometimes generate point of flaw.
 It is possible that the vendor provide and install 12 pair Monomode fiber optic, instead of multimode?

A1. Yes, as long as the vendor is aware that they will be responsible for providing any and all necessary equipment necessary to provide the required services to the Embassy.

Q2. Will the government support the HUB Zone rebate? 

A2. No, this is an unrestricted requirement and local firms will be participating. 

Q3. Will the government consider extending the base contract term to at least 2 years?  Given the significantly broad extent of work and relatively remote geography, a 1-year base contract represents large risk to industry.  The government would attract the maximum number of bidders by reducing risk in offering at least a 2-year guarantee of business (base contract term), of course assuming excellent vendor performance.
 
A3. The contract period is a base year of 12 months with four one year options.
