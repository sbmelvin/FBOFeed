<RESPDATE>033016
<CONTACT>Jonathan M. Lear, Contracting Officer, Email john.lear@nih.gov
<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Leica Microsystems, Inc., 1700 Leider Lane, Buffalo Grove, IL 60089 to provide the EM ICE High Pressure Freezer to the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The NHLBI Electron Microscopy Core Facility provides technical assistance, service, and training for researchers at NHLBI and throughout NIH. Researchers use the Core to examine cellular and molecular processes and components at a higher resolution than light microscopy can provide. Currently, the Core follows conventional chemical sample preparation protocols that introduce well-known artifacts and reduce antigenicity of the samples. The Core aims to develop cryo-techniques, including high pressure freezing and cryo-ultramicrotomy. High pressure freezing minimizes artifacts and preserves samples as close to their native state as technologically possible. Cryo-ultramicrotomy retains the antigenicity of samples, which allows for a greater likelihood of successful immunolabeling. These techniques facilitate research performed at the Core by allowing accurate interpretation of micrographs due to a decrease in artifacts and enhanced resolution of immunolabeling through greater antigenicity and staining.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is for a contractor to provide the EM ICE High Pressure Freezer to the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR).</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the following:</p>
<p>-	Leica EM ICE (No : 16771801)<br />-	Flat specimen 3mm system (No : 16771828)<br />-	Flat specimen 6mm system (No : 16771829)<br />-	3mm sapphire discs system for LS (No : 16771871)<br />-	3mm finder grids (No : 16770131269)<br />-	Coating mount f. 3&amp;6mm sapphire disks (No : 16770131350)<br />-	Microscope M80 for EM ICE (No : 16771861)<br />-	Fluorescence Module GFP (No : 16771863) <br />-	Heating elements for loading station and table (No : 16771859)<br />-	Table extension (No : 16771869)<br />-	Trisection pod for specimen Dewar (No : 16771866)<br />-	Microscope stage insert for CLEM (No : 16770159)<br />-	Nozzle (2x) (No : 16771865)<br />-	Light stimulation package (No : 16771858)<br />-	Light Module Blue (450 Lambda) (No : 16771842)</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that the Leica EM ICE is the only High Pressure Freezer system capable of integrating with the NHLBI Electron Microscopy Core's existing system configuration. This integration is critical to maintain the laboratory experiments currently in progress in the core. Any other system would not be compatible and could cause delays for the lab.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>

</strong>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 12--Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>
<p>The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-NOI-16-286 and the solicitation is issued as a PRE-SOLICITATION, NOTICE OF INTENT, to award a contract on a noncompetitive basis to ProAim Americas, LLC located at P.O. Box 724, Grover, MO 63040.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY &amp; STATUTORY AUTHORITY</strong><br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, and FAR Part 12--Acquisition of Commercial Items and is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13--Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6--Competition Requirements.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-87-1, dated March 16, 2016.</p>
<p><strong>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE</strong><br />The associated NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with size standard of 500 Employees.</p>
<p><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</strong><br />The non-competitive determination is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10--Market Research, specifically the results of market research concluded that only Carl Zeiss Microscopy-brand Blue 400 System upgrade is acceptable for this requirement to ensure continuity of science and continued functionality of proprietary equipment.</p>
<p>Specifically, The NINDS Surgical Neurology Branch (SNB) owns a Carl Zeiss Microscopy-brand OPMI Pentero 900 Microscope which requires a Carl Zeiss Blue 400 System upgrade to capture PPIX, a non-toxic by-product of 5-ALA that accumulates in tumor cells, during 5-ALA Florescence-Guided brain surgeries. The owned Pentero Microscope is proprietary to Carl Zeiss, its original equipment manufacturer, and only Carl Zeiss Microscopy equipment upgrades integrate with this proprietary equipment and equipment software. If a different brand of equipment was acquired, continuity and integrity of study data generated by the Pentero Microscope would be jeopardized due to hardware and software incompatibility. The Pentero microscope would not be fully operational, would not be able to perform the PPIX capture, and study data would become non-standardized. This would create significant loss of study data which would be detrimental to the NINDS and SNB research.</p>
<p>However, while only Carl Zeiss Microscopy-brand equipment can meet the needs of this requirement, market research, which included communication with Carl Zeiss Microscopy, indicates that the company authorizes only one vendor, the reseller ProAim Americas, LLC, to provide the required equipment. Carl Zeiss provided a sole source letter to this effect which confirms that Carl Zeiss does not sell the required system directly and that it may only be purchased through ProAim Americas, LLC. Accordingly, only ProAim Americas, LLC is capable of meeting the needs of this requirement.</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  <br /> <br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">Purpose and Objectives</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">The mission of the Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute on Drug Abuse is to conduct state-of-the-art research on basic mechanisms that underlie drug abuse and addiction, and to develop new methods for the treatment of drug abuse and addiction.&nbsp; Research is supported at the molecular, genetic, cellular, animal, and clinical levels and is conceptually integrated, highly innovative, and focused on major problems in the field.&nbsp; The long-term goal of the research is to better understand the biological and behavioral factors contributing to initiation, maintenance, and elimination of drug abuse and addiction (and associated diseases), and to translate this knowledge into improved strategies for preventing, treating, and reducing the negative consequences for the individual and for society caused by drug abuse and addiction.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;">The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) requires Ventilated rack and cages to accommodate mice. </span></p>

<DESC>The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Birmingham, AL that will be expiring.
<p>The Government requires office and related space yielding a minimum/maximum of 10,193 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet along with 7 surface parking spaces.</p>

<p>Offered space must meet Government requirements for fire safety, accessibility, seismic, and sustainability standards per the terms of the lease. The proposed leased space shall be fully serviced. Offered space shall not be in the 100-year flood plain. Subleases are not acceptable.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

The Parking Structure will hold approximately 400 vehicles on four levels of parking:  an at-grade level plus three (3) elevated tiers.  Vehicle access to and egress from the Parking Structure will be on its north side - from inside the remaining portion of surface parking lot #7. Vehicular entrance level will be the Lower Level ("L"). There will be one stair tower at the northeast corner, and one stair/elevator tower at the southwest corner. Pedestrian access to and egress from the Parking Structure will be at Level "1" - facing south - at the southwest corner stair/elevator tower and Level "L" at the northeast stair tower. The elevator tower consists of two hydraulic elevators which will traverse four distinct levels:  L, 1, 2, and 3.

The Parking Structure will require three sources of electrical power from Building 111 but through the newly construction Parking Structure Lot 7 (Bldg. 151): Normal, Life Safety, and Equipment Emergency. There is limited HVAC and plumbing work including a water wash-down system for deck maintenance and the appropriate drainage systems to existing sanitary and/or storm sewerage. Lighting in the Parking Structure will be primarily by LED lighting for energy efficiency and long-life benefits.  For safety and security, there will be emergency "Talk-a-Phones at each level in each of the two stairwells. The Parking Structure will NOT be served by an emergency generator. Since the Parking Structure is an open-style structure, a fire suppression (sprinkler) system is NOT required.  An elevator recall Fire Alarm system will be integrated with Building 111's FA system from the new Parking Structure.

There are some utility (storm sewer, electric light pole service) relocations as a part of this project. There are WE Energies main electrical service feeds in the project vicinity, but at NO POINT should this project have to perform any main electric utility relocation work (already completed via separate contracts).  Significant geotechnical investigations have already been undertaken and are part of the contract documents. Warehouse Way will formally become a dead end right-of-way and will not intersect with Lincoln Drive.  There is minimal landscaping work on this project outside of a drainage swale and a storm-water retention basin north of the Parking Structure.

This structure is located in the sightlines of a National Historic Landmark District. The design of this Parking Structure was required to meet standards imposed by the National Park System, Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic Preservation.

The original Restricted Suite vehicles were awarded May 31, 2013 with a base period of two (2) years, one two (2) year option and one one (1) year option. The Period of Performance (PoP) for all contracts in both Suites will tentatively be extended through 30 May 2021. Each Small Business (SB) Prime was awarded a contract in both the Restricted and Unrestricted Suites. On-Ramp proposals shall be subject to the same proposal instructions and evaluation procedures as the SSES NexGen Request for Proposal (RFP) W15P7T-12-R-C005 dated 01 December 2011 and amendments thereto. Source selection will be conducted in the same manner as under the original SSES NexGen. (Note: Factor III Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) factor criteria will be on an acceptable/unacceptable basis and Factor 1 Technical Sample Tasks will be evaluated on a Pass/Fail basis. Past Performance factor evaluation for the source selection and subsequent task orders will be based on all recent and relevant performance (not just on SSES NexGen efforts). Every prime contractor awarded a contract is required to be able to perform any and all work as stated in the PWS at time of award of a task order (TO). The overall security requirement is TOP SECRET (TS) Facility Clearance/TOP SECRET Level of Safeguarding for the base IDIQ vehicle. For the purposes of On Ramp, proposals will only have to demonstrate the ability to obtain both TS Facility and Safeguarding Clearances. Businesses will not have to possess required clearances until TO award. The contractor shall require access to Communication Security (COMSEC) information, Secure Compartmental Information (SCI) and Non SCI Intelligence Information, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Foreign Government Information, For Official Use Only (FOUO) information and must be able to access Security/Program Classification Guide(s) (SCGs) and Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET). All awardees must meet these requirements. Individual TOs will be awarded at the proper security level, many at the SECRET level. The Government will NOT provide funding to construct/maintain a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). The awardees must maintain an office within 25 miles of Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), MD. The timeframe for On Ramp is anticipated to be in fiscal year 2016 (FY16). Efforts estimated at $8M and below will be set-aside for the Restricted Suite contractors. In order to be determined a small business concern under NAICS 541511, a business must not have more than an average of $27.5 million in annual receipts as defined in 13 C.F.R. &sect; 121.104. The minimum guaranteed award amount per contractor is $2,500.00. The Government may make approximately 5 small business awards and approximately 3 large business awards as determined by the contracting officer to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The PWS describes the services and support products that the SEC will provide to these and to other customers. The resulting contract shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision and other items and non-personal services necessary to satisfy the requirements as defined in this PWS. The awardee(s) shall perform to the standards in this contract and follow-on TOs. The contractor(s) working to satisfy the requirements of this PWS will provide engineering and technical services to the USACECOM SEC, its components and their successors. <br />Responses are limited to 10 one-sided pages, capable of being printed on 8.5 x 11 inch paper with one inch margins (top, bottom, left and right) and a 10 point Arial or 12 point Times New Roman font.

The JAGM AUR consists of a dual-mode guidance section mated to a HELLFIRE Romeo missile bus (warhead, control actuator system, rocket motor, and associated electronics). It will be used by joint service Rotary wing (RW), Fixed wing (FW) and Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) for destruction of high value stationary, moving, and relocatable land and naval targets from standoff range in day, night, adverse weather, and obscured battlefield conditions. JAGM will be compatible with all joint force and allied RW and UAS that are currently compatible with the HELLFIRE II missile. JAGM will use advanced seeker and guidance technologies combining multiple sensors to provide improved Precision Point and Fire and Forget targeting for capability against fast moving and stationary targets in dirty battlefield/countermeasure intensive environments and adverse weather.<br /><br />It is anticipated that the JAGM contractor will be required to deliver an average of 1,300 units per year starting in fiscal year 2020. At a minimum, the JAGM AUR or an equivalent Air-to-Ground missile must meet the requirements established in the following performance specifications and Interface Control Documents (ICDs):<br /><br />MIS-ICD-58351 - Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) Interface Control Document for the JAGM Guidance Section to Tactical Missile Bus
<p>MIS-ICD-58352 - Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) Launcher to JAGM Interface Control Document Volumes 1 and 2</p>
<p>MIS-ICD-58353 - Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) Interface Control Document for the JAGM Telemetry System</p>

<CONTACT>Cory L. Worley, Phone 3019753635, Email cory.worley@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a Dilution Refrigerator System to support nanoscale science research in the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) user facility.
<p><br />NIST has a requirement for a Dilution Refrigerator System to support scanning probe nanoscale science research at cryogenic temperatures in the CNST user facility. The system will be sited in the CNST NanoLab as a resource accessible to researchers in the CNST and to outside users via collaboration to measure a wide range of different materials at the nanoscale. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, and specifications developed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order for a Dilution Refrigerator System. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted&nbsp;may be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Measuring the properties of new nanostructured materials and devices is a critical part of the CNST mission. A very low noise, low vibration dilution refrigerator system is required to control the temperature and magnetic fields for a NIST custom designed and fabricated scanning probe microscope. Very sensitive measurements of atomic scale properties will be made at very low temperatures down to 10 mK (millikelvin) and in high magnetic fields. The measurement space for the scanning probe microscope (SPM) must be ultra-high vacuum (UHV), obtainable at room temperature. This type of measurement system requires a UHV compatible dilution refrigerator to obtain temperatures in the millikelvin range, and a superconducting magnet system to generate high magnetic fields. UHV compatibility requires all metal seals, of CF or VCR type, and a restriction of materials with low vapor pressure. The scanning probe microscope, which NIST is building, will be mounted on a platform connected to the dilution refrigerator in the inner vacuum can of the dilution refrigerator. The dilution refrigerator will have a central axis tube to allow the microscope module to be transferred from the top of the refrigerator to the magnet center in UHV. The dilution refrigerator and magnet system will be contained in a cryogenic vapor shielded Helium (He) dewar. The design of the system will emphasize, UHV, low noise, and low vibration operation suitable for scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy measurements. To fulfill this requirement, the dilution refrigerator system shall have the capability to provide low noise and low vibration operation for scanning probe microscopy at millikelvin temperatures and high magnetic fields.</p>
<p><br />NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 1,000 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture a Dilution Refrigerator System are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to cory.worley@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications, pricing, and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: <br />1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided. <br />2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). <br />3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. <br />4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to cory.worley@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). <br />5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice on behalf of the Chief of Naval Operations - OPNAV N3/N5 seeking information on potential firms qualified to provide services that address the changes associated with Chinas ascendance on the world stage by updating a prior report called Thinking Smarter about China, and Ourselves that was created in 2010 in order for N3/N5 to use that information to direct Navy stakeholders in engagement with China and the Peoples Liberation Army.  

This submission of information in response to this notice will assist the Government in identifying potential sources and determining if a competitive solicitation is appropriate.  A submission shall not be construed as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.
  Your response to this Sources Sought Notice will be treated as information only and part of market research and will not be shared outside of the Government.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor responses to this announcement.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.

The expected NAICS code for this procurement is 541990.  Any information submitted is voluntary.
It is requested that interested firms submit:
(1) The name, address, phone number, email address, and CAGE code of the firm; 
(2) A capabilities statement including a summary of their product/service (no more than 5 pages), 
(3) Their size status.
  

Please restrict all responses to non-proprietary information, and be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.  Responses are requested no later than 30 March 2016 at 1500 EST.  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail only to Pete Certo at peter.certo@navy.mil.

The scope and mandatory requirements are as follows:

The goal of this requirement shall have the contractor utilizing current information to incorporate a written update finalizing the Thinking Smarter about China, and Ourselves report updated for 2016 with documented actions from senior level working sessions in the form of an action plan for implementation.  The prior effort related to Thinking Smarter About China, and Ourselves identified gaps in the US Navys knowledge about China.
  The focus of the report and subsequent action plan is not to be predictive in nature and instead, provide a report and subsequent action plan shall provide organizational tactics that can be implemented today in an effort to better the US Navys strategic communication as the landscape has changed.  The primary methodology to finalize this report will be expert lead interviews with targeted US Government agencies, noteworthy experts on China, and facilitated working sessions with high-level government executives.

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers, Louisville District, is soliciting comments for the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for a large scale construction project (exceeding $25 million) in Hines, IL. The proposed project is for the construction of a new physical plant that will house four new boilers, each with a capacity of 35,000 Lbs/Hr Steam; and an emergency diesel engine generator (1 megawatt). The project will also include construction of the underground steam distribution system that services a multiple building campus (including a hospital) that must remain operational during construction. There are three main major tie-ins to the existing steam distribution system that must be accomplished during coordinated outages. The length of the underground steam distribution system is approximately 3,000 LF, contained in a concrete box culvert/conduit constructed in trenches as deep as 25 feet below grade routed through the campus between existing buildings, under roadways and under existing water lines, sewer lines, electrical lines and other underground utilities. The project will involve bringing on the system, commissioning and all associated controls. The building is comprised of approximately 2,500 gross square feet of basement, 18,000 gross square feet of ground floor and 4,500 gross square feet of mezzanine. Site improvements associated with the new physical plant include access drives off of Tripp Avenue and 5th Avenue, visitor and employee parking areas, truck dock(s), new perimeter security fencing, new fuel oil underground storage tanks (USTs), and a new partial underground water reservoir. The contract duration is anticipated at 730 calendar days.
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:</p>
<p>(a) Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will</p>
<p>(1) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>(2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to the Government, the Government request responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts in the Hines, IL area?<br />(2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor?<br />(3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br />(4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses?<br />(5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA?<br />(6) What is the cost impact to the bid due to a PLA?<br />(7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Louisville District contract?</p>
<p>Responses shall be submitted via email to Christina Burchett at Christina.m.burchett@usace.army.mil no later than 10:00 AM EDT 07 April 2016.<br />This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this survey.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">A U.S. Government investment of financial and technical resources to stimulate efforts within the private sector could aid in the accelerated development and demonstration of new space transportation capabilities - Ultra-Low Cost Access To Space (ULCATS) systems - that are at least an order of magnitude lower cost than today's existing launch systems, and at least one order of magnitude more reliable than today's systems. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A U.S. government partnership with industry might increase the amount of innovation and accelerate the development of ULCATS systems by commercial industry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These systems might create new methods for delivering payloads to low-Earth orbit (LEO) with dual use benefits to both commercial industry and U.S. government, including national security. As the U.S. Air Force stimulates private industry investments to provide assured access to space, we also are interested in the ideas for how to stimulate faster development of the next generation of commercial space launch systems.</span></p>

<DESC><p>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) Division has an urgent need for Gypsy Moth (+) Disparlure Pheromone Dispensers. The pheromone dispensers are used in traps to detect gypsy moth infestation outside of known infested areas. The USDA APHIS PPQ Division intends to issue a sole source, one-time purchase order to Scentry Biologicals, Inc. located in Billings, MT with an anticipated total price of $54000 under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). Scentry Biologicals is the only source having past experience with manufacturing these specific pheromone dispensers for USDA APHIS. The Scentry product does not require time-consuming first article testing. Because there is an anticipated ongoing need for this item, a solicitation for these pheromone dispensers will be posted at www.fbo.gov for a 5-year IDIQ contract sometime in the near future.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for a quote, and no formal solicitation for a purchase order will be issued. This notice is for informational purposes only. However, all interested parties may contact the Contract Specialist listed below. Anyone interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide an equivalent gypsy moth pheromone dispenser in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost.

<DESC><br />&nbsp;<br />The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)/ National Wildlife Center in Fort Collins, CO intends to award a sole source, Purchase Order to Vectronic Aerospace GmbH of Berlin, Germany for the purchase of 23 Vectronic Vertex Plus-2 collars (with VHF, Bi-directional Iridium, wireless UHF communication, mortality logger, and drop-off options) and a drop-off release transmitter.<br /><br />This procurement is being conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253( c )(1) <br />The property or services needed by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency. <br /><br />The USDA/APHIS/WS-National Wildlife Center currently own multiple collars (25) and base stations (40) of this same make and model and have access to feral swine already wearing same-model collars (30+) in several areas across the US. The ability to collect information on interactions among collared animals and visitation to sensitive sites such as nest of Endangered Species or entrances to domestic swine production facilities is invaluable and supports the purchase of devices capable and compatible of interaction with existing equipment.<br /><br />The Feral Swine Project of the USDA APHIS WS National Wildlife Research Center is responsible for many facets of research on ecology and damage of feral swine in the US. Due to the secretive nature of feral swine, devices such as GPS collars are a necessity for collecting important information on target species. Further, the acceptance of catching and then releasing a target and persecuted animal such as feral swine is often low to non-existent. To enable us to catch and release target individuals becomes acceptable when we are able to locate and target the animals real time via Iridium equipped GPS collars such as we are requesting. Lastly, this collar make and model proposed has the capability of interacting with like collars as well as stationary base stations enabling us to collect information on interactions among collared animals as well as visitation to precise locations on the landscape. This interaction capability is available from one other company; however, their devices cannot communicate with the collars and bait stations we have invested in to this point.
<p><br />This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored. However, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements it must furnish information about its products and services, as well as three (3) references from other customers who are using these services, to the Contracting Officer by 4:00pm. Mountian Time (MT) on the closing date of this notice. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. <br /><br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334220 - Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless&nbsp; Communications Equipment Manufacturing. The small business size standard is 750 Employees.</p>

<CONTACT>Matt Brown, Program Manager, Phone 443-395-1065, Email matthew.g.brown54.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><br />The United States Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005 on behalf of Program Manager (PM) Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT), intends to solicit and award a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) and Cost - no fee type, Performance-based contract with a 24 month base, plus two twelve (12) month options to Rockwell Collins, Inc. (RCI) 400 Collins Road NE, Cedar Rapids, IA. The anticipated place of performance is Cedar Rapids, IA and Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD.
<p>The proposed contract action is for software development and technical support for the software modification of the Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR) to provide Pseudolite interoperability, resiliency and software assurance. The DAGR collects and processes GPS satellite signals to provide Position, Velocity, and Time information, as well as position reporting and navigation capabilities. The DAGR is primarily a hand held unit with a built-in antenna, but can be installed in a host platform (ground facilities, air, sea, and land vehicles). Pseudolites are terrestrial and airborne deployed systems that transmit a signal similar to the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite signal. Pseudolite capable DAGR software is to be developed and tested in DAGR GPS receivers to evaluate the effectiveness of a currently fielded GPS device in conditions that require Assured PNT. The Army also requires Resiliency and Software Assurance Modification (RSAM) software updates to the DAGR to enhance the resiliency and functionality of GPS-dependent systems. The requirement includes software engineering to develop a RSAM to further improve legacy Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) DAGR products. Services include software studies, test planning and implementation, integrity checks, failure recovery analysis, software improvements, technical manual and training material updates as well as Technical Interchange Meetings. Market research has established that the Government's need cannot be met by a service customarily available in the marketplace, therefore, the Government does not intend to use Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 for the acquisition.</p>
<p>This purchase is intended as a single award, sole source contract in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>RCI has developed and maintains access to a proprietary DAGR software Technical Data Package (TDP), to include software source code, executables, and other SAASM artifacts which are necessary to update DAGR software. RCI is the Original Equipment Manufacturer. No other manufacturer has developed, produced or repaired the DAGR due to a lack of and the necessary rights to a software TDP. To award this contract to any source other than RCI, the Government would need to acquire the intellectual property rights to the DAGR to provide another source with the ability to comply with the above identified requirements. It is not in the Government's best interest to obtain the intellectual property rights. The Government does not currently own, or intend to obtain unlimited technical data rights for DAGR software.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. No costs shall be paid by the U.S. Government for submission of capability statements, proposals, or quotations, and the items submitted shall not be returned. The solicitation will not be posted on the FedBizOpps; however, it will be made available upon request to the points of contact (POCs) when it is available.</p>
<p>The closing date and time for this synopsis is 4:00 pm Eastern Daylight Time on 9 April 2016.</p>
<p>For questions regarding this purchase, please email the POCs indicated in FedBizOpps. Responses to this notice must be submitted in writing via email only.</p>

<DESC>QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS from DRAFT RFP POSTING W909MY-15-R-H001<br /><br />Questions are indicated by a black Q:<br />Answers are indicated by red A:
<p>Q: The only response deadline I see is October 12th, 2015. Is this correct? If it is, 3 weeks is not enough time for us to provide all of the documentation requested, and gather pricing. Possibly we are not clear on if any of this is needed now or when a non draft solicitation is released. Please confirm.</p>
<p>A: This information will only be required once the Solicitation is released.</p>
<p>Q: I may have overlooked areas as it relates to payment. Is there a payment schedule in place? For instance the first part is a 32 month project for the design, test, and evaluation; and then an option for 28 months to actually execute the TDP. I'm curious to the goals / milestones that need to be achieved before expense can begin to be recouped.</p>
<p>A: No payment schedule is planned, all funds will be placed on contract with the corresponding Delivery Order.</p>
<p>Q: List of Items, Schedule of Requirements, Scope of Work, Terms of Reference, Bill of Materials required.</p>
<p>A: These items will be includes in the solicitation posting.</p>
<p>Q: Soft Copy of the Tender Document through email.</p>
<p>A: The solicitation posting will include a downloadable pdf of the tender document</p>
<p>Q: Names of countries that will be eligible to participate in this tender.</p>
<p>A: Please see FAR Subpart 25.7 for Prohibited Sources.</p>
<p>Q: Information about the Tendering Procedure and Guidelines</p>
<p>A: Will be included in solicitation posting.</p>
<p>Q: Estimated Budget for this Purchase</p>
<p>A: The Government will not be disclosing the estimated budget at this time.</p>
<p>Q: Any Extension of Bidding Deadline?</p>
<p>A: Extension of bidding deadline may be granted depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>Q: For Past &amp; Present Performance Section: Will the Excel spreadsheet (Chapter 1: Past Performance - Summary of Relevant Contract Experience) of Volume IV be counted as one page or none? Are Excel spreadsheets considered to be a table and therefore not required to be font size 12? Can they be reduced to no smaller than 8 as noted for tables?</p>
<p>A: Excel spreadsheets will not be counted as pages. Excel spreadsheets are not considered as Tables. Tables are referring to PDF files.</p>
<p>Q: If a Contractor does not have any "Past Performance - Subcontracts" or any " Past Performance - Cure Notices / Show Cause" to address in Chapter 3 &amp; Chapter 4 respectively, is it required to include these chapters and say not applicable? If yes, will the one page for each then count against the 20 page limit?</p>
<p>A: Section L states next to the Chapter 4 instructions "if required" so no need to include chapter 4 if there is no New Corporate Entities to report. "Past Performance - Cure Notices/Show Cause" are included in Chapter 2 of the current solicitation Section L and will not need to be provided if there are none. Chapter 3 - Subcontracts still requires the Offeror to provide an outline of how the effort required by the identified past performance solicitation was assigned for performance within the contractors corporate entity, even if there are no subcontractors proposed.</p>
<p>Q: Which of the four files or is a fifth file permissible to include the "title page, a table of contents, and the body of the proposal".</p>
<p>A: Section L (2.A) states "Each volume shall consist of a title page, a table of contents, and the body of the proposal. The title page and table of contents will not be considered as part of the page count." Please place this information at the beginning of each volume.</p>
<p>Q: What is the basis of the 20 page count for the Past Performance section?</p>
<p>A: The Evaluation Team feels that 20 pages is sufficient to demonstrate Past Performance.</p>
<p>Q: Tie and Feeder Outputs: The Tie and Feeder outputs are legacy items from the original design of the PDCs being daisy-chained. With the use of the PSC there is no real need to use either the Tie or Feeder outputs. Is there any real requirement for the Tie and Feeders being necessary on the PDC or may they be excluded from the design? <br />A: The Government requirements are outlined in the PD and SOW.<br />&nbsp;<br />Q: Manual Operation: Manual operation of the generators still requires the DCS (engine/generator monitoring and protection functions) which in turn eliminates true manual operation. The inclusion of manual operation functionality just adds back in all the external switches and relays for the functions done in the DCS, thus paralleling the DCS and adding control panel complexity and operator interfacing. Can the manual functionality be "rolled" into the DCS? <br /><br />A: The Government requirements are outlined in the PD and SOW. It is up to the offerers how they implement the requirement<br /><br />Q: In paragraph 3.5.12.3.2 the paralleling cable length is 50 feet. However, in 3.7.2.1, the length is 25 feet. Which length is required? <br /><br />A: Length of the cable has been corrected in the PD <br /><br />Q: In paragraph 3.5.23.1 four output connectors are mentioned for each output (L1, L2, L3, N). That is true for the Tie Output. However, Feeder outputs are only 3-connector outputs. Are Neutrals now going to be required for the Feeder outputs? <br /><br />A: The PD has been updated to state the correct number of outputs <br /><br />Q: Hour Runtime Metering: In paragraph 3.5.12.2 there is a requirement for a resettable DCS runtime meter. In 3.5.12.2.4 there is a requirement for an external runtime meter that is resettable. If both displays are resettable, how is the operator to know actual total runtime hours on the engine? The DCS display can be resettable to match operational hours for the power unit. However, shouldn't the external "total engine runtime meter" be a non resettable meter? <br /><br />A: The Government requirements are outlined in the PD and SOW. <br /><br />Q: Section L, Table of Contents requires using the Table of Contents feature in MS Word.<br /><br />How will this work in sections that have both MS Word and MS Excel documents in the same section? Our concern is that it will throw off the TOC function.<br /><br />A: Every file that is built in MS Word must be submitted in PDF. So if the MS Excel file is not required as .xls per Section L 2.b Table 6, then the MS Excel file can be PDF as well and incorporated into the file.<br /><br />Q: When will the formal solicitation be issued? <br /><br />A: The formal solicitation will be released on FED BIZ OPS for release.<br /><br />Q: How many days are anticipated for completion of proposals after the solicitation is issued? <br /><br />A: The due date for the proposals will be listed on FED BIZ OPS. <br /><br />Q: Section B did not include range quantities for CLINs 1004 and 1005, should the ranges shown in<br />the example of Section M C. 2. b. (1) be used? ( 1 - 4, 5 - 19, 20 - 50) <br /><br />A: Documents have been updated to reflect the range quantities. <br /><br />Q: Will corrosion mitigation be listed as a separate CLIN due to the varying conditions of the GFE equipment? <br /><br />A: The SOW outlines the condition of the units, Offers should figure corrosion mitigation into their cost proposals. <br /><br />Q: The Extended warranty is not listed as a separate CLIN in Section B, should it be? <br /><br />A: Documents have been updated to reflect the extended warranty.<br /><br />Q: Paragraph 3.8.2.h states that we will need to complete control drawings for "off the shelf" items, however, Appendix C, section 5 the box next to Commercial Drawings is unmarked. Paragraph 3.8.2.h gives the impression that there should be an X in the box. Which is correct? <br /><br />A: The documents have been updated to reflect the change.<br /><br />Q: CDRL A023 calls for the development of the ETM in XML which we would have expected. However, CDRL A026 says "the contractor shall complete each Section, Chapter, Work Package IAW MIL-STD-40051 using .docx source files..." in other words Microsoft Word. Please confirm that the ETM should be developed in XML and not MS Word. <br /><br />A: The Government requires both XML and Word are required <br /><br />Q: CDRL A024, Block 16 reads "In Addition, one theory of operations system sample (.pdf and .docx source files) including narrative and supporting schematics, shall be included for the model of the generator set." Does that mean a narrative and a schematic for both the C and D variants should be supplied? <br /><br />A: The Government has updated the documents to reflect the change<br /><br />Q: Does the Government have operational logs for the current fielded MEP-PU-810A and MEP-PU-810B? If so can they be provided to offerors? <br /><br />A: The Government does not have operational logs, systems will be provided as FMC as outlined in the SOW. <br /><br />Q: Does the Government have Usage Reports for the current fielded MEP-PU-810A and MEP-PU-810B that are transmitted by the using units? If so can they be provided to offerors? <br /><br />A: The Government does not have usage reports, systems will be provided as FMC as outlined in the SOW. <br /><br />Q: PD 6115-0132 3.5.1 States Emissions requirements as EPA Tier 2 non road mobile minimum. This is an obsolete emission standard that manufacturers are not able to currently manufacture as of January 1, 2015. Tier 2 non road mobile emissions requirements for engines of that size have been superseded by EPA Tier 4 Final. However, manufacturers currently manufacture engines of this size at an emission standard of Tier 2 Stationary. Is an EPA Tier 2 Stationary Unit acceptable? Or, is the resulting equipment going be covered by a National Security Exemption? <br /><br />A: The Government intent is to obtain the required NSE wavier when required. <br /><br />Q: EPA certified engines are based on the use of ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel, and are run at 1800 RPM (60Hz). The requirements state engines must be able to use Grade 1-D, 2-D, JP-5, JP-8, Jet A fuel sources, which does not apply to EPA certified emissions products. Is it acceptable that the provided engine only be emission certified using ultra-low sulfur and run at 1800 RPM per the EPA certification standard? <br /><br />A: The offerors shall follow EPA guidance to obtain EPA certification for the engine they select. The engines/system shall operate on all fuels listed in the PD. Primary fuel is JP-8 <br /><br />Q: PD 6115-0132/2 TABLE II states that the Axle Load of the recapitalized MEP-PU-810B shall meet all DOT requirements for highway transport. The current MEP-PU-810B is certified for highway transport through state DOT waivers, is this an acceptable solution, or is the intent to propose an axle configuration change? <br /><br />A: The Government does not intend to direct an axle configuration change. Current Axle is acceptable as long as the system meets the weight requirements outlined in PD and SOW. <br /><br />Q: Which vehicle or vehicles will be used as the Prime Mover for the trailers once the C &amp; D models are fielded? <br /><br />A: Standard 915 trucks are currently on the MTOE of the 249th ENBN. <br /><br />Q: MIL-STD-3046 is called out in SOW paragraphs 3.5.4.2 and 3.5.4.3. The ASSIST database indicates that it was canceled on 6-1-15 with no superseding document. <br /><br />A: The Government has updated the documents to reflect the changes. <br /><br />Q: SOW paragraph 3.14.3.8 calls out FAR 52.210-7 which appears to be obsolete. Should it instead refer to 52.211-5 Material Requirements? <br /><br />A: The Government has updated the documents to reflect the change. <br /><br />Q: When completed do all the parts need to be the identical configuration? All A models need to be identical; all B models need to be identical.</p>
<p>A: All systems need to meet the requirements as outlined in the SOW and PD.</p>
<p>Q: Does the existing Rear Impact Guard meet DOT regulations?</p>
<p>A: It is the Governments understanding that it meets the DOT requirements</p>
<p>Q: What is the Contractor requirement (if any) for disposition of the removed engines, generators, and other ancillary components (i.e., tires, batteries, etc.)?</p>
<p>A: Disposition is in accordance with 3.14.3.8 and IAW state and local environmental requirements</p>
<p>Q: Will the Army ensure that hazardous fluids (diesel fuel, motor oil, transmission fluid, antifreeze, etc.) are drained and disposed of prior to making the existing units available for shipment from the Government site to the Contractor's facility?</p>
<p>A: The systems will be delivered in Fully Mission Capable (FMC) status as outline in SOW section 3.</p>
<p>Q: Does the page count limitation in Section L for Past Performance (20 pages) include the required Past Performance Questionnaire?</p>
<p>A: The questionnaire is included as part of the Past Performance page count.</p>
<p>Q: Section C paragraphs list data requirements by the Data Item Description (DID) number rather than their CDRL number. For example, DID DI-MISC-80711A is invoked by multiple CDRLs. Request that the Government identify the data requirements associated with SOW paragraphs by unique CDRL number rather than by Data Item Description.</p>
<p>A: The SOW identifies the data requirements for the for the recapitalization effort. <br /><br />Q: The requirements for the Performance Risk Assessment Questionnaire state that the questionnaires must be received within 14 calendar days of the release of the RFP. Request that the deadline is extended to the due date of the solicitation.</p>
<p>A: The Government has identified its requirements for the risk assessment.</p>
<p>Q: CDRL A023 Block 5 lists para 3.14.4.3.1. This paragraph does not exist in SOW.</p>
<p>A: The CDRL has been corrected to state paragraph 3.14.3.2 .</p>
<p>Q: CDRL A028 Block 5 lists para 3.14.8.8. This paragraph does not exist in SOW.</p>
<p>A: The CDRL has been corrected to 3.14.7</p>
<p>13. CDRL A028 para 3.14.8.1 lists DID DI-SESS-81874. This does not match block 5 of CDRL A028.</p>
<p>A: The CDRL has been updated.</p>
<p>Q: The RFP and attachments do not identify the locations of the existing units to be refurbished. Also, the required shipment location(s) for refurbished units is not identified. This would indicate that the Government will be responsible for delivering existing units to the Contractor refurbishment site and for shipping the new units to the required destinations. Please confirm that the Government is responsible for incoming and outgoing shipping of the PPUs, or provide specific locations so that the Contractor can establish shipping costs.</p>
<p>A: The SOW has been updated to reflect that the government shall be responsible for the movement of the units SOW 3.2.3.</p>
<p>Q: How can we obtain a copy of MIL-STD-2169 - High-Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) Environment?<br />A: All requests have to go to:</p>
<p>Defense Threat Reduction Agency, 8725 John J. Kingman Road, Stop 6201, Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060. The point of contact is Mr. Michael Rooney at michael.rooney@dtra.mil.</p>
<p>Questions on Purchase Description (PD) 6115-0132:</p>
<p>Q: Paragraphs 3.5.9.1 and 3.5.9.1.4 require the use of the Enduraseal VPI process on the generator windings. Enduraseal is a trademarked name with a limited vendor base and is usually used on generator and motor rewinds. If it is determined that a new generator would be more cost effective than a rewound SR4B - can the generator manufacturer's VPI process be used if it meets all of the performance and testing requirements stated in the PD and includes a 5-year warranty?</p>
<p>A: The alternators either new or rewound must meet the requirements as outlined in the PD and SOW.</p>
<p>Q: Since the current EPA requirement for off-road diesel engines is Tier IV, the use of a Tier II engine will require an emissions waiver. Is the Army going to obtain this waiver for the selected vendor?</p>
<p>A: The government's intent is to obtain the required NSE wavier if required. =</p>
<p>Q: The Statement of Work states that six (6) total MEP-810 (3ea "A" and 3ea "B") units will be used for the Design, Test and Evaluation phase. Paragraph 3.5.12.1.1 requires the ability to parallel up to sixteen (16) MEP-810 units. Does the Army envision that the Appendix D testing requirement for running a minimum of four (4) units in parallel is sufficient to prove the ability to run 16 units in parallel?</p>
<p>A: The government will accept verification by analysis during first article phase. 16 unit tests will be conducted during first production run. <br /><br />Q: Paragraph 3.5.29.1 a.197011 requires that the fuel tank capacity be 120 gals and also requires that the MEP 810 run for 2 hours at full load without refueling on this fuel. Preliminary calculations of the fuel consumption of candidate engines indicate that 120 gals of JP-8 may not be sufficient to run 2 hours. Can the capacity of the fuel tank be increased to meet the 2-hour requirement if required?</p>
<p>A: The offeror's may modify the system as required for their proposals to meet the requirements in the PD and SOW.</p>
<p>Q: Question on Purchase Description (PD) 6115-0132/1 and /2: Do the MEP-810A/B units currently meet the performance requirements of paragraphs 3.5 and 3.6 and sub-paragraphs?</p>
<p>A: The current engines in the DPGDS system are TIER I EPA compliant, so they do not meet the requirements of the PD and SOW.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO EXTEND SERVICES
<p>This announcement is a notice of intent to extend an existing contract on a sole source basis to TRAX International, LLC, 8337 West Sunset Rd, Ste. 250, Las Vegas, NV 89113-2200, for the Mission Support Services (MSS) contract at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico. The proposed contract action will extend the performance period of Contract W9124Q-07-C-0504 by fifteen months under the provisions of statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The estimated dollar value of this action is $92.9 million for the period of performance of 1 December 2016 through 28 February 2018.</p>
<p>The Government's intent is to extend the current services with TRAX in order to continue performance of the required services until the fully competitive follow-on contract can be solicited, negotiated, and awarded. Award to any other source at this time would negatively impact WSMR's ability to perform its mission. It would be impossible for any other contractor to perform all of the highly specialized services required for the MSS functions without causing an unacceptable delay in the performance of the mission and incurring an additional cost burden.</p>
<p>Comments should be submitted to the contracting office by email to:</p>
<p>Timothy.a.byrnes.civ@mail.mil, no later than 13 April 2016 at 4PM MST. Comments submitted for consideration of other methods will not be evaluated. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<CONTACT>Janet Paul, Contract Specialist, Phone 541-750-7120, Email JPAUL@FS.FED.US
<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest, intends to issue a sole source firm fixed price contract for J Herbert Stone Nursery (JHSN) Logix Refrigeration Control System Upgrade to: Logix-Controls (Kirkland, WA).
<p><br />The JHSN seedling cold storage facility was upgraded to an ammonia refrigeration system in 2000. The system is controlled by a Logix brand computerized system which includes hardware and software customized to run and monitor the six refrigerated rooms. The JHSN has not upgraded this Logix system since 2000 (even though there have been two significant upgrades over the last 16 years). To insure a catastrophic system failure does not occur, key reasons for the control system upgrade are:</p>
<p>&bull; The nursery stores plant materials valued at over $2,000,000 in our cold storage facilities. This is a perishable product that can be lost if our refrigeration system is not modern and reliable.<br />&bull; Age of the software. Two major upgrades did not occur. Our current system is not compatible with modern computer operating systems.<br />&bull; Failure of individual components which will be difficult to replace. The alarm system that notifies JHSN staff of system failures is currently unreliable placing our seedling crops at risk. The problem cannot be identified and replacement parts for the alarm components are not available.<br />&bull; Lack of technical support. Due to the age of our system our software is too old to trouble shoot remotely and they no longer program systems in the software language of our current system. The ability for Logix-Controls to remotely access the system for trouble shooting is essential in this complex system.</p>
<p>This action is taken pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.</p>

<p>***The sole source determination is based on the NOAA's NMFS Fisheries Ecology Division's requirement for a camera system able to capture clear (non-blurred) images of 1-2mm target species in both clear and highly turbid riverine and estuarine waters. The government determined that a limited number of vendors were/are available but none possessed the capability to provide the required image resolution in both clear and turbid water conditions. The government participated in a national level "Recovery Challenge" that solicited input from both citizens and vendors and a review panel determined that none of the applicants met the requirements for image quality and resolution under a range of water turbidity conditions. The Government field tested a prototype of UCSD's camera system with exceptional results.</p>
<p>UCSD SPC2 Camera meets the technical requirements stated below:<br />&bull; Camera - 9 MP USB 3.0 Color Point Grey Grashopper 3<br />&bull; Imaging Lens - 0.508X, 1&Prime; Format Telecentric Lens<br />&bull; Illumination - Pulsed White LED, Darkfield<br />&bull; Exposure Time - 10 to 60 &mu;s<br />&bull; Field of View - 2.5 cm x 2.0 cm<br />&bull; Pixel Size (Object Space) - 7.4 &mu;m<br />&bull; Optical Resolution - 32 lp/mm @ 30% contrast<br />&bull; Depth of Field - 400 &mu;m @ 32 lp/mm @ 20% contrast<br />&bull; High-Resolution Imaged Volume - 0.2 mL<br />&bull; Blob-Detection Imaged Volume - Up to 10 mL<br />&bull; Embedded System - 1.8 GHz Big-Little Quad Core ODROID-XU3, 2 GB RAM<br />&bull; Image Processing - OpenCV<br />***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.

Contractor: Significance, Inc.<br />16. Description:
<p>Marine Corps Installations Command (MCICOM HQ) Contracting Department intends to negotiate with and potentially award a contract under the Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business (EDWOSB) Program sole-source authority. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 15 U.S.C. Section 637(m), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.1506, Women-Owned Small Business Program Sole Source Awards, and recognized as a statute that expressly authorizes or requires that acquisition to be made from a specified source in FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute. This Statute expressly authorizes acquisitions to be made under the WOSB program.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide financial execution, data management, analysis, reporting and audit support in support of Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC), Deputy Commandant, Programs and Resources (DC P&amp;R) Budget and Execution (B&amp;E) Division. There will be three CLINs for three separate task areas for each period of performance. The first task area is financial execution level data management, analysis and reporting; the second task area is civilian personnel management and tracking; and the third task area is field level execution monitoring, corrections and audit support. Specific expertise is required for all three task areas including: USMC's accounting system (SABRS) and reporting system (SMARTS); program budget information system (PBIS); work year personnel cost (WYPC) and programming budget development database; as well as expertise in DoD and Marine Corps financial processes, issues, and accounting systems related to coding, structure and standardization.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this requirement is for a one-year base period and four (4) one-year option periods.</p>
<p>This requirement will be fulfilled through a firm-fixed-price Order.</p>
<p>This procurement is a commercial acquisition using FAR Subpart 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items.</p>
<p>17. Place of Contract Performance: Work shall be conducted at HQMC, DC P&amp;R B&amp;E spaces loated in the Pentagon. <br />18. Set-aside Status: This is a sole source direct award to an Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business under the 8(m) program.<br />19. Rationale for Small Business Strategy: After reviewing the results of a Request For Information as well as additional Market Research performed, FAR Subpart 19.203 (Relationship Among Small Business Programs) was reviewed for guidance. FAR19.203(c) states that the contracting officer shall first consider an acquisition for the small business socioeconomic contracting programs before considering a small business set-aside. This is further echoed in FAR 19.1506(a), which states that a contracting officer shall consider a contract award to an EDWOSB concern on a sole source basis before considering small business set-asides. While there are other large or small businesses that may be capable and interested in this requirement, in accordance with FAR 19.203 (Relationship Among Small Business Programs), there is no order of precedence among the various socioeconomic contracting programs and the Government should consider the market research and agency progress in fulfilling small business goals in making its decision on which program to utilize. The Government has taken both of those into consideration in its decision to utilize the authority at FAR 19.1506 to contract with an EDWOSB for this requirement. The Small Business Specialist concurred with this determination on 14 March 2016.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-87, DAC 91-13, and Defense Publication Notice (DPN) 20160226. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested and a written request for quotation (RFQ) will not be issued. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of amendments (if any).

<p>Offerors are requested to provide pricing for 33 units. It is anticipated that 10 units will be purchased in FY16 with a FY17 option for up to 10 units and FY18 option for up to 13 units. The best estimate is that a total of 33 units will be ordered, however, there is no guarantee that an option will be exercised.</p>
<p>Products offered shall be commercially available. Items proposed shall be new units. Reconditioned, remanufactured, or used items are not acceptable and shall not be proposed.<br />The units must meet the requirements of Purchase Description 16M-282A-PR, dated 09 June 2015, with a standard warranty and data in accordance with DD Form 1423. The Purchase Description and requirements for data delivery on the contract data requirements list are available for download at this site. Please review ALL documents carefully</p>
<p>Delivery of a minimum of one (1), maximum of four (4) units will be direct shipped to designated Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories (PMELs) located throughout the U.S. (see listing of anticipated delivery locations posted at this site) 90 days after receipt of award notification. Delivery of units will continue at this rate every thirty days thereafter until all deliveries are complete. No less than one and no more than four production units may be delivered at one time. Production units will undergo a 15 day kind, condition, and count acceptance when the units are received at delivery destination. Accelerated deliveries are not permitted unless authorized by the Contracting Officer. All deliveries shall be FOB destination. <br />Quantities under the option years may be exercised contingent upon the availability of funds. Should option quantities be exercised, delivery of exercised units will begin 30 days after completion of CLIN 0001 Production Units or begin 90 days after exercise of option, whichever is later, with delivery being no less than one unit and no more than four units delivered at one time.</p>
<p>Invoices may not be submitted in Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) through Invoicing, Receipt, Acceptance, and Property Transfer (iRAPT) until the units have been accepted.

<p>NOTICE TO OFFERORS: Funds are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date for receipt of offers. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs incurred.</p>
<p>The current versions of the following provisions and clauses, both by reference or full text, apply to this acquisition and are incorporated herein:</p>
<p>FAR 52.203-3 Gratuities;<br />FAR 52.203-6 Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government, with Alternate I;<br />FAR 52.204-10 Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards;<br />FAR 52.209-6 Protecting the Governments Interest When Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment;<br />FAR 52.209-10 Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations;<br />FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items;</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 "Evaluation--Commercial Items - (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:" 1. Technical. Capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirements as stated in the purchase description; and 2. Price. Award will be based on technical acceptability (acceptable or not acceptable) and then lowest total evaluated price. Technical acceptability will be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in response to this request for quotation. Technical Tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. All offeror's shall provide with their proposal: descriptive literature, brochures, and a technical proposal response. Offerors must submit sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc., in order for the Government to make an adequate technical assessment of the proposed unit. The technical proposal response MUST include a written line-by-line response to each paragraph number of the purchase description and provide sufficient supporting technical literature. Solely restating the paragraphs of the purchase description or limiting the response to a simple statement of compliance is not acceptable. Where the technical literature demonstrates that the proposed unit meets the requirement of a specific purchase description paragraph, you may reference that page and paragraph of the technical literature in your technical response in lieu of restating it.</p>
<p>The total evaluated price will be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) On the basic year, the evaluated price will be the unit price proposed multiplied by the specified unit quantity (e.g. 2 EACH).</p>
<p>(2) For the option years, the evaluated price will be the unit price proposed multiplied by the maximum quantity available on the Option CLIN. Offeror's are advised that the evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options.</p>
<p>(3) The sum of all CLINs (Basic Year and Options) will represent the total evaluated price.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, with Alternate I. Each offeror shall include a completed copy of this provision.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:" 1. Technical. Capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirements as stated in the purchase description; and 2. Price. Award will be based on technical acceptability (acceptable or not acceptable) and then lowest total evaluated price. Technical acceptability will be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in response to this request for quotation. Technical Tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. All offerors shall provide with their proposal: descriptive literature, brochures, and a technical proposal response. Offerors must submit sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc., in order for the Government to make an adequate technical assessment of the proposed unit. The technical proposal response MUST include a written line-by-line response to each paragraph number of the purchase description and provide sufficient supporting technical literature.

Where the technical literature demonstrates that the proposed unit meets the requirement of a specific purchase description paragraph, you may reference that page and paragraph of the technical literature in your technical response in lieu of restating it.</p>
<p>The total evaluated price will be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) On the basic year, the evaluated price will be the unit price proposed multiplied by the specified unit quantity (e.g. 2 EACH).</p>
<p>(2) For the option years, the evaluated price will be the unit price proposed multiplied by the maximum quantity available on the Option CLIN. Offerors are advised that the evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options.</p>

<DESC>This notice is a synopsis for a proposed contract action to Contract W52P1J-10-C-0062 (Kuwait Base Operation and Security Support Services (K-BOSSS)) that the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations and a solicitation will not be issued for this requirement.
<p>The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island intends to award a modification to extend the existing contract W52P1J-10-C-0062 for the period of 29 March 2016 to 28 December 2016 with an evaluated option of 29 December 2106 through 28 March 2017 in accordance with FAR clause FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements to Vectrus Systems Corporation (Vectrus). The contract period of period of performance was initially for a base year plus four option periods. FAR clause 52.217-8 was exercised for period of 29 September 2015 and will end on 28 March 2016.</p>
<p>The initial solicitation W52P1J-09-R-0065 was originally synopsized May 5, 2009 as well as the original issuance of the contract W52P1J-10-C-0062 effective 29 September 2010, synopsized 04 October 2010. The option to extend services under FAR clause 52.217-8 was synopsized on 23 June 2015. The expected modification date for the current contract for the extension is no later than 28 March 2016, effective 29 March 2016.</p>
<p>The nine month extension is intended to be awarded to Vectrus under FAR 6.302-1 when it is likely that award to any other source would result in (A) substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and (B) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. A full and open competition is underway for the follow-on to the K-BOSSS contract and the solicitation has been posted to FedBizOps.</p>
<p>The proposed modification will continue critical base operations support and security support services throughout the Kuwait area of responsibility (AOR) including forms, publications, and reproductive services; Army postal operations; operations; logistics; information management; public works; environmental services; medical administrative support; installation services; security services; fire services; and emergency services.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. A determination not to compete this requirement, based on responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this synopsis. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis. Responses to this notice are due by 1600 Central Time, 07 April 2016. Email inquiries and/or responses to Benjamin Geringer, Contract Specialist, at benjamin.l.geringer.civ@mail.mil.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secure Documents</span> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Several documents related to this solicitation will be posted as "secured" in the FedBizOpps website. Please find below instructions to access secured documents in FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Instructions for access to the FBO Secure Site:</p>
<p>&nbsp;To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in the Federal Business Opportunity ("FedBizOpps" or "FBO") system, offerors must:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Please note that SAM has replaced the previous system Central Contractor Registration (CCR). If an entity was previously registered in CRR the information should have transferred into SAM. You just need to set up a SAM account and migrate your CCR roles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Once registered in SAM, go to the FBO website at www.fbo.gov <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/">https://www.fbo.gov/</a> and log in. Verify your registration within the FBO system. The FBO Vendor Guide is available at https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf &lt;https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf&gt; to provide assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3. Once your SAM registration is verified in the FBO system, click on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD2345 - Military Critical Technical Data Agreement Form. You can also find the DD2345 at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf &lt;http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf&gt;- . Fill out the DD2345 form and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on the form. JCP will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date within five days of receipt. Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect. Additionally, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4. Once you receive the approved DD2345 form from JCP and have verified your status on the JCP website, <a href="http://www.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/jcp/search.aspx">http://www.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/jcp/search.aspx</a>, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link. The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN. The MPIN number is a mandatory data element created by the CCR registrant and must have nine characters: at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number. No spaces or special characters are permitted. It allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also serves as a validation to access sensitive but unclassified documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;5. Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors will submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button. Once vendors request explicit access, the FBO system will send notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, who will approve the request in the system. Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system, and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.</p>

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>6. General Quote Preparation Instructions</p>
<p>Information requested within this RFQ shall be furnished in writing, shall be prepared in accordance with the instructions provided, and shall conform to all aspects of this RFQ. To aid in evaluation, submitted responses shall be clearly and concisely written, as well as being neat, indexed and logically assembled.</p>
<p>The information requested and the manner of submittal is essential to permit prompt evaluation of all quotations on a fair and uniform basis. Accordingly, any response in which material information requested is not furnished, or where indirect or incomplete answers or information are provided, may be considered unacceptable for evaluation.</p>
<p>The following introductory information (letter format is acceptable) is required on the first page of your quote:</p>
<p>1. RFQ Number &amp; Title,<br />2. Name and address of vendor,<br />3. Name, telephone number &amp; e-mail address of main point-of-contact,<br />4.

Each quoter's written technical submission will be reviewed and evaluated on an adjectival basis, for each of the technical evaluation factors. Simple statements of compliance/reiteration (i.e., "understood"; "will comply"), without a detailed description of how compliance will be met, may not sufficiently demonstrate a quoter's ability to meet the technical requirements and may result in a rating of "fail". Technical evaluations will be conducted using the adjectival ratings and definitions provided below.</p>
<p>(End of Addendum)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The Government will evaluate offers in response to this request in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 procedures.</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible responder whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Technical Capability.</p>
<p>Technical and past performances, when combined, are of equal importance to price. Written responses for this section will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria listed below. These factors will be evaluated as pass/fail past performance and price will not be evaluated if the vendor fails this area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Factor 1. Compliance with standard maintenance coverage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Factor 2. Vendor must be an authorized re-seller for Adaptive Computing. Documentation showing authorization must be included.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Price.</p>
<p>Price will not be scored or rated. Evaluation of price will be performed using one or more of the price analysis techniques in FAR 13.106. Through these techniques the Government will determine whether prices are reasonable and complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) Past Performance.<br /><br />As part of past performance evaluation, Past Performance will be evaluated using recent and relevant information obtained from the references provided by the responder as well as past performance information independently obtained by the Government. Past Performance will be evaluated and given of rating of "Acceptable", or "Unacceptable" as defined below. Recent and relevant Past Performance is defined in Addendum to FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, paragraph 2.b.</p>
<p>(b) Options. N/A</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quotation, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful responder within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quotation (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(d) Rating Definitions.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions of Ratings for Technical Capability:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pass.</span> Quote meets or exceeds all specified requirements, demonstrates an acceptable understanding of the requirement, and proposes a sound, practical, and feasible approach to accomplish the requirements of the Statement of Work.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fail.</span> Quote does not meet requirements, has not demonstrated an adequate approach, or does not demonstrate an acceptable understanding of the requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions of Ratings for Past Performance:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acceptable.</span> Based on the responder's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the responder will successfully perform the required effort, or the responder's performance record is unknown.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unacceptable.</span> Based on the responder's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the responder will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Neutral</span>. No relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance rating. A search was unable to identify any relevant past performance information for the quoter or key team members/subcontractors or their key personnel. This is neither a negative or positive assessment.</p>

<p><br /><strong>STATEMENT OF WORK</strong></p>
<p>WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION <br />PREVAILING WAGE SEMINAR<br />Charlotte, North Carolina</p>
<p><br />PART 1<br />GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p><br />1. GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p><br />The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) Prevailing Wage Seminars (Prevailing Wage Seminars) are three-day compliance trainings designed for regional stakeholders (unions, private contractors, state agencies, federal agencies and workers). The compliance training provided has proven to be an essential force multiplier for WHD's enforcement efforts and stakeholder education.</p>
<p>Prevailing Wage Seminars are emblematic of WHD's enhanced commitment to prevailing wage enforcement. Seminars have significantly enhanced communication and collaboration with some of our most important stakeholders, such as the building trades labor organizations and contractors that have millions of dollars in government contracts. Our increased enforcement has also significantly elevated interest and attendance by state and federal contracting agencies. Previous seminars have averaged more than 300 attendees from the city where the seminar is held and from surrounding states and further. Prevailing Wage Seminars have proven a valuable tool in promoting and enhancing WHD's government contracts strategic prevailing wage enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>In addition, Prevailing Wage Seminars are a mission critical component of WHD's overall enforcement strategy. WHD believes that providing contractors and contracting agency staff with compliance assistance training prior to contract award significantly reduces unintentional errors and permits WHD to target its limited enforcement resources on the egregious violators.</p>

<DESC>This position serves with the Education Team with particular focus on USAID/Senegal's Early Grade Reading (EGR) Project, due to begin implementation in 2016. The incumbent will provide technical expertise and managerial support to the Education Team, and will serve as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) for the principal award under the EGR Project, with an expected value of around $74 million. The Education Officer will also oversee the development and management of additional activities that support the EGR Project goals. The incumbent will report directly to the Education Team Leader and will lead a small sub-team within the Education Team to implement all components of the ERG Project. The ideal candidate will therefore have a combination of strong managerial skills, a background in primary education development in an international setting, and experience in cross-sectoral collaboration and building successful programs that contribute to resolving complex education development issues.
<p>The EGR Project is designed to ensure delivery of high-quality reading instruction to approximately half of Senegal's primary schools, while strengthening national and regional capacity to provide sustainable, quality early grade reading interventions. Key areas of intervention include the development of evidence-based reading programming (e.g. standards-driven early grade reading materials, teachers' guides, coaching tools, and assessment instruments), support for reading-focused policy development and systems strengthening in the Ministry of Education, and support for increased community demand for and engagement in reading. These chosen outputs and areas of intervention are based on a series of analyses carried out by USAID and its partners over several years. As a result of these interventions, Senegal will benefit from:</p>
<p>&bull; Increased materials of better quality for early grade reading instruction;<br />&bull; Classroom instruction that follows international best practice in reading and that is supported through intensive coaching and supervision; <br />&bull; A stronger, more coherent, research-based standards framework for early grade reading; and <br />&bull; Parents, communities, and religious associations able to use the tools and training with which they have been provided to reinforce and enhance their children's reading success.</p>
<p>The EGR Project consists of a defined set of activities, which the team plans to implement through a variety of contract and grant mechanisms, including Government-to-Government (G2G) support.</p>
<p>The five-year Project is estimated to begin in late FY 2016 and is designed to contribute to USAID/Senegal's 2012-2017 Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) and update; specifically, Development Objective 3, which seeks to increase effective citizen participation through better educated children and youth. The project directly contributes to the achievement of Goal 1 of the USAID Education Strategy that aims to improve reading skills for 100 million children in the primary grades. It is also designed to support the Government of Senegal's (GOS) 2013-2025 education sector strategy.</p>
<p>The Education Team manages a portfolio with an annual funding level of approximately $18M, spanning Goals 1 and 3 of the USAID Education Strategy. The Education Team is a leading force in the local education donor community and benefits from a close and highly productive relationship with the Ministry of Education. The Senegal Mission is at the forefront of Local Solutions, and the Education Team is deeply engaged in capacity building efforts with local organizations and has been working through G2G agreements since 2007.</p>
<p>The Education Team will simultaneously oversee the launch of another large project aimed at increasing access to education for students in conflict zones. Although the incumbent of this position will not be directly responsible for management of the Access project, there will be important opportunities for collaboration and synchronization.</p>
<p>In the area of project management, the incumbent will be responsible for ensuring the achievement of results and will mentor and foster the leadership of local staff and their capabilities and expertise in order to most effectively reach program objectives. S/he will be expected to represent USAID/Senegal at various forums to present USG technical and policy positions. This will include regular meetings with senior and mid-level host government officials, representatives of various national and regional institutions and organizations, other donors, local actors in education, U.S. Embassy officials and other USG agencies.</p>
<p>Although the incumbent's principal focus will be on the Early Grade Reading Project, it is expected that he or she will contribute to the management of all activities and tasks in the portfolio, as needed and appropriate.</p>

<DESC><p>This requirement was originally synopsized under Pre-Solicitation Notice EQWPGC-15-5003 on Jan. 25, 2016 . Contained herein are Phase I - RFQ documents to be used for submission of a Technical Proposal, per the RFQ.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) hereby notifies of the intent to procure for the Design/Build contract for the CENTRAL UTILITY PLANT (CUP) II for the Consolidation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at the St. Elizabeths Hospital site in Anacostia, DC. The scope will include design/build efforts from approximately 30% bridging documents and construction management for the CUP II Building. <br /><br />The St Elizabeths site is approximately 176 acres and is a National Historic Landmark (NHL) site containing primarily office space and parking structures with some special buildings for conferences and food service. The site, located one mile east of DC on Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, SE, is the former St. Elizabeths Hospital site in Anacostia, Washington, DC. Three phases are planned in total, with a phasing summary as follows: Phase 1 - new construction for the U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters (USCG) (1,179,500 gsf) [awarded September 2009] Adaptive reuse of historic buildings for DHS at 179,250 gsf; Phase 2 - The Center Building for DHS, Central Utility Plant and DHS Operations Center, a mix of new construction and adaptive reuse projects along with FEMA Headquarters at 1.7 million gsf and Phase 3 - a combination adaptive reuse and new construction for Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and DHS (1,398,150 gsf).<br /><br />The Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Central Utility Plant Expansion (CUP2) project at St. Elizabeths is a follow-up project to work completed during Phase 1 development of the campus. The Phase 1 Central Utility Plant, constructed to support the US Coast Guard Headquarters (Munro Building), is an existing two story below grade structure with an above grade "head house" utilized for equipment and personnel access. The upper (LL1) level is dedicated to electrical systems, consisting of emergency generators and switch gear, the lower (LL2) level contains boilers, chillers, and fuel storage for the emergency generators, as well as office space for operations personnel. The CUP1 and a temporary Modular Utility Plant (MUP) are sized to accommodate only the portions of campus built out during Phase 1- the Douglas A. Munro USCG Headquarters, portions of the Departmental Operations Center A (DOC A), and Buildings 31, 33, 40, 41, 48, and 49. In order for the next phase (Phase 2A) of campus construction to be brought on line, the Central Utility Plant must be expanded to accommodate this additional area. These next phases include the Center Building Complex, the West Addition, and additional build-out space within DOC A. Ideally, the CUP2 would be operational not only in time for occupancy of these buildings, but in time to condition these building sites for interior construction, thereby saving costs for temporary air handling units. The CUP2 building is planned to accommodate the remaining equipment needed for the campus build out.<br /><br />This procurement is being conducted using the two phase selection process found in FAR 36.3. Qualification proposals will be evaluated in Phase 1 to determine which offerors will submit proposals for Phase 2. One contract will be awarded using competitive negotiation. In Phase 1, GSA will select a short list of the most highly qualified offerors and request that those offerors submit Phase 2 proposals. All responsible sources may submit a Phase 1 proposal. A maximum of 5 firms will be selected to submit Phase 2 proposals. Only those selected offerors are authorized to submit Phase 2 proposals. Those offerors not selected for participation in Phase 2 will be notified in accordance with FAR 15.503(a). In Phase 2, Offerors may submit a price proposal subject to the Project Labor Agreement (PLA) requirements set forth in the Phase 2 solicitation (a PLA proposal), a price proposal not subject to the PLA requirements set forth in the Phase 2 solicitation, or both. Any price proposal submitted in Phase 2 shall clearly identify whether it is subject to such PLA requirements.</p>
<p>The estimated price range for the Project is between $30 and $40 Million. Liquidated Damages shall be $ 3,000 per calendar day. Substantial Completion is within 540 calendar days from issuance of Notice to Proceed (NTP); Contract Completion is within 60 calendar days of Substantial Completion. NAICS Code: 236220. <br /><br />The Contractor (if not a small business concern), shall be required to present an acceptable small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and woman-owned small business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with Public Law 95-507 as part of its proposal. <br /><br />All information, amendments and questions concerning this solicitation will be electronically posted at the following web page: http://www.fbo.gov. The General Services Administration will only make this RFP available electronically at www.FBO.gov. This site provides instructions for downloading the documents. All inquiries must be in writing, preferable via email to the person(s) specified in the solicitation. All answers will be provided in writing and will be available on the aforementioned FBO posting.<br /><br />All responsible firms may submit an offer. This is a competitive negotiated acquisition governed by procedures in FAR 15. Proposals (Technical and Price) will be evaluated by the Government using source selection procedures per FAR Subpart 15.3. Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted. The Government may make an award without discussions. Therefore, offerors will be requested to submit initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint. Proposal submission instructions will be included under the RFP.<br /><br />All qualified responsible firms are encouraged to participate in this procurement. Small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate as prime contractors, or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses. All responsible sources may submit a proposal package, which will be considered by the agency.<br /><br />Interested firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Firms can register via the Internet site at https://www.sam.gov or by contacting the SAM Service Desk at http://www.fds.gov. Interested firms are required to submit their representations and certifications through the SAM website.<br /><br />Offerors will not be reimbursed for proposal submittal expenses.<br /><br />INTERESTED PARTIES ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF ACTIONS INCLUDING POSTING OF ANY AMENDMENTS. HOWEVER, OFFERORS ARE ADVISED TO CHECK THE SIGHT FREQUENTLY AS THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING AMENDMENTS.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: The official solicitation package and technical specifications will be located on the official government web page and the Government is not liable for information furnished by any other source. Amendments, if/when issued will be posted to the FBO site for electronic downloading. This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments prior to closing; therefore, it is the offeror's responsibility to check the website periodically for any amendments to the solicitation.

 Place of Performance
Address:	400 Fort Hill Avenue, Canandaigua, NY
Postal Code:	14424-1159 
Country:	UNITED STATES

Award shall be made to the quoter whose quotation is the lowest price technically acceptable to the government. The government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: (1) Technical acceptability (2) Past performance, and (3) Price".  
  (a)  In accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

1. Technical acceptability
2. Past performance
3. Price
 

  Technical acceptability and Past performance, when combined, are significantly less important than price.

The LPTA evaluation process will be accomplished as follows: 

(1) Technical Acceptability:  Each offeror's technical quotations will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach that meets the requirements of the Scope of Work Items B and C and demonstrates a thorough knowledge and understanding of those requirements. 

An evaluation rating of Technically Acceptable / Non-Acceptable will be assigned upon completion of the technical quotations evaluation. If an Offeror receives a technical rating of "Non-Acceptable" they will not be considered for award. 

Offerors shall document their company's ability to service the system on a 24/7 basis within two (2) hours of emergency notification by the Canandaigua VAMC. 

(2) Past Performance:  

Evaluation criteria: Offeror's past performance record demonstrates satisfactory performance on at least three projects (within the past 3 years) similar in scope to the work described in this Request for Quotation. Any proposal which does not demonstrate satisfactory performance on at least three projects (within the past 3 years) similar in scope to the work described in this solicitation will not be considered technically acceptable.  Offerors shall have their references complete the attached Past Performance survey and those references shall email the survey directly to richard.williams18@.va.gov. 




Acceptability Standard (Pass):

Past performance surveys must reflect that work performed in the past three (3) years was satisfactory or better, as well as indicate a specific rating of satisfactory or better on meeting the maintenance schedule.

NOTE: An offeror without relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available, will be given a neutral rating.

(3) Price Quotations:   Quotations shall be evaluated, for award purposes, based upon the total price proposed for the basic requirements (basic award) and all options.  The sum of all the CLINs (Basic Year and options) will represent the total evaluated price. Offerors are advised that the evaluation of options shall not obligate the government to exercise such options.

Note: Unrealistically low proposed prices or cost estimates, initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a quotation from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand or the offeror has submitted unrealistic quotations.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU) is the Nation's federal health sciences university and is committed to excellence in military medicine and public health during peace and war. We provide the Nation with health professionals dedicated to career service in the Department of Defense and the United States Public Health Service and with scientists who serve the common good. We serve the uniformed services and the Nation as an outstanding academic health sciences center with a worldwide perspective for education, research, service, and consultation; we are unique in relating these activities to military medicine, disaster medicine, and military medical readiness. USU is located in Bethesda, MD on the grounds of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda.<br /><br />USU intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Assessment Technologies Institute, L.L.C., located in Leawood, Kansas for the renewal of site licenses for 1360 students/trainees to E*Value software for one year.<br /><br />These licenses will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12-Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures.<br /><br />Sole source determination is made in accordance with:<br /><br />FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition<br /><br />(b) Soliciting from a single source<br /><br />(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.<br /><br />The mission of USU is to provide the highest quality education programs in the health sciences to those selected individuals who demonstrate dedication to a health profession career in the Uniformed Services.  As such, it is essential USU provide the necessary training and equipment required for our students to become successful doctors and nurses and to be able to provide the best care possible for our soldiers and to support our research efforts. <br /> <br />Assessment Technologies Institute owns MedHub, which is the sole provider of access to their proprietary software E*Value. The software is necessary because the entire university already uses this software to track and evaluate progress of students/trainees. For consistency of records, it is imperative that we continue to use the same software that has been in use for at least the past nine (9) years. Also, the use of this system is based on the premier functionalities that would assist in meeting the ACGME guidelines for the GME/NCC programs. This online evaluation management system will ensure that our Program Directors will be in compliance and meet accreditation requirements as set forth by the Accreditation Council Graduate Medical Education (ACGME).
<p>Specific ACGME guidelines to which NCC GME programs must adhere include establishing and maintaining 1) a system for scheduling and monitoring resident duty hours in the learning environment in order to mitigate excessive service demands and fatigue, and 2) the ability for programs to collect, maintain and track the thousands of evaluations from the multitude of internal and external didactic rotations trainees as a whole must complete as part of their program curriculum and individually in order to graduate.  For the past 9 years E*Value has been highly effective in providing the means by which the NCC has been able to comply with these requirements. The NCC has now reached a level of unprecedented system standardization which has greatly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of their ability to manage their GME programs and provide institutional oversight as required by the ACGME.  In addition, E*Value is now the repository for 9 years of historical data that may be arduous and costly, if not impossible, to extract in mass.  Lastly, E*Value has a proven track record of providing the required services with sound technical support.</p>
<p>Assessment Technologies Institute is the only know source that can provided the requested equipment.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued.  Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide the above-mentioned requirement as specified.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government.  Responses must be received via email (pierre.smith@usuhs.edu) by 3:00 p.m. EST on April 4, 2016.</p>

12. Description:

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-16-Q-200013 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-87 effective 16 March 2016.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Thales Avionics (Cage Code: 3J0E6) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation for the following parts:

AIR DATA UNIT
P/N: C17133AA01
NSN: 6610-14-564-1020
QTY: 5 EA
MFGCD: F9111
RDD: 6/22/2016

All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Thales Avionics (Cage Code F9111).  Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 15 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Program Manager is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Regional Teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, DC. OTI currently has five regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division: Afghanistan/Pakistan (AF/PAK), Eurasia and Asia (E&amp;A), Middle East (ME), Africa (AFR), and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). OTI's regional teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.  OTI/Washington staff provides administrative and programmatic support for OTI programs in close coordination with field staff.</p>
<p>The Program Manager's principal responsibility is to assist one of OTI's regional teams in the administration and management of existing country programs and participates in new country program assessments as the need arises. This is a program-funded USPSC position, which OTI anticipates will focus approximately 80% of the time on country program implementation support, and approximately 20% of the time supporting strategic planning and program development. The Program Manager must have a strong interest in assisting countries in transition and be able to accomplish a wide range of administrative functions (budget and financial preparation and management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success. Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change. The successful candidate will demonstrate sound judgment, excellent communication, interpersonal and analytical skills, and possess a well-developed understanding of US policy interests.</p>

The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Program Manager is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

The program office now anticipates an RFP release in late December 2016 to ensure the release of a well-defined RFP. <br /><br />The Program's aim to refine RFP language stems from its participation as a pilot program for the U.S. Air Force's Bending the Cost Curve (BTCC) initiative. The BTCC initiative seeks to increase competition and find solutions that work for both the U.S. Air Force and industry. Program activities to refine RFP language, including extensive dialogue with industry, have taken longer than initially anticipated to complete. <br /><br />In order to align the production schedule with the Air Force strategic planning, the program's Full Operational Capability has been adjusted from Fiscal Year (FY) 2032 to FY34. It is important to note: the initial Operational Capability date remains FY 24. <br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">09 March 2016:<br /><br /></span></strong>1.

The program office now anticipates an RFP release in late December 2016 to ensure the release of a well-defined RFP. <br /><br />The Program's aim to refine RFP language stems from its participation as a pilot program for the U.S. Air Force's Bending the Cost Curve (BTCC) initiative. The BTCC initiative seeks to increase competition and find solutions that work for both the U.S. Air Force and industry. Program activities to refine RFP language, including extensive dialogue with industry, have taken longer than initially anticipated to complete. <br /><br />In order to align the production schedule with the Air Force strategic planning, the program's Full Operational Capability has been adjusted from Fiscal Year (FY) 2032 to FY34. It is important to note: the initial Operational Capability date remains FY 24. <br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">09 March 2016:<br /><br /></span></strong>1.

The terms ?bid? and ?bidder? refer to an offer submitted in response to an Invitation for Bid (IFB).  The term ?proposal? refers to an offer submitted in response to a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The terms ?quotation,? ?quote,? and ?quoter? refer to a non-binding submission in response to a Request for Quotation (RFQ) which is not an offer. <BR> <BR>Unless the Buyer indicates otherwise within a particular line item description, each Seller shall include in its online Bid/Proposal/Quotation individual pricing for all required line items in order to be considered for award (i.e., Do not use the ?Included in another line item? function when pricing each line item).  If a line item cannot be separately priced, you must notify the buyer through the FedBid ?Submit a Question? feature regarding which line item(s) should be included in which other line item(s) and request reposting.

Registration information can be found at www.sam.gov. <BR> <BR>Q&A -Please submit all questions by using the 'Submit a Question' button. This buy will then be reposted with Q&A based on the questions that come in (if applicable). <BR> <BR>The Contracting Officer will indicate elsewhere in this Buy as to whether responses will be evaluated for award based either upon (a) price and pricing factors only (Bids/Quotes) or (b) price and other factors (Proposals/Quotes).  All Bids/Proposals/Quotations must conform to the listed specifications or the Statement of Work.  If award criteria are based upon (b) price and other factors, the Contracting Officer shall clearly indicate the criteria to be applied elsewhere in this Buy. <BR> <BR>In addition to providing pricing at www.FedBid.com for this solicitation, each Bidder/Offeror/Quoter must provide any required, NON-PRICING responses (e.g. technical proposal, representations and certifications, etc.) so that they are received no later than the closing date and time for this Buy.

<DESC>This solicitation, SP4708-15-R-0001, was previously synopsized on January 15, 2015 under the FBO Presolicitation Notice "SP4708-15-R-0001(Update)".&nbsp; The solicitation&nbsp;can be accessed by selecting&nbsp;and downloading the attachments to this notice.&nbsp; Prospective offerors are advised to download and review all attached materials prior to responding to this solicitation.<br /><br /><strong>* Amendment 0009 has been&nbsp;issued as "Refresh No. 3",&nbsp;revising various portions of the solicitation, as summarized by Attachment 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please be sure to download, complete, and submit&nbsp;all attachments, as applicable.</strong><br />* Amendment 0008 has been issued to provide updated versions of "Attachment 6 - Historic Sales Data" and "Attachment 7 - Commercial Sales Pricing Practices", which previously contained electronic file errors.<br />* Amendment 0007 has been issued to replaced the Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) clause.&nbsp; The most recent versions of Attachments 1, 2, and 4 have been&nbsp;included&nbsp;in the attachment package for convenience. <br />* Amendment 0006 has been&nbsp;issued as "Refresh No. 2",&nbsp;revising various portions of the solicitation, and extended the closing date for the period ending October 30, 2015 to November 20, 2015.&nbsp;Please be sure to download, complete, and submit&nbsp;all attachments, as applicable.<br />* Amendment 0005 has been issued to add additional PSCs to Table A.6.2.1. <br />* Amendment 0004 has been issued to: update the table of "Quarterly Last Month Open Periods", extending the period opening on 06 July 2015 to 14 August 2015; add additional PSCs to Table A.6.2.1; provide updated "Questions and Answers" (see Attachments); add requirement for vendor verification regarding excluded items (see Attachments); and other revisions providing clarifications regarding excluded items.<br />* Amendment 0003 has been issued as "Refresh No. 1", revising various portions of the solicitation, resulting in editorial changes and updated terms and conditions.<br />* Amendment 0002 has been issued updating the table of "Quarterly Last Month Open Periods".&nbsp; <br />* Amendment 0001 has been issued in order to provide guidance on formatting requirements.<br /><br /><br /><br />DOD EMALL is an internet-based ordering service that allows customers to make a "Best Value" decision for products from a variety of sources through a single entry point based on price, delivery, product description, vendor performance, or other factors required to meet mission objectives.<br /><br />This DOD EMALL solicitation seeks to establish Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) type contracts for various commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items which will be ordered through the DOD EMALL system for delivery to DOD EMALL customers worldwide. DOD EMALL customers include DoD military and non-military customers, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) acting as or on behalf of the customer, and customers of other Government entities (including Federal, State, and/or Local). This solicitation is being issued as part of a Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Program using the guidance of FAR and DFARS Subpart 8.4 for ordering procedures. (See DLAD 8.400-90 DoD electronic mall (EMALL) and FAR 38.000 Federal Supply Schedule Contracting). The DoD MAS program is designed to provide logistic support that empowers the customer to select the product that best meets their mission needs using best value ordering procedures. <br /><br />This solicitation shall remain open for period not to exceed five (5) years in total length, unless sooner replaced by an updated solicitation, with recurring opening and closing periods on a quarterly basis. <br /><br />The intention of this solicitation is to make multiple awards for the entire spectrum of categories of items required. The maximum quantity of supplies for this acquisition is set at $100 Million (M) based on the aggregated total value of all of the individual IDIQ maximums to be established for each individual contract awarded as a result of this solicitation. The guaranteed minimum dollar value that the Government agrees to order during the period of any awarded contract will be $100.00. No order against any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation shall exceed $100,000.<br /><br />This solicitation will also act as an interim solution for prospective suppliers to submit catalogs for loading to the DOD EMALL system until this system is replaced by the Next Generation e-Commerce Solution (NGe-Com), which may become a "Federal Mall", or "FedMall" (note: this effort was previously referred to as "DOD EMALL 2.0"). It is anticipated that "FedMall" will be in its Full Deployment (FD) phase of development as early as the end of the third quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. Given this aggressive timeline and the overall complexity of this effort, it is anticipated that there will be an integrated concurrent approach to development and deployment.<br /><br />The scope of this solicitation is limited to a subset of the DLA Managed Federal Supply Classes (FSCs; also referred to as Product Service Codes (PSCs)) and commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items (see FAR 2.101) matching the FSC descriptions. Descriptions of the required items (and excluded items), technical requirements, and performance requirements are outlined in the solicitation's Schedule of Supplies/Services and Statement of Work.<br /><br />All ordering shall be conducted electronically. DOD EMALL is the sole means by which orders will be issued against any contract awarded in response to this solicitation. Prospective suppliers will be required to submit an Electronic Commerce ("EC") Implementation Plan with their proposals. The EC Implementation Plan shall detail the contractor's computer hardware/software, thereby outlining the contractor's capability to receive electronic orders. At a minimum, all responding offerors must address how they intend on interfacing with the DOD EMALL System and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service's (DFAS's) Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) system. <br /><br />Suppliers will also create a catalog using the Microsoft Excel workbook titled "DOD EMALL Catalog Loader Template and Instructions.xlsx" (see Attachment 2). The first spreadsheet (tab) in this workbook, entitled "Data Dictionary", provides descriptions and instructions for each of the catalog loader data elements, and identifies the ten (10) mandatory data elements that must be addressed for each item when creating a new catalog or issuing a catalog change. The second spreadsheet (tab), entitled "Requirements", provides the template that suppliers shall populate when submitting their catalog. The third spreadsheet (tab), entitled "Unit of Issue Codes", provides a listing of all acceptable Unit of Issue (UOI) codes used within the DOD EMALL system, which offerors are required to identify for each item in their catalog. The vendor shall also establish "Days After Receipt of Order (ARO)" for each item in its catalog. Vendors shall honor the posted delivery times in the catalog at the time of delivery order placement. Vendors will be required to make every effort to ship urgent or high priority orders within 24 hours after receipt of order, at no additional cost to the government, and meet all Preservation, Packaging, Packing, Labeling and Marking (PPPL&amp;M) requirements. All offered pricing within Supplier Catalogs shall be Fright on Board (FOB) Destination and must be inclusive of all shipping, handling, and transportation costs. Offerors may provide pricing and delivery terms based on customer location for Contiguous United States (CONUS) delivery; Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico (AHP) delivery; and Outside Contiguous United States (OCONUS) delivery. The DOD EMALL will provide the shipping addresses for each order placed through the DOD EMALL system. Shipment shall be made via traceable means.<br /><br />The terms of the contracts awarded as a result of the contemplated solicitation will have a Base Period and four (4) Option Periods (for a total of five (5) periods of performance). Each of these contract periods shall be for one year, unless otherwise specified in the award document. All contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation shall not exceed 60 months (should all option periods be exercised).<br /><br />The Government intends to award contracts without discussions on the basis of initial offers; however, it reserves the right to hold discussions and solicit Final Proposal Revisions (FPRs) if it is advantageous to the Government. The proposals will be reviewed in order of receipt and priority and compared to the checklist contained within the solicitation to ensure that offerors have submitted complete proposals. The Government intends to award to any responsible offeror who can comply with the supply and technical requirements at fair and reasonable prices. No award will be made to any offeror whose pricing is not considered fair and reasonable, or is uncompetitive with existing contractors providing the same supplies. An initial assessment of all proposals submitted prior to the closing date and time will be performed within a reasonable amount of time after offers are retrieved from the Business Opportunities Office to determine completeness. <br /><br />One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.

To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.

Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint.

<p>2. Experience:</p>
<p>NIST will evaluate the extent of the offeror's experience providing similar or same equipment and services.</p>
<p>3. Past Performance:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate, as appropriate, successful performance of contract requirements, quality and timeliness of delivery of goods and services, cost management, communications between contracting parties, proactive management and customer satisfaction.. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>
<p>4. Price:</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<p><br /><strong>STATEMENT OF WORK</strong></p>
<p>WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION <br />PREVAILING WAGE SEMINAR<br />Charlotte, North Carolina</p>
<p><br />PART 1<br />GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p><br />1. GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p><br />The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) Prevailing Wage Seminars (Prevailing Wage Seminars) are three-day compliance trainings designed for regional stakeholders (unions, private contractors, state agencies, federal agencies and workers). The compliance training provided has proven to be an essential force multiplier for WHD's enforcement efforts and stakeholder education.</p>
<p>Prevailing Wage Seminars are emblematic of WHD's enhanced commitment to prevailing wage enforcement. Seminars have significantly enhanced communication and collaboration with some of our most important stakeholders, such as the building trades labor organizations and contractors that have millions of dollars in government contracts. Our increased enforcement has also significantly elevated interest and attendance by state and federal contracting agencies. Previous seminars have averaged more than 300 attendees from the city where the seminar is held and from surrounding states and further. Prevailing Wage Seminars have proven a valuable tool in promoting and enhancing WHD's government contracts strategic prevailing wage enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>In addition, Prevailing Wage Seminars are a mission critical component of WHD's overall enforcement strategy. WHD believes that providing contractors and contracting agency staff with compliance assistance training prior to contract award significantly reduces unintentional errors and permits WHD to target its limited enforcement resources on the egregious violators.</p>

"Best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price."<br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<p>ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2<br />Paragraph (a) is hereby supplemented with the following:<br />(a). The total evaluated price must be reasonable, and any additional expense must be justified by a corresponding value for technical merit, or an expectation of greater quality of performance. <br />(b). Contractors may not qualify if any of the following are not met: <br />1. Proposal does not reasonably address the requirements in the request for proposal (RFP).<br />2. Proposal includes major deficiencies or omissions which discussions could not be expected to cure without a major revision or a new proposal.<br />3. Proposal is so technically inferior or so out of line in price as compared to other proposals as to preclude it from having a reasonable chance for award.<br />4. An unrealistically low price, may indicate lack of sound management judgment and lack of understanding of the requirement for the geographic area of service, or unbalanced pricing of line items, as proposed initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an imprudent offer.<br />5. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if necessary.</p>
<p>PART I TECHINICAL:<br />Technical capability to include product literature, catalog price lists if available; warranty, guarantee, technical specs, and delivery information.<br />Technical will be evaluated as either Acceptable or Unacceptable. Best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.<br />Definitions are as follows: <br />ACCEPTABLE: To be rated acceptable, the offeror's technical proposal must demonstrate it can meet all requirements. <br />UNACCEPTABLE: A technical proposal that fails to demonstrate it can meet one or more requirements will be determined unacceptable.</p>
<p>PART II PAST PERFORMANCE<br />Offeror is required to submit information, on a single page, identifying federal, state and local Government and private contracts performed within the past three years, which are similar in scope and complexity to the effort described in this solicitation. If none, offeror should so state and provide information on references.<br />Information provided by the Contractor shall state: The type of service or supplies provided with information to verify references: Names; telephone numbers; Points of Contact; amount of contract; and email addresses.<br />Past performance shall be used as an evaluation factor within the LPTA process, unless waived by the PCO in accordance with FAR 15.101- 2(b). It shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305 and DFARS 215.305. However, the comparative assessment in FAR 15.305(a) (2) (i) does not apply. Therefore, past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis using the ratings below.<br />Acceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br />Unacceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br />Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a) (2) (iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p><br />PART III PRICE:<br />Price will be evaluated separately from Technical and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonability. <br />Offeror shall provide their published price list with their offer. <br />(End of Addendum to 52.212-2)</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-3 OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (MAY 2014) ALTERNATE I (MAY 2014)<br />Vendors shall include a completed copy of FAR provision 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications with their offer.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the deadline to FRIDAY, APRIL 1, 2016 4:00 PM EST and&nbsp; to answer the following questions:<br /><br />QUESTION 1. The training levels you have requested are not available outside the US Coast Guard and are special classes for the coast guard. I have found that the special coast guard classed are not at the same level of the factory training we receive outside the coast guard. The factory level training is at a much deeper level and of more detail that the "C" or CM3 type of class. Also all of our training does not start with a C. We are 396 M1, M2 and M3 certified (there is no M4). For electronic MTU has changed the names often and based on what I have learned our ECS-UNI E1 class get us a serialized dongle which is the equivalent to your CE3 training. <br /><br />ANSWER: We will accept the MTU factory certificates for 396 M3 &amp; ECS-UNI E1 that are issued by MTU.</p>
<p>QUESTION 2. In the sources sought solicitation it was mentioned that there would be a site visit, if so I would like to see the site before I submit.</p>
<p>ANSWER: We decided to remove that option prior to award due to the time constraint. Since we are hiring the contractors in an oversight role, it is not critical to see the site prior to award.</p>
<p>3. In paragraph 8.1.3 we are required to have a "Dongle Emulator", I am not sure what this is but also do not want to assume. If I were to assume it would simple be our Dongle or access key to Diasys software. MTU does have emulators but they are very large test stands so I want to make sure that is not the reference.</p>
<p>ANSWER: You should be able to use the set up in the test cell to connect to an engine and use 1b dongle to demonstrate what it can do.</p>

The objective and intent of the requirement is to build a Golf Course Pesticide Mixing Pad adjacent to Building 3100 on Joint Base San Antonio - Ft. Sam Houston. The pesticide mixing pad provides a covered concrete surface for filling the spray vehicle pesticide tanks with water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The pesticide mixing pad is open to the outside, i.e., there are no walls. The covered pesticide pad protects the environment by containing any spilled pesticide liquid (typically called "rinsate") from the pesticide spray vehicles within the curbed concrete slab and sump. This prevents hazardous materials from flowing into storm drains, sanitary sewer, natural drainage areas, and flood zones.</span></p>

ANSWER: Selection Criteria #1 has been corrected and is now consistent with selection Criteria #2.

QUESTION 2: The last paragraph of the solicitation states, A-E firms utilized by the prime A-E must also submit complete Architect-Engineer Qualifications and resumes.

ANSWER:  An integrated submittal is acceptable.

ANSWER: A-E submittals are requested on SF 330s.

Question 5: Last paragraph: A-E firms utilized by the prime A-E must also submit complete Architect-Engineer Qualifications and resumes.  Do you need the complete SF 330 forms for all the subs or just section E (Resumes of Key Personnel Proposed for this Contract) and Part II(General Qualifications) of the SF 330 form.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1.	ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID: 
VA262-16-AP-3529	1A. PROJECT/TASK No. 
NA	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$72,540.00
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

Contractor shall repair a failed sensor associated for the AST (Above ground storage tank), a common Veeder root of three hundred and fifty (350) monitors, and two (2) UST - underground storage tanks. In November 2015- one of this sensors failed and the State of California Water Resources Control Board issued a notice of violation letter to correct the deficiency. (If the deficiency is not corrected VAGLAHS must pay a fine of $25,000/day until corrected). A firm fixed price purchase order will be issued to Tank Tek (a small business) located at 3672 Chicago Ave, STE. B, Riverside CA 92507.
3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

Tank Tek has worked with VAGLAHS on AST, and UST in the past (such as maintenance and repair of AST, UST and correcting violations) and is capable of bringing the Healthcare System up to code. Additionally, Tank Tek is currently repairing other AST, and UST at VAGLAHS. Tank Teck is well qualified to provide outstanding repair of AST, and UST and is able to correct the sensor violation.
4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
VAGLAHS has a requirement to correct AST, and UST sensor violations in order to remain operational and provide healthcare to veterans. Tank Tek has provided this service in the past, can correct VAGLAHS violations in order to satisfy critical compliance requirements and ensure continued operation of the facility in a timely matter. If another Contractor is utilized, VAGLAHS is at risk of non-compliance, and becoming non-operational thereby affecting veteran's healthcare. VAGLAHS must correct these violations or the hospital will be non-compliant and in non-operational status.
5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
This is an urgent and compelling procurement to correct the violation. There were no other companies that expressed interest in providing this service. The justification will be posted within five (5) days of the purchase order award on www.fedbizopps.gov.   This procurement will be awarded to Tank Tek as this is a critical requirement to keep VAGLAHS operational.
6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. Note: COs are required to make a determination of price reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3.  See the Commercial Supply and Service SOP for Price Reasonableness templates.

This is a Task Order for three months of service, April 01, 2016 through June 30, 2016. This procurement is being conducted in accordance FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C), "In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures."  This Task order is firm fixed price, and the NAICS Code is 524292 with a size standard of $32.5 Million.  

This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored.  However, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements it must furnish information about its products and services, as well as references from other customers who are using these products and services to the Contract Specialist within seven (6) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. Information must be mailed or hand-carried to:

Michael Sands
Great Lakes Acquisition Center (GLAC) - Southern Tier

North Chicago, IL 60064-3048

Information may also be sent via fax to (224) 610-3269 or emailed to Michael.sands3@va.gov.
