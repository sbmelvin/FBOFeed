<DESC>Background and Need:   This project seeks to characterize the effectiveness of a comprehensive preventive program in preventingberyllium sensitization and chronic beryllium disease (CBD) among beryllium-exposed workers. Exposure to beryllium can lead to sensitization and cause an immunologic granulomatous lung disease. Sensitized workers often have or develop CBD, but it is not presently known whether all of them will develop disease.

Project Objective:   This project will offer study participants the beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT) to detect sensitization. Each participant?s blood sample will be split and sent to two independent laboratories for processing.

Scope of Work:  Each contractor shall perform a valid laboratory screening blood test, beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test. We estimate 450 - 600 tests to be performed by each laboratory between 03/01/2008 and 02/28/ 2010.  We have also included an option year for 600 additional tests should they be necessary.  They Government may or may not exercise the option.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name basis is for the use of Citrix Licenses. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for the Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the Citrix Licensing product as a key component of the Department's OpenNet Everywhere (ONE) networking server farm. The license listed above is required to support the system explansion and future growth of the ONE program. The Citrix licenses provide access to the Citrix server farm located within the Department of State for remote dial-in from posts and or stations throughout the U.S. and abroad.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for the justification. Rather, the products identified by brand herein have been determined to be the only items taht meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's ONE networking infrastructure. The ONE network infrastructure is a Citrix environment and any deviations to the Citrix licenses would pose technical anomalies that could potentially interrupt the availability of the remote servers to the Department of State employees. The goal of the Department is to form a cohesive network infrastructure where resources will be better and more easily remotely accessed.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The U. S. House of Representativeýýýs Committee on Appropriations has recommended that the U. S. Department of Energyýýýs (DOE or the Department) Office of Management contract with the National Academy of Public Administration (the Academy) for a review of the Departmentýýýs acquisition policies and processes; human resources; and financial management functions.  Accordingly, based on the unique capabilities of the Academy, MA intends to solicit a proposal and negotiate a sole source contract with the Academy to perform an expert, independent organizational review of the effectiveness and efficiency of these functions pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source. Specifically, the review will encompass the following three interconnected areas: Procurement/Acquisition - The Academy will review the Departmentýýýs existing acquisition policies and processes; analyze oversight policies and procedures; and examine how procurement/acquisition support is delivered across the Department.  The review will include the organizational structure; roles and responsibilities of both Headquarters and Field Organizations; delegations of authority; service metrics; procurement systems, and staffing levels for offices performing procurement/acquisition activities, to identify options for improvement and to ensure alignment with the DOE mission. Human Capital - The Academy will assess the delivery mechanism for human capital services department-wide by reviewing how support is delivered across the Department, including the organizational structure; roles and responsibilities of both the Headquarters and Field Organizations; delegations of authority; policies, procedures, and systems; service metrics, and staffing levels for offices performing human capital activities, to identify options for improvement and to ensure alignment with the DOE mission.  The Academy will further examine the Departmentýýýs leadership development and performance management activities, and its efforts to address issues related to DOEýýýs aging workforce. Financial Management - The Academy will examine how the Office of the Chief Financial Officer and DOEýýýs financial services organizations throughout the field support the mission programs of the Department.  The review will focus on the financial management, accounting, budgeting, and performance management functions within the Department.  The review will also assess the status of the implementation of the extensive reorganization of DOEýýýs financial services organization that occurred during Fiscal Years 2004 and 2005; including organizational roles and responsibilities; delegations of authority; policies and procedures; performance metrics; and staffing levels for the officeýýýs performing those functions. The Academy is the preeminent independent, non-profit organization for public governance.  Established in 1967 and chartered by Congress, the Academy has become an independent source of trusted advice for every branch and level of government, congressional committees, and civic organizations.  The Academy works constructively with government agencies to improve their performance and management through problem solving, objective research, comprehensive analysis, strategic plans, and connecting people and ideas.  It exists solely to assist the Government achieve excellence.  As such, the Academy is uniquely qualified to carry out this review due to its experience and expertise in analyzing and evaluating governmental structures and processes.  The Congressional charter established the Academy for the purpose and objective of evaluating the structure, administration, operations, and program performance of federal and other governmental agencies, anticipating, identifying, and analyzing significant problems, formulating practical solutions and/or suggesting timely corrective actions.

The Department of Defense (DoD), Washington Headquarters Services (WHS), Acquisition and Procurement Office (A&PO) intends to solicit offers in response to request for proposal (RFP) HQ0034-08-R-1029 to procure enterprise net-centric solutions for information technology (IT) supplies and services to support Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) supported organizations, that provides all users with responsive and efficient access to common information and services on a daily basis, including timely disaster business recovery support.

The specific objectives of this acquisition are to: (1) achieve net-centricity; (2) promote objectives of WHS/ Director of Administration and Management (DA&M) Strategic Plan for 2007-2012; (3) facilitate transformation of the OSD enterprise; (4) satisfy OSD Chief Information Officer (CIO) customer needs for secure long-term IT solutions; (5) capitalize on industry best practices and innovation to meet emerging\changing IT requirements; and, (6) minimize use of Government provided facilities/resources/workspace, and requirements for security clearances.

The contractor(s) will be required to provide labor, hardware/software and other equipment and materials required to provide a wide range of net-centric IT supplies and services for customers and organizations supported by OSD CIO at classifications levels up to TS/SCI.  The contractor will provide OSD with support for current and evolving IT requirements in classified and unclassified environments, providing/maintaining connectivity, computing, system development, operations and maintenance, core IT services, information management and performance management services across all OSD clients and domains in a user support environment that is dynamic and continually evolving.  

The Government intends to award two single-award indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contracts (with issuance of both firm fixed price and cost plus fixed fee type orders).  The ordering periods for both contracts (A) & (B) will be for a base period of two years, plus three one-year options, each with an estimated award date in the 4th quarter of FY 08.  Contract (A) will be awarded based on full and open competition (unrestricted) with a ceiling of $450M over the life of the contract; Contract (B) will be awarded as a small business set-aside with a ceiling of $50M over the life of the contract.   The major task areas are as follows (listed by contract award): Contract A:  Customer Support; Systems Operation, Administration, and Maintenance; Engineering Services; Applications Development, Maintenance, and Support; and, Business Continuity to support the Defense Continuity Program; Contract B: Information Assurance and CIO Mission Support; and, Contracts A & B:   IT hardware, software, licenses, maintenance, ancillary support products, and related material.

By the RFP closing date for receipt of proposals, to be eligible for award: (1) all members of the offeror's team (prime contractor, subcontractors, joint venture partners, etc) providing personnel, including supervisory personnel, to perform the work must possess a Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI)  facilities clearance; (2) the prime offeror must have a current adequate accounting system to allow for award of cost reimbursement task orders as determined by their cognizant Defense Contract Audit Agency; (3) must submit an acceptable mitigation plan of potential organizational conflicts of interest; (4) be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database; (5) unconditionally accept the terms and conditions of the RFP, and (6) submit all required information specified in the RFP.

The North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) code for Contract A is 541512; the NAICS for Contract B is 541513 with a small business size standard of $23.5M.  Offerors (applicable to large businesses only) submitting proposals for Contract A are required to submit an acceptable small business subcontracting plan prior to award, per FAR 19.702(a)(1).  

An Industry Day conference will be held on 29 February 2008 from 1000 to 1230 at 1777 N. Kent Street, Rosslyn, VA 22209 (14th Floor, conference room #3).  All attendees are required to meet in the lobby no later than 0945. The objective of the conference is to convey pertinent information and obtain industry comments and suggestions concerning the draft RFP documents with the goal of exchanging ideas between Government and Industry for improving the draft RFP.  Parties planning to attend the conference are required to submit company name and the attending individual's name.  Two forms of official identification, one of which shall be a photo ID, shall be required to be shown upon arrival unless individuals currently have a Pentagon access badge or DoD Common Access Card (CAC card). All required information for access to the building must be forwarded to Mr. Bruce Baldwin at bruce.baldwin@whs.mil by 12:00 P.M. on 26 February 2008.  Due to space limitations we are limiting each company to two (2) representatives and registration is on a first come, first serve basis. Travel, lodging, and expenses are the responsibility of the Industry Representatives and will not be paid by the Government.  The building is located near the Rosslyn Metro and there is public parking (for a fee) in close proximity as well. 

The Government will utilize procedures found in FAR Part 15 to select the proposals that represent the best value to the Government.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract after conducting discussions with offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within the competitive range. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to reject any and all proposals and award to other than the lowest priced offerors.

The entire solicitation will be made available only on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) Website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Paper copies will not be available. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to this solicitation. Please address any questions to Bruce Baldwin (703) 696-3869 or e-mail to bruce.baldwin@whs.mil.

<DESC>The ultimate purpose of the proposed project is to provide the Afghanistan Ministry of Interior (MOI) surveillance and over watch capability of all major thoroughfares in Kabul City and the surrounding areas.  The network will cover the entire City o f Kabul and connect the National Police Command Center (NPCC) and Kabul City Police with a route surveillance and security system, to include all US and multinational camps.  Phase 1 of the installation will coverall major roads and traffic circles with sp ecial emphasis covering all Ministry compounds and Military Installations.  Phase 1b will include local residential locations in order to ensure that all major roads within the city are covered.  This effort will consist of establishing a command and contr ol center that will be monitored 24 hours a day, with the capability to track and identify personnel and vehicles via license plate recognition and personnel identification. This effort will also include at least two years of operations and maintenance of the current infrastructure, planning and execution and overall expansion in Kabul and across Afghanistan, with future years maintaining the country wide network within other cities within Afghanistan.  The offeror shall be able to design, engineer and impl ement the expansion of the existing security network in all major cities identified by the MOI across Afghanistan with multiple command centers within each city.  The offeror will provide and manage long haul communications networks for the cameras to ensu re that future construction does not impact the broadcast capability of future cameras. All cameras will have a continuous non-stop microwave transmission with backup power in order to ensure continual coverage when city power is not available.

<DESC>*************PLEASE CONTACT DENECE NORRIS FOR QUOTE OR TECHNICAL CONCERNS.  CONTACT INFORMATION IS IN THE BODY OF THIS SOLICITAION****************************** NASA/MSFC has a requirement for (1) Gage Insite Enterprise System Software. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Indysoft Corporation on a sole source basis.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons. 1.  Indysoft Gage Insite's application workflow and resulting data management approach offers a higher level of integration with existing Calibration Facility software programs and simplifies data interchange with Existing systems.	Gage InSite Enterprise delivers a powerful and flexible system that will help MSFC become more efficient with a dedicated equipment management system that is more scalable and reliable.  Indysoft Gage InSite application controls system access with security profiles built-in and a sign off system.  User access can be set by MSFC with all documents protected from unauthorized editing.  The application can create an audit trail detailing all changes made to the system. 2.  Indysoft Gage Insite is a web based software application that eliminates the need for additional software licensing as the needs expand to other locations within NASA.  Indysoft Gage InSite Enterprise application delivers faster access using MSFC existing web browser.  Workstations can connect over a standard 56K line via the Internet.  Further, systems can be mixed and matched so MSFC internal network will continue to run at peak efficiency and users get the speed and security without the cost of additional licenses. 3.  Market research was conducted which determined no other sources offered a product that met the specifications and requirements needed.  Indysoft Corporation utilizes a unique technology which is proprietary and must be compatible with the present designs being used at MSFC. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 02/08/2008. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. All contractual and technical questions must be in writing (email or fax) to Denece Norris at denece.a.norris@nasa.gov or faxed to 256-544-4401.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Morocco:  Technical Assistance:  Meat Processing Facility Wastewater Treatment System

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop technical assistance for the optimization of water usage schemes, and improved wastewater collection/pre-treatment systems in meat processing facilities throughout Morocco.  The assistance will analyze current waste generated by meat processing facilities in Morocco, identify technical and financial specifications for on-site treatment and complete removal and disposal of wastewater, develop an action plan for pollution minimization, and develop a monitoring tool to ensure that the recommendations of the action plan are implemented and maintained.

The Government of Morocco operates 158 municipal meat processing facilities and over 750 rural open-air meat processing farms with a total meat production estimated at 230,000 tons.  Because a significant number of meat processing facilities, especially in rural areas, are not connected to the sewer system, liquid waste generated from those meat processing facilities is either treated through septic tanks or not treated at all.  Meat processing facilities that are connected to the sewer network directly dispose of their liquid waste without proper pre-treatment.  
The proposed Technical Assistance is intended to assist the Moroccan Office of Potable Water (ONEP) identify financially viable solutions and wastewater treatment techniques that will accomplish the following objectives:
- Characterize in detail the quality and quantity of current waste/emissions generated by the various types of meat processing facilities in Morocco
- Identify the technical specifications and financial requirements for on-site rapid stabilization/treatment of waste.  This will include the development of plans outlining all the necessary works and equipment, including the measures and regulations of the installations, and a list of potential U.S. suppliers of the required purification equipment and installation plans, taking into account the hindrances caused by the operation of the meat processing facilities.
- Identify the technical specifications and financial requirements for complete removal of the waste from meat processing facilities in Morocco (conforming to the norms and standards for waste on all parameters). 
ONEP is the agency responsible for the management of public service liquid waste treatment and will serve as the Grantee for this activity.

The Terms of Reference for this Technical Assistance include:

Task 1:  Kick-off Meeting and Review of Relevant Reports and Data
Task 2:  Documentation of Meat processing facilities in Morocco  
Task 3:  Data Collection and Collation
Task 4:  Diagnoses of Pollution
Task 5:  Developing Action Plan for Pollution Minimization
Task 6:  Feasibility and Financial Analysis
Task 7:  Development of Monitoring and Pollution Management Tools
Task 8:  Environmental Assessment
Task 9:  Assess Development Impacts of Project
Task 10: Prepare Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $378,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

Morocco Industrial Wastewater Treatment System Feasibility Study

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the construction of an industrial wastewater treatment system in Berrechid to treat industry effluents and enable proper collection and pre-treatment of wastewater from the industrial park.  

Berrechid is a municipality in the province of Settat in Morocco.  In 1970, an industrial park was created on a surface of 120 Hectares, which today sits over 412 hectares and is home to more than 60 production facilities in sectors including electric appliances, food industries, cosmetic fabrics, mechanics, and agricultural products.  In addition, the area accounts for 13.25% of national agricultural production.  
The Government of Morocco (GoM) has recently begun implementing stricter environmental laws to improve the country's management of wastewater discharges in an effort to more effectively address water scarcity issues.  Enforcement actions have also been increased to comply with European Union environmental regulations, which require certification that exporters of food products meet strict standards for the treatment of wastewater.  In response to these actions, there is a concerted effort amongst the Moroccan private and public sector to comply with these requirements in order to get potable water to communities affected by water scarcity.  To provide potable water to these areas, the GoM is looking at technologies, which can create significant opportunities for U.S. exporters of goods and services in the wastewater treatment sector, as the United States is the leader in tertiary wastewater treatment technologies.  The GoM has allocated funds to apply to infrastructure improvements in the wastewater treatment sector. 
This Feasibility Study will help The Office for National Potable Water (ONEP) identify financially viable solutions and techniques that will allow achievement of the following objectives:
i.	Characterize in detail the quality and quantity of current waste/emissions generated by the industrial park in Berrechid for complete production cycles in periods of high production.
ii.	Identify the technical specifications and financial requirements for on-site rapid stabilization/treatment of waste.  This is to include development of plans outlining all the necessary works and equipment, including the measures and regulations of the installations, a list of potential suppliers of the required purification equipment and installation plans, taking into account the hindrances caused by the works to the factory operation.
iii.	Identify the technical specifications and financial requirements for complete removal of the waste (conforming to the norms and standards for waste on all parameters).  
ONEP is responsible for the assurance of the compliance of industrial liquid emissions/waste to the national norms and thresholds for waste disposal into the public sanitary network and will serve as the Grantee for this activity.

The Terms of Reference for this Feasibility Study include:

Task 1: Kick-off Meeting and Review of Relevant Reports and Data
Task 2: Categorization of Industries
Task 3: Audit Tool Development and Data Collection
Task 4: Data Collation and Analysis
Task 5: Review Moroccan Wastewater Standards, Screen Current Treatment Technology, and Identify Treated Wastewater Quality Requirements
Task 6: Technology Screening and Analyses
Task 7: Prepare Feasibility Study for Project
Task 8: Environmental Assessment
Task 9: Stakeholders Workshop and Communication Plan
Task 10: Assess Development Impacts of Project
Task 11: Prepare Final Report 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $392,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>The CDC, Office of Strategy and Innovation (OSI), has a requirement for Activating Innovation which is essential and highly beneficial for direct acceleration of health impact and will assist in preparation for public health challenges and target its structural and budget priorities to meet agency goals.  In order to drive innovation throughout CDC, credible expertise is required to employ breakthrough futuring methodologies and technologies for providing unbiased objective research using an outside-in view of the future that is based in deep research and reliable forecasting methodology. The outside-in approach is required to fully develop a robust and innovation operational plan required to establish a world-class public health innovation program.  Activating Innovation will support the foundational work required to successfully develop and implement an evidence-based public health innovation program as well as allow the CDC to gain new and substantive insights about the role of public health innovation and prevention outcomes, health care quality, and costs.  The Government intends to award a sole source contract to the Institute for the Future (IFTF) as a logical follow-on to previous work done by IFTF for Phase I of the project which required the generation of a Global Economy Public Health Economy custom map and a Cooperation Workshop.  Phases II and III will require the following:  Public Health Innovation Collaboratory and Immersive Experiences for Innovation Working Groups. Each phase is approximately one year in duration. The IFTF has close to 40 years of experience long-term data-based forecasting versus short-term data-based forecasting and it is this unique approach and support for the development of a sustainable public health innovation program that is so vital and important to CDC?s OSI.  The CDC will have access to all of IFTF's archives of future forecasting materials and research, all IFTF training and consultation opportunities, specialized research activities, and reports designed specifically for the CDC.  The period of performance will be a twelve-month base year and one, one-year option period, beginning on or about 1 April 2008.  Solicitation documents will be available on or about 21 February 2008, through the Federal Business Opportunities website at http:///www.fedbizopps.gov/.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Mink Hollow systems, Inc.,120 Ashton Road, Ashton, MD to provide Portable Temperature Data Acquisition Systems Software. This sole source procurement with Mink Hollow systems is because of unusual and compelling urgency. The Fire Fighting Technology Group conducts live fire burn experiments in buildings of opportunity throughout the United States. For over six months, the group has been working with the National Fire Protection Association Research Foundation, The fire Department of New York City, Brooklyn Polytechnic University and Department of Homeland Security to arrange a series of live burns in a seven story structure on Governors Island, NY. This project which involves wind driven fire in multi-story structures requires a multi-story structure, in a location with steady winds and low humidity.  The seven story structure on Governors Island typically meets the wind and humidity conditions during February and March. The field team has an urgent and unusual need for Lab View data acquisition programming and field support for the data acquisition. It is urgent because if a programmer is not in place in February, the test window will close and this structure and wind and humidity conditions will be lost. The hardware needs to be programmed, deployed to the island, and the experiments must be conducted before the structure is demolished. Mink Hollow Systems has performed similar work on the NIST campus for several years, and has staff that can complete the programming, deploy to the island, and can operate the system in the field.



A fixed price purchase order will be issued on or about February 15, 2008 and performance will be through approximately March 31, 2008.  
The Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to meet the requirement and objectives as described in this synopsis. Capability statements may be e-mailed to Barbara.Suhrie@nist.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not a request for quotation. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>erik.lundstrom, 206.764.6698
<DESC>Please contact Dawn Hickman at Dawn.R.Hickman@nws02.usace.army.mil for any questions regarding this project.  The Seattle District Corps of Engineers has a competitive requirement for construction services on a project titled, FY08 Railroad Upgrade,  Fort Lewis, Washington.  The project consists of constructing a facility that provides the following: <BR><BR>1) Expansion of the Interchange (IC) Yard in the Logistics Center, both widening and lengthening.  The design removes a total of 4 existing trac ks on the south side and adds 3 new tracks on both the north and south sides of the main lines, for a total of 6 new lines, presently serving Ft. Lewis.  Total additional track in the IC Yard area amounts to approximately 10,200 linear feet of track, ties and ballast as well as associated crossovers, highway grade crossing and all site work associated with the expansion of the IC Yard.  A gravel maintenance road is to be provided on both he north and south sides of the IC Yard.  New exterior lighting and fe ncing will be provided on the most of the perimeter of the new yard.  <BR><BR>2)  To accommodate expansion of the IC yard, East Lincoln Road and its rail crossing must be diverted and extended around the new yard.  A sweeping S-curve alignment will be re plicated approximately 1,200 feet east of the existing location.  The new road will include two 12-foot pavement sections and 4-foot gravel shoulders.  Normal pavement markings and signage are included, but only crossbuck signs at the rail crossing will be  provided, without additional signalization.  <BR><BR>3) Construction of a new Locomotive Maintenance Facility (LMF) of approximately 5,800 square feet.  (Demolition of the existing LMF will be accomplished under separate contract.)  The new enclosed facil ity will provide maintenance and storage space for three locomotives along with a small office/breakroom space.  Approximately 800 linear feet of track, ties and ballast along with turnouts are associated with the new entrance to the LMF from the IC lead t racks.  Track design follows the basic BNSF design of 12-foot shoulders, walkway ballast and drainage ditches on either side.  The rail design also incorporates a 2-panel at-grade crossing on the east side of the building.  Shop equipment includes a 7.5-to n bridge crane, storage and pumps for lubricants and glycol, an air compressor, welding equipment, storage shelves, and a small exterior hazardous materials storage building for lubricants and glycol.  The LMF will house the following spaces: a small offic e area, tool/janitor area, bathroom with shower, electrical and communications closets, the shop area (4900 sq. ft.) with a below-ground-surface maintenance pit for one locomotive space and several large overhead coiling doors.  The concrete slab is reinfo rced in the shop area for jacking a 120-ton locomotive.  The mechanical design incorporates high-intensity infrared heaters for the shop area and a split system, air-source heat pump for the small office/break room.  Fans and louvers provide summer ventila tion and incorporate sensors and controls to exhaust fumes generated during short-duration operation of locomotives.  Roof is standing-seam metal, siding is metal with low-wall brick veneer.  Windows utilize laminated glass.  Building will be sprinklered w ith a wet-pipe system.  Construction means, methods and materials will result in a LEED-NC rating of silver on the LMF building.  <BR><BR>4)  Utility runs to the LMF include domestic and fire water supply, electrical power, copper and fiber optic communica tion lines and stormwater management facilities.  Electrical service includes relocation of overhead to underground service a distance of approximately 2400 feet, including some additional manholes and concrete-encased raceway under roadways, connecting to  a 225 kVA transformer outside the LMF, pad mounted on a concrete vault.  Some steel casing of lines beneath railroad track is required.  Sanitary Sewer service  includes provision of a duplex grinder pump station and 2,240 feet of 1?-inch forced main and approximately 120-feet of 4-inch gravity main.  Water service will be provided by extension of an 8-inch ductile iron main approximately 1,175 feet to the LMF si te.  Stormwater facilities include a bioinfiltration facility receiving sheet flow and piped roof drainage.  Grade requirements may force importation of as much as 89,000 yards of suitable fill.  Unsuitable soils removal could amount to approximately 42,00 0 yards, emanating from approximately 1? feet of unsuitable material removal from the top of previously undeveloped areas.<BR><BR>The estimated construction cost range is $10,000,000-25,000,000 and the performance period is estimated at 365 calendar days.  The NAICS code for this project is 237990.  The solicitation will be a unrestricted competitive request for proposal utilizing the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable source selection process resulting in award of one fixed-price contract in accordance wi th Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Research, Development & Engineering Command Acquisition Center intends to negotiate solely with CodeSource Inc. for delivery of one fully integrated laser marking system to support Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier, Program Manager  (PM) Soldier Equipment.<BR><BR>It is anticipated that this action will be a sole source contract that will support a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) delivery order.  CodeSource Inc. is uniquely qualified for this effort, because it is the only company capable of f ully integrating a laser marking system capable of making MIL-STD 130(M) compliant laser cut labels using TESA label material.  PM Soldier Equipment currently has an earlier generation machine and corresponding software package from this contractor with wh ich the new system must be compatible.  No other contractor can provide this integrated proprietary software and system.  No other contractor could meet the Governments requirement without excessive expenditures and an unacceptable delay before the necess ary equipment would be delivered. <BR><BR>The FOILStar 300 Laser Marking System with DPLNexus Marking Laser is a stand alone system used to produce laser engraving of Unique Identification (UID) labels for hard ballistic body armor plates being assessed by  the Non-Destructive Test Facility (NDTF).  The UID labels produced by this system, and installed on each hard ballistic body armor plate, will enable the NDTF to establish a data record unique to each plate evaluated resulting in the required plate data c ollection and analysis.  The NDTF system uses a reader to capture the (UID) label on the ballistic insert being evaluated.  As a plate moves around the conveyor belt, the plates UID is read, the plate is x-rayed, results are collected associated with the UID and compiled automatically into a database.  The rejected plates are automatically separated from the accepted plates.  This system automatically populates a database to permit data mining for logistical, operational, and research analyses. <BR><BR>How ever, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of publication of this announcement. Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability  to comply with the requirement. Responses received will be evaluated, however a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses ar e received, the U.S. Army Research, Development & Engineering Command Acquisition Center will proceed with awarding a firm-fixed price contract to CodeSource Inc.<BR><BR>U.S Army Research, Research, Development and Engineering Command Acquisition Center po int of contact for this requirement is Mr. Michael J.

<DESC>BAA for FY2008-FY2010 Chemical and Biological  Defense Initiative Fund & Chemical/Biological Technologies Directorate Physical Science and Technology Division New Initiatives

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION.

The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to solicit research proposals for Chemical and Biological Defense Program, Defense Threat Reduction Agency requirements for the Chemical and Biological Defense Initiative Fund (CBDIF) BAA and the Physical Science & Technology (S&T) Division New Initiatives BAA.

SCOPE:

The DoD CBDP, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and the Joint Science and Technology Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JSTO-CBD) are seeking optimum approaches to meet technology objectives within both the Physical Science & Technology and the Medical Science & Technology areas for the CBDIF, and the Physical Science & Technology New Initiatives.

PURPOSE:

The CBDIF goal is to fund new and innovative chemical and biological science and technology projects across a wide range of military operations. Established in FY2003, it is Congressionally directed with the intent to provide funds via a competitive acquisition to non-Government entities. Proposals may only address those topics presented in Attachment 8 of the BAA.

The Physical Science & Technology Division, Chemical and Biological Technologies Directorate, in its continuing mission, seeks new and innovative ideas for experimental and theoretical development of technologies to fill DoD requirements for chemical and biological defense. The goal is to identify and select science and technology projects that can be transitioned to joint acquisition programs. Proposals may only address those topics presented in Attachment 8 of the BAA.

SOLICITATION APPROACH AND OVERVIEW:

This BAA is a multi-year BAA, remaining effective for three years from the initial date of issuance, unless amended otherwise. Multiple calls for proposals may occur in conjunction with this BAA. The topics and timelines (Attachment 8) published in the initial issuance are firm. In the future, ongoing, new or emerging requirements may necessitate amendment of the BAA to include new or different topics. At any time that the topics are amended, new proposal submission milestones (timelines) will be specified and as applicable any limitations specific to the topics will be noted.

Over the span of its term, this BAA will solicit basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development proposals for the topics presented in Attachment 8 and in effect at the time. Depending on the nature of requirements and/or available funding, each of these research categories may or may not be included in the most current List of Topics. Proposals may each address Basic Research, or Applied Research and/or Advanced Technology Development as specified in each topic. Proposals will not be accepted or considered that combine Basic Research with Applied Research and/or Advanced Technology Development.

The Government encourages proposals that span a wide spectrum of possible technical and business solutions in response to the specific technology topics stated in Attachment 8 of this BAA. The Government reserves the right to award any combination of approaches which offer the best overall value to the Government, and to oversee any and all processes and approaches once ongoing.

The full range of flexible assistance and acquisition related statutory authority arrangements available to DTRA are possible results from this announcement including but not limited to contracts, grants, and Other Transaction Agreements. Each of the several applicable procurement instruments offer different advantages, liabilities and responsibilities for offerors and the Government.

POINT OF CONTACT:

Questions regarding the technical and administrative content of this BAA must be sent to cbdif-cbt08-10baa@dtra.mil. All questions must include the BAA number in the subject line.

<DESC>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  The Government intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract to Midvale Environmental Technologies.  Product Description: ADM GPX Type VII Starch-g Acrylic Blast Media.  The GPX, MIL-P-8589, Type VII is a hybrid blasting media which combines acrylic plastic with corn starch.  Current Type V plastic media is used on other aircraft to strip paint, but is too aggressive for the T6-A aircraft.  GPX Type VII Starch-g Acrylic Blast Media is softer and less aggressive than plastic (Type V) media currently in use for other aircraft.  Interested parties capable of providing the above must submit a written quote to include discount terms, tax identification number, cage code, and DUNS.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.     However, any quotes received by the quote due date will be considered by the Government.     A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.     Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Justification for other than Full and Open Competition:
The T-6A has not been painted since 1998 due to the aggressiveness of current media (Type V) used to strip other aircraft. The Air Force Research Laboratory and the Air Force Corrosion and Prevention Office evaluated GPX media and approved it to remove paint from the T-6A substrate.  GPX, MIL-P-8589, Type VII is a hybrid blasting media that combines acrylic plastic with corn starch. The Midvale Environmental Technologies Company is the only North American Dealer for this product

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is charged with developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States, US allies and friends from ballistic missile attack. The Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, kinetic energy systems, directed energy systems, battle management, and command control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from Boost Phase through Midcourse and into Terminal Phase.  MDA efforts are focused on making the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and better able to handle a broad range of unknown missiles, warheads, trajectories, and adversaries.  In addition, the BMDS must function without extensive detailed a-priori knowledge of our adversary's systems.  Wherever adversaries launch, to whatever target they choose, MDA must be able to detect, track, identify and kill the ballistic missile.

In support of these efforts, MDA programs are geared towards advancing technological thresholds in hardware and software, through fundamental scientific breakthroughs in areas such as mathematics, physics, and engineering.  This push is essential to the strategy of spiral development with Block improvements in the BMDS every two years.  

MDA advances technology that enables near-term, evolutionary growth in current systems while adding revolutionary systems to substantially improve the BMDS in the far term.  The MDA Advanced Technology Deputate (DV) is responsible for developing advanced capabilities for the BMDS. This includes planning and executing a broad range of enabling and advanced technology development efforts, developing the technology base for advanced BMDS Blocks, assessing emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and leading the effort to develop advanced algorithms for improving BMDS capability.
  
MDA/DV has instituted the Missile Defense Science, Technology And Research (MSTAR) Program in order to sponsor fundamental, BMDS relevant research and development at accredited United States universities and academic institutions as well as to support training of future scientists and engineers in the field of missile defense.  The MSTAR Program, administered by MDA/DV, is designed to identify and develop new and innovative concepts, stimulate technology innovation, and exploit breakthroughs in science to offer robust technology improvements to all elements of the BMDS.  MSTAR is a competitive, science and technology university research program, which consists of forefront research and development technology, concepts, and approaches acquired through scientific and technological investigation.  

MSTAR Research Topic Areas

Specific research areas for each missile defense phase encompass the entire engagement sequence to include Surveillance, Acquisition and Tracking, Discrimination, Communications, Engagement Planning, Threat Engagement, Evolving Threats and Countermeasures, and Kill Assessment.

<DESC>NASA/GRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for S band data telemetry systems in support of the Ares I Upper Stage Development Flight Instrumentation (DFI)  Telemetry System Preliminary Requirements  The NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio will be acquiring a telemetry system for the Development Flight Instrumentation System (DFIS) that is planned to fly on the Upper Stage of NASA?s Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV).  The telemetry system is expected to consist of a transmitter, antennas (2 at 90 degree vehicle diversity [TBR]), and properly matched radio frequency connection cable(s). This notice is issued by the NASA GRC via the Internet to post a Request for Information (RFI), seek product availability, and solicit responses from interested parties.  Responses are to be forwarded to the technical point of contact, Robert E. Jones only via e-mail to Robert.E.Jones@nasa.gov or facsimile transmission at Fax: (216) 433-8705 no later than [INSERT DATE, 14 days after release of RFI].  The voice phone is (216) 433-3457.  Prospective offerors are also invited to submit initial written or verbal comments or questions for clarification to the technical point of contact.  Prior to any facsimile transmission, please contact the technical point of contact via phone.  Do NOT call the procurement primary point of contact listed on this notice to clarify technical information.  Only preliminary information is included within this document.  Very comprehensive information about system operation, storage, and transport environmental requirements, as well as test and verification parameters in the form of attachments containing a draft SOW and Specifications will be posted for comments when finalized, but not before the deadline of this RFI. The anticipated type of procurement action is to obtain a completely integrated telemetry system using commercially available components that are configured to meet NASA?s specific function.  The contractor is expected to provide the entire system, or subcontract the necessary components.  Some units will also need to undergo spaceflight qualification (i.e. environmental) testing prior to delivery.  Flight units will also need to undergo acceptance testing (3 line items:  commercial unit, commercial units spaceflight qualified, commercial units acceptance tested prior to flight).  A fourth line item for technical support is also anticipated.  An indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contract is anticipated with minimum and maximum number of telemetry systems over a five year period will be specified.  The contractor is expected to be able to either perform the environmental and space flight qualification testing, or subcontract for it. The following information is requested: 1.The viability of providing an integrated telemetry system at the proposed center frequency, bandwidth, modulation format, and transmitter power. 2.Your ability to provide an integrated telemetry system, including verification and validation of flight test requirements for the system. 3.It is assumed that a slightly modified commercial item will be procured, however, if the preliminary requirements indicate that a commercial item procurement may not be possible, please inform us. 4.Availability of band pass and band reject filtering options in the transmitter, at the power and band levels indicated. 5.Do any requirements in the preliminary document indicate a significant price increase from your standard commercially available hardware? 6.Identify if there is anything unclear in the preliminary requirements document. 7.Will having ?to be determined? (TBD) and ?to be resolved? (TBR) items (specifications portions to be finalized after award) pose a problem with proposing a firm fixed price for performance? 8.Will having technical support priced by the hour pose a problem? (The actual amount of technical support is unknown and is anticipated to be procured by the hour with a not to exceed number of hours specified in the actual procurement). 9.Do you normally provide some number of technical support hours to assist with hardware integration and test? Background The Upper Stage is the second stage of NASA?s new Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle.  In order to gather the data needed to support flight performance and model verification, Development Flight Instrumentation is planned to fly as an independent system on the first five Ares I development test flights. The Ares I Upper Stage Project is led by the NASA Marshall Spaceflight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama.  On behalf of the Upper Stage Avionics and Flight Software Integrated Product Team at NASA MSFC, the NASA Glenn Research Center is responsible for designing, developing, testing and delivering the Upper Stage DFI system. A vendor survey indicated that commercially available telemetry components may satisfy the radio frequency S-band performance requirements of the Upper Stage DFI telemetry system.  Consequently, it is expected that the US DFI telemetry system will be based on currently available upper S-band frequency commercial transmitter, antenna and coaxial cable components configured to support the data transmission rates required for the Ares I Upper Stage DFI.  In addition, the telemetry system components must pass space flight qualification and acceptance testing to be performed by the contractor per NASA requirements. DFI Preliminary S-Band Telemetry Requirements General Requirements The DFI S-Band Telemetry System will collect and transmit DFI vehicle data from the Upper stage and J-2X engine directly to the Earth-based ground monitoring stations of NASA?s Communications & Tracking Network (CTN).  The DFI Upper Stage telemetry system includes one transmitter mounted inside the instrument ring of the CLV Upper Stage, and an antennae system mounted externally on the vehicle.  All Upper Stage CLV DFI telemetry system hardware is considered expendable after an approximate ten minute operational flight time. The DFI Telemetry System shall meet flight operational performance for a flight time of approximately ten minutes. The total mass of the DFI Telemetry System shall not exceed [TBR] lbs.	Weight reduction is a design goal. The DFI Telemetry System shall satisfy its performance requirements during exposure to the flight thermal environments defined in the Upper Stage [TBR] documents. The DFI Telemetry System shall satisfy all flight performance requirements after exposure to vibration and shock environments as defined in the Upper Stage [TBR] documents. Preliminary Transmitter Requirements The DFI S-Band Transmitter is a component of the telemetry system.  The transmitter shall consist of a packaged unit capable of accepting the composite DFI data stream from a data acquisition unit, and sending this collected data to the Earth-based ground monitoring stations of NASA?s Communications & Tracking Network (CTN).  The transmitter shall be capable of sending this data in a format compatible with the CTN systems.  The materials used in the construction of the transmitter shall be chosen to minimize the effects of extreme environments.  All Upper Stage CLV transmitter system hardware is considered expendable after an approximate ten minute flight time. Operational Frequency:	The DFI S-Band Transmitter shall be tunable over the S-band frequency range to operate at a discrete frequency of 2370.5 MHz. Modulation Function:  The DFI S-Band Transmitter shall operate using Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation. Modulation Format:  The DFI S-Band Transmitter shall provide two independent PSK-modulation functions (I and Q) [TBR]. Voltage Input: The DFI S-Band Transmitter shall operate and meet flight operational performance specifications with a steady state input voltage range of 23 to 36 VDC. Power Input:  The maximum DC power consumption of the transmitter shall not exceed [TBR] Watts when the output is enabled and [TBR] Watts in standby mode over operational temperature range specified in [TBR].  Power Output:  The DFI S-band Transmitter shall support up to 50 Watts of transmit power. Data Rates:  The DFI S-band Transmitter shall provide data at a rate of 10 Mbps for each channel (I and Q). Data Input:  The DFI S-band Transmitter shall accept a pulse code modulation (PCM) data stream. Operational Temperature:  The DFI S-band Transmitter shall operate over a temperature profile range consistent with being internal to a dynamic launch vehicle over a 10 minute ISS launch trajectory [toward 51.6 degrees inclination] [TBR]. Operational Shock and Vibration:  The DFI S-band Transmitter shall operate over a shock and vibration profile consistent with being internal to a dynamic launch vehicle over a 10 minute ISS launch trajectory [TBR]. Solid State:  Solid state devices and amplifiers are given preference over electromechanical relays and other vibration sensitive electrical/electronic equipment.   Band Reject Requirements:  The DFI S-band Transmitter shall be filter tuned to reject RF energy by a minimum of 50 dB [TBR] over the frequency range from 2025 MHz to 2120 MHz. Band Pass Requirements:  The DFI S-band Transmitter shall be filter tuned to pass RF energy over the frequency range from 2300 MHz to 2400 MHz.  Preliminary Antenna Requirements The DFI S-Band Antenna is a component of the S-Band telemetry system of the Upper Stage of the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV). This system will collect and transmit vehicle data from the Upper Stage and J-2X engine directly to the Earth-based ground monitoring stations of NASA?s Communications and Tracking Network (CTN) .The DFI Upper Stage telemetry system currently plans for two surface antennas mounted on the exterior of the instrument ring of the CLV Upper Stage.  The antenna shall have the advantage of low height, high efficiency, and full hemispherical coverage. The materials used in the construction of the antenna shall be chosen to minimize the effects of extreme environments.  All DFI Upper Stage CLV antenna system hardware is considered expendable after an approximate ten minute flight time. Frequency Range:  The DFI S-band Antenna assembly will be tuned to operate over the frequency range from 2300 MHz (TBR) to 2400 MHz (TBR). Power Handling:  The DFI S-band Antenna RF power handling capability shall be 50 W [TBR] continuous wave at all pressures between ambient pressure and 10-5 Torr [TBR]. Operational Temperature:  The DFI S-Band Antenna operational temperature limits shall range from -300F (-184C) to +300F (+149C). Shock Temperature:  The DFI S-Band shall be capable of handling a temperature shock of +500F (+288C). Operational Shock and Vibration:  The DFI S-band Antenna shall operate over a shock and vibration profile consistent with being external to a dynamic launch vehicle over a 10 minute ISS launch trajectory [TBR]. Connector Requirements:  The DFI S-Band Antenna shall be connected to the telemetry system through a standard type TNC female connector or standard SMA female connector. Solid State: Solid state devices and amplifiers are given preference over electromechanical relays and other vibration sensitive electrical/electronic equipment. Preliminary RF Cable Requirements The DFI S-Band Coaxial Cable is a component of the S-Band telemetry system of the Upper Stage of the Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV). This system will collect and transmit vehicle data from the Upper Stage and J-2X engine directly to the Earth-based ground monitoring stations of NASA?s Communications & Tracking Network (CTN).  The CLV Upper Stage telemetry system includes coax cables which connect the S-Band telemetry system components mounted inside the instrument ring of the CLV Upper Stage.  The coax cable shall act to route and deliver RF power to the components of the S-Band telemetry system.

<DESC>The 688 Armament Systems Squadron (ARSS) at Eglin AFB, FL, is seeking sources capable of providing up to seventy six (76) transmitters/receivers/transceivers to replace existing transmitters/receivers/transceivers on a robotized All-Seasons Vehicle (ASV) MD-70 commercial tractor used to dispose of unexploded ordnance.  

The replacement transmitters/receivers/transceivers must meet the following requirements/specifications:

  a. Signal Direction: transmit video one direction from Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to Operator Control Unit (OCU); transmit digital data in both directions from UGV to OCU and OCU to UGV; has a minimum of one audio channel from the UGV to the OCU.  Separate data and video transceivers/transmitters/receivers may be used if single radio solution is not available.
  b. Digital Data Throughput: half duplex or full duplex, data throughput of 57.6K Baud both directions.
  c. Digital Data Connector: data fed into and out of radio via RS232 at 57.6K Baud.
  d. Video Connector: video fed into UGV radio and out of OCU radio via analog NTSC M at 30 fps.
  e. Range: minimum of 1.5 miles line-of-sight in a normal RFI environment; minimum of 3.0 mile line-of-sight desired.
  f. Frequency: if single radio solution then operating bandwidth will be 4400 MHz to 5000 MHz with a selectable or programmable center frequency within this band; if multiple radio solution then 4400 MHz to 5000MHz for video with a selectable or programmable specific center frequency within this band (225 MHz to 400 MHz may be used for data).
  g. Environment: operate in temperatures between 0 and 120 degrees F; Storage between -20 and +140 degrees F.

The following requirements/specifications are desirable but not required:

  a. Single Unit: data and video transmitter and receiver are integrated into a single radio and only one is needed per OCU and UGV.
  b. All Digital: video transmission is digital.
  c. Bandwidth: combined video/data bandwidth is 2.5 MHz or less.
  d. Audio: includes a single (separate from digital data) audio channel from OCU to UGV (voice only so can be low fidelity digital).  Alternately, the data radio can provide a digital data throughput higher than 57.6K Baud from OCU to UGV to accommodate digitized audio multiplexed into the digital data stream.
  e. Power: external 12VDC input power (variable input power is allowable).

If your firm can meet the requirements, please respond by completing the attached Market Research Questionnaire by 6 Mar 2008.  Identify any proprietary information, "Proprietary Information-For Government Use Only".

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.  NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PURSUANT TO THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT:

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Office of Investigative Technology (ST), Radio Unit is seeking information from sources that are capable of installing, removing, repairing, and performing corrective and preventive maintenance services for DEA owned Motorola Land Mobile Radio (LMR) and communications equipment located worldwide.  The equipment consists of fixed station equipment (repeaters, base stations, etc.), control consoles, antenna systems, Key Management Controllers (KMC), Key Management Facilities (KMF), mobile and portable units.

Background:

The DEA communications network utilizes Motorola?s Advanced Securenet technology with the capability of over-the-air-rekeying (OTAR).  This encompasses all types of Land Mobile Radio (LMR) equipment:  mobile/portable radios, base stations, repeaters, and consoles.  Domestic systems are 406-420 MHz UHF range, which is limited to Federal government agencies.  There are some domestic divisions which utilize equipment on VHF systems as well as equipment that interoperates with 800 MHz systems as a liaison with state and local police departments.  Foreign systems are a conglomeration of VHF, UHF, HF, 800MHz, and commercial systems and frequencies as approved by the host county.  DEA is evolving into narrow-band, digital modulation format.  The Motorola equipment will be backwards and forward compatible with existing DEA-owned equipment manufactured by Motorola.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

General maintenance includes preventive and corrective repair.  DEA requires the removal and installation of mobile radios from and into Official Government Vehicles.  In addition, DEA requires the installation and/or removal of fixed equipment, with associated antenna systems, at fixed locations such as building rooftops or communications towers.

These specifications outline the requirements for the delivery of a high level of systems availability, performance, and support for the DEA communication system.  This system consists of fixed station equipment (repeaters, base stations, etc.), antenna systems, control stations, remotes, Key Management Controllers (KMC), Key Management Facilities (KMF), as well as mobile and portable radio equipment.  DEA requires a program of tightly coupled services that will allow it to achieve the operational benefits intended for this system.

The contractor shall facilitate the installation, removal, maintenance, and repair of DEA owned Motorola radio communications equipment within the 48 contiguous states, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and other overseas locations with DEA field offices.  Maintenance includes, but is not limited to, the labor and parts required to repair equipment, which has become defective through normal wear and usage.  Service shall be performed in accordance with standard commercial practices and manufacture specifications.  The specification also requires service to be performed and coordinated through qualified field and centralized resources.

<SUBJECT>63 -- Trip Wire Sensor System
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-08-00001
<RESPDATE>022008
<ARCHDATE>01312009
<CONTACT>Brenda Brady, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-6771, Fax 202-254-5396, Email brenda.brady@dhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T), is seeking information on the availability of existing tripwire sensor systems. The tripwire sensor systems are for installation outdoors, must have low power draw, long lifetime (greater than 1 year), capable of long detection ranges (greater than 200 yards), and small packaging size (less than 0.25 ft3 for exposed sensor portion).  Sources able to satisfy the capabilities below are invited to submit capability statements describing their system.  At a minimum, capability statements should include: 

1) A description of the system that clearly identifies, (i) where commercial off the shelf (COTS) and non developmental items (NDI) have been utilized, (ii) where modification to existing items are required, (iii) where new developmental items are required, and (iv) all power requirements.

2) Expected performance of all sensor, communications, and power components including a summary of any past performance that may be applicable to the proposed system.

3) Environmental (rain, fog, cold, etc.) and terrain conditions that might affect or limit the systems performance.

4) Packaging of all system components and methods for making the system as covert as possible.

5) Methods for aligning the tripwire sensor either during installation or after emplacement and to include specifying minimum height requirements

6) Cost and schedule estimates for a complete system to meet delivery six months after receipt of order.

Concept of Operations:  A tripwire sensor system that can detect, classify (human vs animal), and report a human that crosses a designated linear region.  The sensor component for the tripwire is envisioned to be above ground and not require burial (components of the communication or power supply system can be buried). The lengths for the tripwire sensor system may vary from 200 yards to over several miles depending upon the particular span of space/ground that needs to be covered. In some cases, uneven ground can limit line of sight along the designated linear region such that the detection system will need to be segmented into a number of shorter tripwires. To accommodate uneven ground and obstructions, the tripwire systems needs to have a configurable distance or range stop included. The tripwire sensor system needs to perform detection, localization, classification, and reporting functions when personnel cross the linear detection region.  The tripwire sensor system is envisioned to contain classification capability that allows distinguishing a human that crosses the linear region from animals, vehicles, or wind blown material.  The region to be monitored by the tripwire sensor may be adjacent to areas of human activity. The tripwire detection system should not trigger from activity that is parallel to and more than 4 feet from the linear detection area.

Covertness: The tripwire sensor system needs to be covert.  The tripwire system should not be easily seen or detected by an adversary crossing through the linear detection region.   Camouflaging or disguising all exposed components is required. The sensor component of the tripwire system may need to be placed in a cleared area such as the ?slash? on the northern border where camouflaging should be employed. There are scenarios where the tripwire sensor system will be required to be disguised by emplacement within another structure for concealment.  An example of emplacement is within a hollowed out portion of a concrete bollard, other structures, or a tree.	

Power:  A system with a lifetime of greater than 1 year is required for the tripwire sensor system.  It is desired that the power consumption for the tripwire detection system be low enough to permit battery operation for the required lifetime. However, in some circumstances, the tripwire sensor system may be installed in regions where power augmentation by solar panel or commercial power is permissible such that these powering options will not be ruled out.

Communications: The tripwire system needs to report out the passage of a person through the linear detection region with attached classification information. The tripwire system should use an existing ISM band (i.e., 902-928 MHz, 2.4-2.5 GHz) or the current CBP VHF band (i.e., 134 -174 MHz).   Other suitable bands are 315 and 433 MHz.  For situations where multiple tripwire system are installed with ISM band radio subsystems, a networked communications system is desired to aid in relaying the data to the local CBP station or headquarters and to provide command and control of the sensor if required. The desired message protocol is the Common Data Interchange Format (CDIF). The vendor will follow the CDIF rules and identify the message blocks that apply to the sensor operation.

Performance Features:  It is desired that the trip wire sensor system be able to:

1. Detect: Pd of greater than 95% for a human crossing the designated linear region

2. Classify: human versus non-human

3. False reporting rate should be less than 1 a day for a one mile linear region

4. Localize: to at least the length of a sensing region

5. Report to the end user

6. Operate in the environmental conditions typically encountered along the northwest and northeast border regions of the United States

<DESC>SOURCE SOUGHT NOTICE for trial in-water installation of the already procured Montgomery Point Lock and Dam hinged crest gates maintenance dewatering structure (MDS) in each of the two designated positions at the site and perform other related work in  accordance with the Scope of Work contained herein. The purpose of the MDS is to facilitate isolation of five (5) out of the total ten (10) hinged crest gates at a time for inspection, maintenance, and replacement, as needed.   Respond no later than 20 Fe bruary 2008.  In addition to and before the two trial installations, the Contractor shall perform one pre-trial in-water installation to troubleshoot any problems. <BR><BR>The MDS was previously installed in one of the its two designated positions at the s ite in the dry in 2003, before the project was commissioned, and verified with respect to the completeness of all needed components and the fit of various components After trial installation in the dry, the MDS was dismantled and various components stored. <BR><BR>The Montgomery Point Lock and Dam, located near the confluence of the White River with the Mississippi River, include a gated navigable pass, an overflow spillway, and a lock.  The gated navigable pass is made up of ten, approx. 30-ft wide by nomin ally 13-ft high hinged crest gates (actual structural height of the gates is approximately 18 ft.), which are raised and lowered as required to maintain upstream navigable depths on the White River Entrance Channel.<BR><BR>The purpose of the MDS is to isol ate the hinged crest gates for inspection / maintenance / replacement in a dewatered environment, without disrupting the river traffic.  The MDS can be used for maintenance of five (5) hinged crest gates at a time, in two different installation positions o f the MDS.  MDS Installation Position 1 permits the dewatering for Gates 1 through 5 (and partially Gate 6), and Installation Position 2 dewatering of Gates 6 through 10 (and partially Gate 5), Gate 1 being closest to the lock wall and Gate 10 being adjace nt to the navigable pass abutment pier.  <BR><BR>The MDS consists of the following main components:  a. Four (4) column clusters - 2 upstream (1 end and 1 middle) and 2 downstream (1 end and 1 middle).  The maximum weight of any of these structures is 67,5 20 lbs. The downstream clusters are taller than the upstream clusters, because of different bottom elevations.  Each of four-legged clusters shall be installed in their respective receptacles formed in the ogee and wedged (using hydraulic cylinders mounted  on the clusters) in place to resist the water pressure on the installed structure.  b. Four (4) tie braces (2 for each pair of upstream and downstream column clusters) between the upstream and downstream column clusters to maintain proper distance and to assist in the stability of the column clusters.  The maximum weight of any of these structures is 2000 lbs.  c.  Four (4) support beams - 2 upstream (1 short and 1 long) and 2 downstream (1 short and 1 long), supported by the column clusters and by recesse s provided in the lock wall or abutment pier (depending upon installation position). The maximum weight of any of these structures is 76,780 lbs.  d. Eighteen (18) hinged needle panels - 9 upstream (1 left end, 1 right end, and 7 intermediate) and 9 do wnstream (1 left end, 1 right end, and 7 intermediate). The downstream needle panels are taller than the upstream needle panels. The maximum weight of any of these structures is 39,200 lbs.  The needle panels are connected by hinges to the support beam s at the top and supported at the bottom by sill plate installed on a concrete ledge. The hole of the hinge is larger than the hinge pin to permit the needle panel to move up as it hits the sill plate; this would also facilitate easier removal of the needl e panels after their use. The needle panels are sealed against the sill and against one another along the sides.  The end panels also seal against the concrete walls and against the parallel bulkhead.  To prevent the needle panels from slamming against the concrete ledge at the bottom, each panel shall be restrained by a tagline connecting the panel to a winch on the handling barge.  e. Two (2) sets of parallel b ulkheads (opposite of each other), parallel to the flow direction, each containing three sections (bottom, middle and top).  The maximum weight of any of these structures is 54,000 lbs. The bottom section of the bulkhead is profiled to seal against the pro file of the lowered hinged crest gate (either gate number 6 or gate number 7, depending on the installation position), the concrete ogee, and against the needle panels on the sides. Seals are also provided between the bottom and middle sections and between  middle and top sections.   All three sections of the bulkhead are equipped with Hilman rollers which interface with rails mounted on the column clusters.  For each MDS installation only one of the bulkhead sets (depending upon installation position) is ne eded.  f. One (1) temporary cofferdam to be installed under flow conditions around one cluster receptacle, at a time to allow for access to the receptacle for cleaning it for proper placement of the column cluster. The weight of  this structures is 25,600 lbs.  Before access to the receptacle, the inside of the cofferdam needs to be dewatered by the use of one or more temporary dewatering pumps. , The temporary cofferdam is equipped with rubber seals and Orkot bearing pads at the bottom. The position of t he temporary cofferdam will be set using distances from the abutment walls shown on the reference drawings. The cofferdam, when installed on the upstream side, is to be stabilized in its installed position by two retention arm engaging with the hook pin em bedment in the upstream face of the navigable pass.  The cofferdam, when installed on the downstream side, will be supported at the bottom against support pedestals anchored to the concrete floor downstream of the crest gates, and at the top by slings secu red to the already-installed upstream column clusters.  One (1) semi-automatic lifting beam to handle each parallel bulkhead section.  The lifting beam is also guided by the rails installed on the column clusters.  <BR><BR>This is tentatively a FY 2008 fis cal year award.  The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is seeking industrial capability and input from interested parties prior to issuing a solicitation.  This program is not restricted and is open to both large and small business participation under NAI CS codes 237990.  It is intended to reach as many interested parties as possible.

<SUBJECT>R -- HR Executive Consulting Services
<DESC>The United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO), Office of Human Resources has a continuing need for Human Resources Executive Consulting. The USPTO will renew its membership in the Learning and Development Roundtable, a program of the Corporate Executive Board. 

The Corporate Executive Board (CEB) provides best practices research and executive education to a membership of the world's leading corporations and not for profit institutions. A core competency of CEB is consulting with HR Executives.

Corporate Executive Board's strength and uniqueness in the market place is due to the combination of an unparalleled research staff, cutting edge support tools, and years of chronicled-proprietary research. 

These tools are accessible to the entire HR staff and are a valuable source of information at a fraction of the cost of normal consulting services. Therefore, the USPTO has decided to sole source the requirement to the Corporate Executive Board. No other product or service offered in the market place is as comprehensive and simultaneously as cost effective.

Interested Organizations may submit their capabilities and qualification to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 P.M. EST on 2/7/2008. 

Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort in a full and open manner, based on responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<SUBJECT>Q -- Outpatient care for inmates
<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Medical Center (FMC Butner), intends to award a sole source purchase order to Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC. To provide care to inmates referred for inpatient and outpatient care when care is not otherwise available from the contract provider (MDI), such continuity of care is to avoid unnecessary legal exposure. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1 - only responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. The NAICS code is 622110. To the best of our knowledge, Duke University Medical Center is the only provider of this service. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, as no solicitation document is available. However any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give a written or fax notification to the Contracting Officer within five (5) calendar days from the date of this published synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer, FMC Butner, Attn: Teresa Cooper, P O Box 999, Butner, NC 27509. Information can be faxed to 919-575-4821. Responses received will be evaluated, however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>53 -- ADM GPX STARCH ACRYLIC BLAST MATERIAL
<DESC>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  The Government intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract to Midvale Environmental Technologies for ADM GPX Type VII Starch-g Acrylic Blast Media.  The GPX, MIL-P-8589, Type VII is a hybrid blasting media which combines acrylic plastic with corn starch.  Current Type V plastic media is used on other aircraft to strip paint, but is too aggressive for the T6-A aircraft.  GPX Type VII Starch-g Acrylic Blast Media is softer and less aggressive than plastic (Type V) media currently in use for other aircraft.  Interested parties capable of providing the above must submit a written quote to include discount terms, tax identification number, cage code, and DUNS.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.     However, any quotes received by the quote due date will be considered by the Government.     A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.     Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Justification for other than Full and Open Competition:
The T-6A has not been painted since 1998 due to the aggressiveness of current media (Type V) used to strip other aircraft. The Air Force Research Laboratory and the Air Force Corrosion and Prevention Office evaluated GPX media and approved it to remove paint from the T-6A substrate.  GPX, MIL-P-8589, Type VII is a hybrid blasting media that combines acrylic plastic with corn starch. The Midvale Environmental Technologies Company is the only North American Dealer for this product

Biophysics and Biomedical Modeling Division seeks the acquisition of this new thermal maniki n to replace one of the two currently-operating thermal manikins used for protective clothing research.  The current manikins were originally built by General Electric in 1955 and Arthur D. Little Corp in 1986.  Although both manikins have been retrofitted  with more modern control systems within the past five years, there has still be a considerable amount of recent downtime due to various faulty sweating and heating components.  We have chosen MTNW because currently, there is no comparable manufacturer of thermal manikins that can provide a complete system at a total cost similar to the MTNW Newton Manikin.  Nothing herein should be misconstrued as a request for proposal.  No solicitation document is available.  See Note 22 which reduces the response time  to 5 days.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Anticipated award date is no later than 16 February 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 15 February 2008.  PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION.  Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Tracey Burgess at 252-335-6790.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

<DESC>I.	Project Overview 
The U.S. Railroad Retirement Board (RRB), an independent Federal Government agency, with headquarters located at: 844 North Rush Street, Chicago, IL 60611-2092, seeks sources to provide superior alternatives to the current tape cartridge-based data backup methodology in use for backing up the RRB?s data for restoration in case of disasters or other events requiring data recovery.  
The RRB seeks information about alternative back-up solutions for the agency?s servers of various sizes and types.  The objective of this notice is to determine the variety of technical approaches available, their appropriateness for the RRB, and the affordability of services and functions.
II.	Current Tape Cartridge-Based Data Backup Methodology 
Details about the current RRB LAN, mainframe, and enterprise (multiplatform) environments are available upon request from Ms. Velinda Nix at Velinda.nix@rrb.gov of the RRB Acquisition Management - Procurement Division at 312/751-3387.
A.	Backups are performed for an IBM z890, two MS Exchange 2000 servers, a MS SQL 2000 server, and approximately 50 of the RRB?s approximately 100 Intel-based servers running a combination of Windows 2000 (Advanced Server Domain with Active Directory Service) and 2003 server software.  The agency contracts with an off-site 3rd party as a disaster recovery site. 
B.	Currently in use, for mainframe system backups, is IBM?s Fast Dump Restore (FDR).  Network backups are performed using Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM).  Both systems use 3590 tape cartridges.  The tapes are stored offsite.  
C.	Our current weekly backups consist of approximately 4 terabytes of network data and 1.5 terabytes of mainframe data.  An average of 60 tapes are created for weekly incremental backups, stored off-site.  
D.	An MS Windows 2000 Web applications environment and MS SQL 2000 database environment is supported for non-mainframe application needs.  All agency users are supported by the agency?s Windows 2000 domain using TCP/IP access for Internet, Intranet, email/scheduling (MS Exchange 2000), and mainframe computing. 
III.	Statement of Objectives
In order to meet the RRB?s anticipated requirements, the Contractor shall:
A.	Coordinate, as necessary, with the agency?s remote disaster recovery site for disaster recovery testing and actual disaster situations.
B.	Provide RRB with reports available from backup solutions.
C.	As a Federal agency, for data security purposes, all data must be secured in accordance with Federal regulations.
D.	Provide secure transport and storage to safeguard all RRB-related data, providing 24 hour/seven day data access.
E.	Provide and maintain any and all necessary software/hardware at the RRB and, if required, the agency?s designated disaster recovery facility.
F.	Provide, both in a classroom setting and in written form, on-site training at the RRB headquarters for approximately 20 RRB network, systems, and operations personnel to familiarize them with the techniques and procedures utilized in the backup and retrieval of data.  The contractor shall also instruct RRB personnel in the technology and procedures for performing backup and retrieval of data so that they can perform all tasks required of them to successfully backup and retrieve data.
