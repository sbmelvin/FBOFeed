Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on Federal Business Opportunity (WWW.FBO.gov). It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.
<p>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Manager Training Devices (PM TRADE), Project Manager for Ground Combat Tactical Trainers (GCTT) joining with PM TRASYS is contemplating a new acquisition to develop a Joint solution to integrate, produce, test, refresh hardware/software, and upgrade capabilities of the CDT systems and full replacement of the existing USMC Operator Driver Simulators (ODS). The Common Driver Trainer (CDT) and the USMC Operator Driver Simulator (ODS) are both virtual driver training simulators that leverage technology to fill a need for wheeled, tracked and specialty vehicle driver training. The CDT is designed to meet the specific training needs of institution and Major Army Commands (MACOM). The ODS is used to complement entry and sustainment-level driver training and licensing for tactical wheeled vehicles. Both training systems provide initial familiarization training, skills progression and sustainment for wheeled and tracked vehicles. The systems provide capabilities that allow students to become familiar with a realistic arrangement and operation of the vehicle, including starting and stopping procedures, monitoring instruments and familiarization with procedures employed while driving under varied terrain, environmental, visibility and vehicle dynamics simulations. Through the selection of scenarios, both systems train the physical and mental skills required to safely operate tactical vehicles by permitting the instructor to observe student driver performance and their reactions to artificially induced malfunctions and emergency conditions through skills progression. <br />The proposed solution shall work within the existing footprint, power and HVAC building requirements. <br />The systems will include the following variants: <br />&bull; Tank Variants (TV)<br />&bull; Tank Engineer Variants (TEV)<br />&bull; Tactical Wheeled Vehicle (TWV)<br />&bull; USA and USMC MRAP vehicle variants (MV)<br />&bull; Stryker Vehicles (SV)<br />&bull; Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV)<br />&bull; High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV)<br />&bull; Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR)<br />&bull; Capable of incorporating future vehicle variants training systems</p>
<p>The CDT allows for training in all identified driving tasks as required for each variant, including individual and collective tasks up through platoon level. The CDT variants shall provide the capability to train trainees to operate major appended subsystems. Appended subsystems shall include, customer directed major system add-ons (e.g. plows, commander's station, gunner's station) based on the variant critical training requirements. The CDT variants shall enable training in critical driver and crew tasks that can be repetitively trained in a simulated environment.</p>
<p>Statement of Need:</p>

<DESC>This Market Survey/Request for Information (RFI) is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently planning the release of a final Screening Information Request (SIR) in the second quarter of FY2017 for the full range of flight services to users in the Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii and Puerto Rico.  The FAA intends to award a single contract from that SIR.

In advance of the final SIR release the FAA is posting this draft SIR for Industry information and comment.  The documents contained in this announcement are a result of the FAAs consideration of Industry comments received on the previous market surveys. 

The FAA is requesting potential offerors who are interested in pursuing this opportunity, in a prime contractor capacity, to submit a notice of intent to the Contracts Specialist listed below.  A notice of intent is requested whether or not comments to the draft SIR are provided to the FAA.  Failure to submit a notice of intent or respond to questions does not preclude a vendor from submitting a proposal to a future SIR.

The following is a list of draft documents contained within:
	Section B: Schedule of Supplies and Services
	Section C: Performance Work Statement
	Section D: Packaging and Marking
	Section E: Inspection and Acceptance
	Section F: Deliveries or Performance
	Section G: Contract Administration Data
	Section H:  Special Contract Requirements
	Section I:  Contract Clauses
	Attachment J-1: Description of Services
	Attachment J-2:  Transition Constraints
	Attachment J-4:  Performance Requirements Summary
	Attachment J-5: Flight Services Traffic Data
	Attachment J-6: IRDs and System Guides
	Attachment J-7: Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL)
	Attachment J-8: Data Item Description (DID)
	Attachment J-9: FFSP Strategic Plan
	Section K: Representations and Certifications
	Section L:  Instructions, Condition, and Notices to Offerors
	Section M:  Evaluation Factors for Award

This is a Market Survey/RFI. This is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Offer (RFO) of any kind. Responses to this Market Survey/RFI will be used for informational purposes only.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to this Market Survey/RFI. Any costs associated with this Market Survey/RFI submittal is solely at the interested vendor's expense.  

I.	PURPOSE

This Market Survey/RFI is a continuation in a series of announcements regarding the Future Flight Services Program (FFSP).  Since 2011, the FAA has released the following announcements related to the FFSP:  

1.	Market Survey 11279 - Industry Survey for Future Flight Service Program (FFSP) - November 2011
2.	Market Survey 11872 - Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS) - June 2012
3.	Market Survey 12393 - Future Flight Service Program (FFSP) Market Research - FAA/Industry Communication - October 2012
4.	Market Survey 14575 - Flight Service Direct (FSD) - July 2013
5.	Market Survey 23394  Future Flight Service Program (FFSP) Market Survey/Request for Information  January 2016

The purpose of this Market Survey/RFI is to:

	Assess market interest and capabilities to satisfy the requirements for the FFSP
	Solicit industry feedback on the FFSP Draft SIR and FAA questions

II.	CURRENT DELIVERY OF FLIGHT SERVICES

Currently, FAA flight services throughout the United States are delivered by a combination of the systems and contract vehicles identified below. All the contracts provide services in accordance with FAA Order JO 7110.10 Flight Services.

1.	The Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) contract (DTFAWA-05-C-00031), with Lockheed Martin Corporation, provides the full range of flight services to users in the CONUS, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.  The contract provides certified Flight Service Specialists who deliver preflight, inflight and flight data services to users via telephone and radios.  Lockheed Martin provides personnel, equipment and facilities for flight services under the AFSS contract.  The FAA provides Lockheed Martin with access to and use of its air-to-ground radio and telecommunications infrastructure to facilitate inflight communications. 

2.	The Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS) II contracts (DTFAWA-15-C-00035 and DTFAWA-15-C-00036), with CSC Government Solutions (CSC) and Lockheed Martin Corporation, provides users with internet-based preflight services (self-briefings and flight plan filing) without the aid of flight service specialists.   

3.	The Operational and Supportability Implementation System (OASIS) II contract (DTFAWA-15-C-00006), with Harris Corporation, provides an automation system for the Alaska flight service facilities that enables FAA flight service specialists to provide weather briefing and flight planning assistance to general aviation pilots, as well as, emergency services, law enforcement support, regulatory information and other services. 
 
III.	FFSP OBJECTIVES AND PLANNED ACQUISITION STRATEGY

FFSP Objectives
The FAAs Future Flight Services Program (FFSP) vision is to transform and modernize the delivery of flight services. The FAA believes that costs can be reduced by focusing on changing user behavior and migrating to automated, self-assisted service delivery models, while still maintaining quality of service and safety.  

Through FFSP, the FAA seeks to create a long-term contract vehicle and establish relationships with the Service Provider, industry and user groups to better position the agency to take advantage of user behavior changes and improved technology. 
Together, government and industry will work to realize three strategic goals:
1.	Reduce the FAA cost to provide Flight Service, with a target reduction over 65%.
2.	Encourage the use of technology, industry best practices, and authoritative flight data accessed through SWIM to improve efficiency and quality of service delivery.
3.	Facilitate and gain stakeholder acceptance of changes in Flight Service delivery.

  Planned Acquisition Strategy

The FAA intends to conduct a competition and award a single contract.  The FFSP contract will replace the existing AFSS and DUATS II contracts. The FAA Draft SIR is structured to allow maximum flexibility to adapt to changing conditions to meet user needs.    The FFSP Draft SIR will:

	Require the Service Provider to provide all facilities, equipment, and personnel to perform preflight, in-flight, and flight data services. 
	Utilize a contract structure(s) that allows for the modification and/or phased elimination of services with associated cost adjustments over the life of the contract.  
	Utilize a contract structure(s) to incentivize continuous improvement, the integration of new technologies, service optimization, and cost savings/sharing opportunities. 
	Allow for commercial revenue opportunities (e.g., advertising) if there are cost savings benefits to the Government. 

Although, the FAA anticipates the OASIS II (automation platform only) requirement to be incorporated in the scope of the FFSP SIR, the FAA does not intend to replace OASIS at contract award.


IV.	INDUSTRY FEEDBACK 

The FAA requests Industry comments on the FFSP Draft SIR. The FAA also requests Industry response to the questions below.  

1.	The FAA seeks feedback on the CLIN Structure and Type and Incentive/Award fee provisions. Please discuss whether the Draft SIR will allow the FAA to achieve the stated objectives and the vendor to implement its business model.  Do the Incentive/Award fee provisions reward innovation and drive increased use of technology? Please provide any recommended changes to the CLIN Structure, CLIN Type, or Incentive /Award fee provisions, along with the reasoning behind the recommendations.  
2.	The FAA recognizes user behavioral change is uncertain, however significant change has occurred over the last ten (10) years which is expected to continue.  Please provide any recommended changes to the SIR that will allow the FAA and the Service Provider to realize benefit from additional behavior change and/or improvements in technology.
3.	Please discuss any concerns you have relative to the affordability profile presented in Section L.17. Please discuss, conceptually, suggestions of how a pay down schedule of non-recurring costs could be structured.
4.	Please discuss if and when a 65% reduction in FAA Operation Cost is achievable.  If the governments affordability profile were increased, would the increase impact your ability to achieve the FAAs cost reduction objectives?  Please explain.
5.	Please identify any requirements in the Draft SIR that you believe may drive a higher cost or a delay to transition. Please provide your suggestions for alternate requirements.  
6.	Are the transition requirements and the transition constraints sufficient for you to develop the transition plan?
7.	Please provide any suggestions for the test program requirements including the appropriate level of rigor for this service while not creating delay and/or excessive cost.
8.	Do the FAA Security requirements constrain your solution or hinder the ability to achieve the stated FAA cost reduction objectives?  Please discuss the specific security controls that will constrain your solution.  Please discuss any specific recommendations you have to address the stated concerns.
9.	Do you recommend changes to or additional Acceptable Performance Levels (APL)? Will the APLs ensure performance is met?  Do the APLs affect your ability to innovate or the ability to meet the FAAs stated objectives?  Based on your experience with call centers, what are your recommended APLs on measurements such as utilization and occupancy?  Are there other APLs that should be considered?
10.	Please provide recommendations for specifying service availability.  Please provide any recommendations for specifying operational contingency.
11.	Please provide any recommendations for additional flexibility in the contract structure.  
12.	The FAA is considering implementation of a Centralized Flight Planning service. Please discuss any impacts of this service to your proposed solution and/or business model.
13.	Please provide any specific orders, policy and/or guidance changes that you recommend the FAA consider and describe how the change to the order, policy and/or guidance will impact your proposed solution and the FAAs FFSP acquisition objectives.  
14.	 The FAA has provided additional transactional data in the Draft SIR.  Does the transactional data provided in the Draft SIR provide enough information for you to develop your solution and proposal?
15.	What would be the impact to your solution and cost proposal if the FAA were to require additional workload data such as time spent on discrete transactions (e.g. flight plans, standard briefings, etc. per call), and pilot metrics.
16.	The Service Contract Act (SCA) will apply to the FFSP acquisition.  SCA wage rates for Flight Service Specialist (FSS) were reviewed on numerous occasions by the Department of Labor (DOL) and in a May 21, 2007 Decision, the DOL concluded that issuance of a specialized SCA wage determination to cover the FSS working on the current AFSS contract was appropriate. 

The job category currently listed in the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, 29000 Technical Occupations, 29011 Air Traffic Control Specialist  Station, is the minimum wage established by the DOL: 

Wage and Hour Division (WHD)

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
<p><br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis without providing for full and open competition to RuRo Inc. 321 Ballenger Center Drive, Suite 102, Frederick, Maryland 21703 to procure the following, (Brand Name: RuRo Inc.):</p>
<p>THIS IS A FOLLOW-ON REQUIREMENT</p>
<p>IT SECURITY PROVISIONS AND 508 COMPLIANCE LANGUAGE IS ALREADY OBTAINED FROM PREVIOUS CONTRACT.</p>
<p>Procurement:</p>
<p>1. UDPics: Premium Support Service, Onsite -Liaison resource portion of service to be de- ployed onsite at UDP as needed to maximize service efficacy: Liaison "A" skillet: bioinformatics expertise, minor-moderate applicable scripting.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. The National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. A longstanding medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program. The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The UDP was established to evaluate participants who have undiagnosed medical conditions.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objective:</p>
<p>The UDP program makes use of a diverse set of diagnostic and research techniques both to attempt to find a diagnosis and to generate research projects to advance medical knowledge. Ruro, Inc. has developed the enterprise-grade LIMS 24/7 web platform called UDPics that encompasses project, task and asset management; user role configurability; user-tailored report; extensive audit functionality and information security that is required by the UDP laboratory. This system has been designed to be the meeting place of laboratory software tools, laboratory hardware, and staff users, allowing previously impossible levels of secure data access, communication and process efficiency. A collaboration portal of the UDPics system has been designed for outside collaborators to add necessary experimental reports into the system for NIH UDP employees to access and incorporate into the experimental workflow of UDP patients to elucidate the cause of disease.</p>
<p>Other Important Considerations:</p>
<p>UDPics is a patient data system for NHGRI-Undiagnosed Diseases Program and requires constant upgrades, hosting and monitoring of the system. Ruro, Inc. has produced the LIMS 24/7 software platform that is designed for the simplification and greater efficiency of laboratory sample, data and process management. They have currently designed a specific LIMS 24/7 platform for the NIH UDP called UDPics. This system has created a method of combining all bioinformatics processes that are used in the Undiagnosed Diseases Program for laboratory and clinical personnel to work collaboratively and efficiently. The UDP requires further refinement of UDPics that requires Premium Support Service offered by Ruro, Inc. that includes a liaison designated for the UDP to perform refinement of UDPics and to rectify any problems that may appear in the system in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>&bull; UDPics Premium Onsite Support Service:</p>
<p>o Liaison resource to be deployed onsite at UDP as needed to maximize service efficacy;<br />o RuRo HQ service resources to be identified by liaison in a task by task basis;<br />o Services driven by deadline/milestone agreement;<br />o Priority assignment as needed to maximize efficacy;<br />o Liaison must be offer RuRo support, bioinformatic expertise, and be capable of minor to moderate applicable scripting; and<br />o RuRo support and engineering resource priority status will be managed by liaison.<br />Place of Performance:</p>
<p>The work will be performed at NHGRI Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDPics Patient Data System)</p>
<p>Deliverables:</p>
<p>Report on analysis will be provided.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (SSC Pacific), intends to issue Request for Proposal (RFP) No. N66001-17-R-0291 for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Information Operations (ISR/IO) Systems Engineering, Software Development, Test and Evaluation support services. SSC Pacific requires contractor expertise in systems engineering, software development, project administration, and program management in support of the design, development, integration, test and evaluation, user training, and life cycle support of mission-critical systems and their supporting technologies. These programs include effort in the following areas: (1) systems engineering; (2) prototype development and logistics support; (3) software system engineering, design and development; (4) software configuration management, test and evaluation; and (5) software engineering approach.
The anticipated action will include multiple indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts with cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) pricing. The period of performance will include a two-year base period and one three-year option period. The estimated level of effort is 72,000 hours per year with an estimated total dollar value of $49,993,905. Awardees of contracts under this solicitation will compete for orders pursuant to the ordering process at FAR 16.505(b). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 Engineering Services, and the Small Business Size Standard is $38.5M. Security classification will vary from Unclassified to SECRET classification. This requirement will be fulfilled using full and open competition with incentives for small business participation at the prime and/or subcontract level. This requirement is a follow-on to an unrestricted solicitation that resulted in the award of the following five contracts: N66001-12-D-0083, General Dynamics Information Technology; N66001-12-D-0084, Engility Corp.; N66001- 12-D-0085, Northrop Grumman Defense Mission Systems, N66001-12-D-0086, Science Applications International Corp.; and N66001-12-D-0087, Stanley Associations, Inc.  The ordering period of the predecessor MAC is 10 February 2012 to 09 February 2017.
For this requirement, a market survey to determine small business capability was posted on SPAWAR e-Commerce Central on 14 July 2016, reference number MKSTVY-1236DA. Based on the evaluations of the responses to the market survey, SSC Pacific intends to compete the requirement on an unrestricted basis (i.e. full and open competition). The requirement is described in the Statement of Work (SOW).
It is currently anticipated that RFP N66001-17-R-0291 will be released in December 2016. The solicitation will only be available electronically. Electronic copies of the RFP may be obtained from the SPAWAR E-Commerce website at https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil under SSC Pacific "Open Solicitations."

<DESC><p>SOURCES SOUGHT</p>
<p>External Overt/Covert Lighting System for KC-135R/T Aircraft</p>
<p>PURPOSE<br />The Legacy Tanker Division Contracting Office, Tinker AFB, OK, is conducting market research to determine interested parties, estimated cost, schedule, and performance parameters to replace the existing exterior lights on the KC-135 with Light Emitting Diode (LED) lights providing both Overt and Covert functionality. Installation of the new lights should not require the replacement of the existing aircraft wiring.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION<br />KC-135 exterior lighting is not Military Specification (Mil Spec) MIL-L-6503H compliant, a deficiency verified by recent ground testing. Replacing the current lighting with Light Emitting Diode (LED) lighting will provide better aircraft visual acquisition and comply with exterior lighting requirements. KC-135 combat and peacetime operations benefit in three areas: safety, survivability, and sustainability. LED lighting will provide tactical advantages due to KC-135 visual and infrared (IR) signature adjustments. A narrower visual spectrum with both overt and covert lighting capability will enhance threat mitigation and fratricide prevention during current and future contingency operations. Increased mean time between failures (MTBF) of LED bulb life over current bulbs will decrease supply costs and maintenance man-hours which will be financially beneficial over the aircraft life cycle.</p>
<p>The KC-135 performs aerial refueling for both hard point (boom) and drogue (Multipoint refueling and boom drogue adapter) systems. The external lighting on the KC-135 is incandescent light bulbs that have low reliability and no longer meet current FAA requirements for position lighting. The Legacy Tanker Division is looking for interested parties to develop, design, and manufacture replacement lighting that is Light Emitting Diode (LED) based that performs the functions of overt and covert lighting during normal operations (day and night) and during aerial refueling with all receivers currently being refueled by the KC-135. The lighting system is expected to be tested at Edwards AFB, CA for both overt and covert operations during normal and refueling mission scenarios.</p>
<p>The LED lights must meet the following Environmental Requirements:<br />Explosive Atmosphere, Temperature and Altitude, Temperature Variations, Vibration, Shock, Humidity, Crash Safety, Waterproofness, Sand and Dust, Magnetic Effects, Electromagnetic Interference and Compatibility.</p>
<p>External lights affected by this effort are: Wing Tip Navigation Lights (2 ea), Underwing Illumination Lights (2 ea), Anti-collision lights (2 ea), Tail Position Light (2 ea - white/green), Pilot Director Lights (2 strings of 8 lights each), Air Refueling Flood Light (1 ea), Lower Stabilizer Lights MPRS Basket Illumination (2 ea), Multi-point Refueling System (MPRS) Pod Lights (2 ea), the Boom Marker Lights (2 ea), Under Body Lights (2 ea) and the Scanning Lights (2 ea)</p>
<p><br />NOTE: The lighting system must maintain interoperability with the existing system power, components and configuration to ensure the ability to interface with existing systems without degrading current capability.</p>

<DESC>PURPOSE: The Program Executive Office Ground Combat Systems (PEO GCS) is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support requirements for industrial base assessments and studies. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement.
<p>BACKGROUND: Significant capability, capacity, and cost impacts are being placed on defense programs. These impacts could in the short term have dire consequences to manufacturers, resulting in major losses of critical industrial base sectors and suppliers along with potentially impacting core workload at depots and arsenals. U.S. Army policymakers must develop overarching strategies that will sustain, preserve and retain the defense industrial base. <br />SCOPE: PEO GCS is contemplating awarding multiple call orders for varying industrial base projects described below. The effort will involve extremely detailed and complex analyses through multiple layers of data, reports and studies held at a multitude of Original Equipment Manufacturers' (OEM's) sites, PEO's, arsenals, depots, other U.S. Army and Department of Defense (DOD) agencies, and the multiple tiered vendor bases supporting these organizations. The data gained from these requirements will provide the U.S. Army with the ability to independently assess current state and reduce or prioritize the budget across the Army's industrial base. Areas of potential interest include but are not limited to the following:<br /><br />1. Strategic planning, program evaluation, monitoring and measurement. <br />2.

<DESC><br />INTRODUCTION:<br />This Sources Sought notice is for informational and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Solicitation and is not to be considered as a commitment by the Government. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request that will be considered for contract award. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only, no solicitation documents exist at this time. This is strictly market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research. Neither the US Army Cyber School nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this demonstration. The NAICS Code for this requirement is 511210.<br />The US Army Cyber School is interested in understanding currently available technologies that may enhance the hands-on application of skills and knowledge in a culminating event. Specific areas of interest for this sources sought include 1) Virtualized target network infrastructure, 2) Target entities, 3) Network traffic generation, 4) Auto-grading, 5) Artificial Intelligence/Student assistance, 6) Operational relevance, 7) Incorporation of physical domain
<p>GENERAL BACKGROUND:<br />The US Army Cyber School is creating curriculum that provides world-class technical training for 17* series (17A, 17C, and 170A) personnel that perform in both Offensive and Defensive Cyberspace Operational work roles. Hands-on application of skills and knowledge gained from instruction in a culminating event that closely parallels the Operational Environment is a critical component of the US Army Cyber School's approach to training all 17* series personnel. It is the intent of the US Army Cyber School to provide all training, to include culminating events, in a setting that fosters adult learning, dynamic problem-solving, and critical thinking, all of which prepare 17 series personnel for the highly technical missions they will be serving in upon graduation.</p>
<p>SPECIFIC INFORMATION OF INTEREST:<br />1) Virtualized target network infrastructure: The virtualized network for the culminating event must be dynamic in that the instructor should be able to make modifications in near-real-time. The infrastructure should consist of a variety of hosts with various operating systems, servers, routers, switches, and firewalls.</p>
<p>2) Target entities: Target entities must include various adversarial organizations (military, government, terror, and criminal) and persona that employ a variety of offensive and defensive tools and techniques. Additionally, target entities must have a variety of vulnerabilities unique to each to avoid a single solution that works across the board.</p>
<p>3) Network traffic generation: Network traffic must not only mimic the "noise" generally encountered on a network, but must also include clear, encrypted, and obfuscated textual and data traffic that emulates conversations, transactions, file-sharing, malicious code, attacks, and reconnaissance that relate to a greater underlying scenario storyline.</p>
<p><br />4) Auto-grading: An auto-grading system is required to optimize the flow of training, provide near instant feedback to the student, and to identify student shortfalls in near-real-time.</p>
<p>5) Artificial Intelligence/Student Assistance: An artificial intelligence system is required to provide a dynamic target that adapts to student input; poorly executed tasks may cause additional work based on the AI's reaction to the input. Also, a student assistant is required to facilitate adult learning and to optimize instruction time for concepts that involve higher instructor-to-student interaction.</p>
<p>6) Operational Relevance: Tasks completed during the culminating event must be intertwined with planning, intelligence, and effects delivery, assessment of effectiveness, defensive actions, and reporting of information, actions, and shortfalls to a higher headquarters within established timelines.</p>
<p>7) Incorporation of the Physical Domain: Activities conducted in the logical domain should have some interconnection with the physical domain. This may involve sending a team to conduct reconnaissance, collection, and/or attack against a wireless target in a distant location, to performing malicious code injection against a portable device within the classroom that represents a host, server, network device, or Industrial Control System.</p>
<p>Potential offerors having the skills, experience, professional qualifications, and capabilities necessary to perform the described requirement are invited to provide a capabilities statement via e-mail. The Capability statements shall not exceed ten (10) pages and must include the following: 1) Company name and Point of Contact information (address, telephone, e-mail, web-site, etc.); 2) DUNS number and CAGE code; 3) Small Business Size/Certification (to include 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, etc.); and 4) Familiarity and knowledge of the requirement.</p>
<p>Responses are due no later than 09:00 am, Friday, 4 November 2016, and shall be electronically submitted to shannon.l.mccauley3.civ@mail.mil. All responses will be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a potential future acquisition. Response is strictly voluntary; no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requests.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.2.3.1.2.1  the purpose of this SIR is to obtain information, which will ultimately allow the FAA to identify an Offeror that provides the best value, make a selection decision and award a contract.  

The current flight procedure tracking system utilized by Mission Support Services (MSS) AIS group is the Automated Procedures Tracking System (APTS). APTS was developed over ten (10) years ago using Java and the commercial off the shelf (COTS) Oracle Workflow product. The application enabled AIS to implement their quality-controlled process for instrument flight procedure (IFP) development, tracking work from initial request through publication of the procedure on a specified chart date.
 
The APTS tool is heavily integrated with aeronautical authoritative data sources. These authoritative data sources are managed by applications (e.g. SIAP, FIX) used by AIS. When a user wants to modify these data for their project, the various authoritative sources query APTS to determine if the user is authorized (e.g. owns the work, the work is at the correct step in the process) to make the changes. This singular point of control ensures that all authoritative sources operate the same way across the enterprise and that the data is tightly controlled, limiting changes that may unknowingly break other flight procedures projects that use the same data.

The APWS is a planned technical refresh to modernize the existing APTS application. This is a software and integration effort that will meet the requirements and needs of Mission Support Services as they track their ISO process for IFP development. 

The APWS application will: 
1.	Provide a single, unified view for tracking IFP development from request through publication;
2.	Interface with the existing applications, both internal and external to the Instrument Flight Procedures Automation (IFPA) application suite; and
3.	Integrate with authoritative data sources.

The Contractor must perform software engineering tasks for the development, evaluation, support, and maintenance of all software and associated documentation that include analysis, design, development, change implementation, and system test and evaluation. The following general task area descriptions are indicative of the work required in order to provide systems engineering support. The ordering of the task descriptions should not be viewed as a prioritization of the Contractor support requirements.

The contract will be awarded on a tiered competitive basis.  

Tier 1 will be conducted as an 8(a) set-aside.  If there are sufficient 8(a) responses to conduct a competitive procurement the FAA intends to award a single contract resulting from this Screening Information Request (SIR).

Tier 2 will be conducted as a small business set-aside.  If there are sufficient small business responses to conduct a competitive procurement the FAA intends to award a single contract resulting from this SIR.

Tier 3 will be conducted as a full and open competition.

The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standard code for this requirement is 541511, Software analysis and design services, custom computer with a size standard of $27.5 Million.

The Offeror's completed proposal must be submitted no later than 2:00 P.M. local time on October 26, 2016 following the instructions in the attached SIR.

Prospective offerors are hereby on notice that any amendment(s) issued to this solicitation will be published at http://faaco.faa.gov.  It is the Offerors' responsibility to visit this website frequently for updates on this procurement.  If an amendment is issued and the offeror does not acknowledge it, the offeror may be considered non-responsive to the solicitation.  All amendments must be acknowledged.                                                   .  

The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to the SIR, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY/SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the RFI/Sources Sought notice or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a quote. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government.</p>
<p>The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting information, on behalf of the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for Charter Vessel Support Services.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement 541712, with a size standard of 500 Employees. This RFI/Sources Sought will be used solely for market research and does not constitute a solicitation.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) requires Contractor support in one or more areas of scientific investigation. Both recently enacted and pending management actions by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council have resulted in considerable reductions in availability of fishery dependent data for many fish species in the snapper-grouper complex, resulting in an increased need for Fishery Independent (FI) data. As a result, the NOAA Fisheries Southeast Fisheries Science Center initiated FI survey efforts in the Southeast U.S. (SEUS) waters in Fiscal Year 10. Since 2010, 45-50 days at sea per fiscal year have been accomplished in SEUS waters using a contracted vessel. The anticipated period of performance for this requirement is June 1, 2017 through May 31, 2018 and four (1) one year option periods.</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to collect fishery independent data on reef fish resources in in SEUS waters. Contract cruise operations in 2017-2021 shall require 40 days at-sea each year. Contingent upon funding, additional days at-sea may be required each year. The Contractor shall provide the following at-sea tasks during Charter Vessel Services during multiple multi-day cruises. The vessel shall be ported out of Savannah, GA:</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct stationary camera surveys of reef fish resources;<br />&bull; Collect reef fish using chevron fish traps, with ice/cold storage available;<br />&bull; Conduct total water column CTD profiles;<br />&bull; Process and store fish samples for transport to on-shore laboratories (wet lab operations, with frozen storage available); <br />&bull; At-sea sensor data collection and manual data entry (dry lab operations, supported by a marine/survey technician);<br />&bull; Deploy and retrieve independent project sampling gears as needed (e.g., longline gear, autonomous underwater vehicles, portable sonars, acoustic receiver hydrophones); and<br />&bull; At-sea operations shall involve visiting up to 30 discrete sites per day, requiring vessel idling for gear deployment (traps, cameras, and CTD) and retrieval during daylight hours and potentially at night. Stations depths are expected to range from ~ 15-120 m. Ship personnel/crew shall be required to assist with gear deployment and retrieval using a hydraulic pot hauler. Scientific personnel will operate up to 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>&bull; The Vessel requirements include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>o Vessel length must not be less than 90 feet; <br />o Maximum cruising speed must not be less than nine (9) knots;<br />o Must accommodate up to 12 scientific personnel not including crew; <br />o Vessel must have 600 square feet of back deck space to accommodate traps, lines, buoys, coolers, and other sampling gear.</p>
<p>The DOC/NOAA is seeking the following information:</p>
<p>Potential respondents shall provide a capability statement addressing the above requirements and also shall provide business size status for the NAICS Code stated above. In addition to size status, please provide your company's socio-economic status, if applicable, for the NAICS code stated above (8(a), Hubzone, Small Disadvantaged Business, Service-Disabled/Veteran Owned, and Women Owned).</p>
<p>Note: This announcement is a Request for Information and no contract will be awarded pursuant to this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied, or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. The response date for this Request for Information is November 8, 2016 at 12:00 P.M. No collect calls will be accepted. All responses to this RFI may be submitted via e-mail to Roberta Smith, Contract Specialist, at roberta.h.smith@noaa.gov. NO TELEPHONE RESPONSES WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND/PURPOSE/TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Lakehurst, in conjunction with NAWC-AD Patuxent River, MD (AD-5.0X) AIRWorks&nbsp;are soliciting information and comments from industry on its ability to provide a non-developmental or Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) avionics digital direction finding (DF) system to be installed on a C-27J surveillance aircraft. The DF will need to operate on a fixed wing aircraft and have the capability to receive and provide bearing of Ultra High Frequency (UHF), Very High Frequency (VHF-AM, VHF-FM), and 406 MHz Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) transmitters throughout a full 360-degree azimuth. Additionally, the DF system will need the ability to select, scan, and provide bearing information to transmitters transmitting on international distress frequencies 121.5, 243.0, and 156.8, and on 406 MHz for EPIRB signals. Additionally, the DF system must have the ability to monitor 406MHz independently of other signals. When displaying International 406 MHz Cospas/ Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) EPIRB information, digital data (including registration number, beacon identification, country code, and latitude/longitude) will need to be displayed and an audible tone must be active during homing. The system must determine LOB relative to the Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) heading with an accuracy of &le; 10 degrees. All equipment should already be certified for airworthiness on military fixed wing aircraft or carry a commercial supplemental type certification (STC).</p>

If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, and if subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of the effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large business subcontractors will be used.

Documentation of technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition. Standard company brochures will not be reviewed. Submissions are not to exceed five (5) typewritten pages in no less than 12 font size.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in November.   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />The Open Period for November* is November 1, 2016 to November 7, 2016, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2017 or until it is replaced.
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2016, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2017 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY17 AAAP RLP Package and  each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 16-Reg6 and must be located within Region 6.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years.</p>

It is the Government's intention to structure the SATOC as a three year base with (2) two option years for a maximum possible award total of eight million dollars ($8.0M) over a five year period. The Government plans to solicit a single solicitation resulting in the award of a single SATOC. The purpose of the contract is to provide electrical design improvements and upgrades to WA facilities to increase their reliability and improve their function.</p>
<p>The Washington Aqueduct serves the National Capital Region by directly providing potable water to its three wholesale customers - DC Water, Arlington County and Fairfax County, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Washington Aqueduct's water supply also serves the Pentagon, Arlington National Cemetery and Reagan National Airport. The Washington Aqueduct is the sole source of potable water supply to most of the one million customers and is direct funded through wholesale water purchases by its customers, not appropriated funds.</p>

Therefore, an experienced contractor with resources and expertise to handle the following project constraints is needed:</p>
<p>i. The work has to be carefully sequenced and conducted in phases to ensure minimal impact to water production. <br />ii. The Contractor will have to carefully plan his work, especially outages impacting plant operations, such that any outage is no more than 6 hours in duration. <br />iii. The Contractor shall provide temporary power to vital equipment during outages so that chemical feeds and monitoring is not disrupted.<br />iv. The Contractor shall plan for and execute his work such that, in case of an emergency, impacted equipment could be returned to service within 4 hours.<br />v. The Contractor will be working in limited interior spaces and around equipment that must remain operational during execution of work under this contract.</p>
<p>Interested qualified Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned SB (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZones), or Qualified Section 8(a) certified firms should submit a concise narrative and specific project examples of similar size and scope that demonstrate their specialized experience and technical competence in:</p>

Requisition No.:   648-17-1-066-0017   Date of Notice:    10/31/2016  

Contracting Officer:  DIANA CURL    Closing Date:       11/08/2016    

This notice will appear for 8 days from above date.  
**************************************************************************************
Description of Supplies/Services:  

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Portland VA Medical Center (PVAMC), requires services, non   personal, for reference laboratory services with professional interpretation of test results performed in the reference lab, all in support of direct patient care.  The estimated length of this contract will be 1 year with 4 option years.
The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively to The Mayo Clinic IAW FAR 13.106-1(b) (1) (i).  The authority for restricting competition on this procurement is under 41 U.S.C Code 1901, as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) for acquisitions of commercial items pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.5. 
The Reference Laboratory shall provide in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations, laws, and ordinances, and in accordance with the specifications outlined for accreditation certification if applicable, patient specimen testing for the tests listed below.  Reference lab will provide the test results to PLMS PVAMC.

Mayo is the only US lab that can perform these tests.  VA requirements specify that all reference laboratories used by VA labs must be US.  A delay in this service will have a direct, negative impact on Veteran patient care by delaying lab results for disease confirmation and identification and the follow on medical care.  The government s technical experts conducted a search of local and national laboratories in the October 2016 timeframe for potential sources that can compete for the required services.  There were labs that could perform a portion of the test, but no other US laboratory had the capabilities needed to perform the entire required test.  Only, Mayo, as the current contractor, possesses the technical expertise and can meet the location requirements specific to the PVAMC.  Based on this market research, the government s technical experts determined that Mayo is the only contractor that can meet the government s requirements.
Due to the highly specialized nature of the services being acquired, The Mayo Clinic is the only contractor capable of providing the services described above without the Veteran s Health Administration experiencing substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable delays that could not be expected to be recovered through competition.
Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these services shall submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  This is NOT an RFQ.  This does represent the Government s only written notice of this procurement. All responsible sources may submit a response which, if timely received, must be considered by the agency. 

The estimated/potential:  $426,000.00
Place of Performance:   Portland, OR

<p>Defense Contract Management Agency Information Technology Directorate (DCMA-IT) has a requirement for a task management software solution capable of hosting 1500 DCMA users. This solution shall provide centralization, automation, security and tracking of all internal and external agency tasks; thus eliminating inefficiencies of having to utilize multiple IT programs and applications to process, coordinate and complete required staffing of tasks. Services include installation, configuration, test and training on software and an annual software maintenance package.

<p>DCMA requires a task management solution that has the capability to provide a programming interface which currently integrates Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise data-services and scalable collaboration capabilities for task management synchronization across DoD components. The cross component connectivity is necessary in order to establish and link communication between DCMA, the Office of the Secretary of Defense(OSD), Air Force, Navy and Army.</p>
<p>Duration of the contract shall be a one Base Year plus four one year options.</p>
<p>Authority-FAR 13.501(a), Sole Source.</p>
<p>The Government's intent is to solicit and award this requirement to Accenture Federal Services LLC. Competition has been restricted due to the proprietary nature of the requirement. No sources were located that were technically acceptable without having to create a specialized alternative creating additional costs to the Government. It has thus been determined that it is in the Government's best interest to award this requirement as a sole source action.</p>
<p>A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE POSTED. The Government intends to proceed with this sole source action. The NAICS code is 511210 "software Publishers" The size standard as defined by the U.S. Small Business Administration is $38.5M.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency.

Oral communications are NOT ACCEPTABLE in response to this notice. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the government. Responses and questions shall be submitted to Tammie Lett-Chalmers at Tammie.Lett-Chalmers@dcma.mil. The Defense Contract Management Agency is not responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command proposes to issue a sole source contract to Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS), 1151 E. Hermans Road, Tucson, Arizona 85767, CAGE Code 15090. This effort is to provide engineering services in support of the Stinger Weapon System for both United States (US) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) on behalf of the Cruise Missile Defense System (CMDS) Project Office, Stinger Based Systems (SBS) Product Office. RMS will be responsible for complex system engineering support, manufacturing support, test equipment support, logistical support and other support associated with the production, test, fielding and sustainment of the Stinger missiles and associated launchers, field test equipment, and documentation. Per FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A) and (B), for DoD, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and/or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. RMS is the only available source with the appropriate technical expertise, corporate knowledge, specialized skills and trained workforce to perform the required effort in the required timeframe. Due to the long term and highly integrated involvement of RMS in STINGER field support, upgrade development, production, FMS production, and support, it is not feasible to procure this effort from another sources. Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which will be considered by the agency to dewayne.kendricks.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Bone Cement Kit. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Bone Cement Kit products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Bone Cement Kit in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Bone Cement Kit will be established approximately February 2017 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately March 2017 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Bone Cement Kit. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Bone Cement Kit.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Bone Cement Kit. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $242,609.91. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Four items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 69.80% ($169,346.20) of the total volume in sales ($242,609.91).The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 4:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;<br />(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;<br />(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

<p><br />b.  Past Performance:</p>
<p>Past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the vendor to successfully meet the requirements of this solicitation. Vendors are required to provide information on no more than five (5) of the firm's most recently completed contracts/orders (not to exceed five (5) years since completion) for like or similar work. Vendors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.</p>
<p>Each Vendor shall submit, in writing, information on past performance (Attachment 02). Vendors shall provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation. The Vendor is required to send Attachment 02, Past Performance Questionnaire, to those government and commercial activities provided by the vendor's in their submission.  The information shall be completed by the references who will then forward the completed questionnaires:</p>
<p>James Rall<br /> james.rall@noaa.gov (Cc andrew.hildebrandt@noaa.gov) <br /> U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA/ERAD</p>
<p>The Government will not accept Questionnaires directly from the vendors, only Questionnaires submitted on time and from vendor's references will be accepted.</p>
<p>The Government will conduct a past performance evaluation based upon the past performance of the vendor as it relates to the probability of vendor to provide the Government with quality service as covered within the solicitation.</p>
<p>Vendors are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government. The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry. This information may include Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS); Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) reports, the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity System (FAPIIS), or past performance information from any source.</p>
<p>The burden of providing thorough, complete, and relevant past performance information rests with the vendor.  Any Past Performance Questionnaire(s) received at the Government office designated herein after the exact time specified for receipt of past performance information is "late" and may not be considered for evaluation.  If the vendor possess no relevant past performance, it should affirmatively state so in the quote.</p>
<p>Vendors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance. A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably. However, the submission with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous submission to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful submission when compared to the submissions of other Vendors having an satisfactory (or better) past performance.</p>
<p>c.  Price: The vendor shall submit a FFP quote for Line Item (CLIN) 0001 based on a 50 mile move from the AOC location.</p>
<p>52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items. (Oct 2014)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>&bull;	Technical <br />&bull;	Past Performance<br />&bull;	Price</p>
<p>Technical Approach and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. However, the Government will not award at significantly higher prices to only achieve slightly better performance. The Government will assess the benefits or better performance versus the added price through trade-off analysis. As non-price factors become equal-price becomes increasingly important.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<DESC>Beginning in March of 2014, West Africa experienced the largest Ebola virus disease (Ebola) outbreak on record. Unlike many smaller preceding Ebola outbreaks, this one spread to multiple African countries and caused over 22,000 suspected human cases. In August 2014, the first American Ebola patient was flown to the United States (U.S.) for treatment. Additional patients were subsequently medically-evacuated to the U.S., and two returned travelers were diagnosed and treated. These experiences, as well as the secondary infections of two health care workers in a Dallas hospital, and the experience of needing to quarantine and monitor multiple individuals who treated patients in Africa, identified opportunities to improve preparedness for, and treatment of, suspected and confirmed patients with Ebola.
<p>In response, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Office of Emergency Management, Division of National Healthcare Preparedness Programs (HPP) seeks to award a contract to provide training and quarantine services in a Training, Simulation and Quarantine Center (TSQC) to train USG and other appropriate personnel for another outbreak of Ebola or other highly pathogenic disease (hereafter referred to as "Ebola") and to provide a facility to quarantine individuals exposed to such diseases.</p>
<p>ASPR requires a contractor to provide the following to the U.S. Government (USG):</p>
<p>1) Training curricula to use in providing simulated and virtual reality clinical training to health care personnel treating individuals with Ebola or other highly pathogenic diseases;</p>
<p>2) Training of USG staff and appropriate personnel on the areas mentioned above; and</p>
<p>3) Provide a total of 30 days of continuous quarantine and monitoring for up to twenty (20) individuals who are identified by the USG for monitoring during potential or actual outbreaks. Once the USG identifies the need for quarantine, all other uses of the entire quarantine space must cease and be used only for quarantine.<br /><br />Contractor(s) include those U.S. hospitals that have safely and successfully  cared for patients with Ebola, for the full duration of their illness, in the U.S. Additionally, the contractor will be responsible for furnishing a facility, including (if necessary) all necessary design and construction costs of the training and quarantine facility; ASPR will purchase  training curricula development,  equipment necessary to provide clinical simulation training to federal medical teams, the  quarantine and monitoring  of individuals potentially exposed to highly infectious diseases, and quarantine exercises.  ASPR reserves the right to consider multiple contractors to ensure training and quarantine capabilities.</p>
<p>The period of performance for the contract will not exceed 25 years and will consist of one (1) base period of four (4) years and up to twenty one (21), one year option periods.  Based on the nature, quality and value of proposals received, ASPR/HPP may fund more than one contract.</p>

<p><br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p><br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>

<p>Petroleum Coke Utilization:  The Indian Oil Corporation Limited ("Grantee") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Grantee that will assist the Grantee review options to economically convert refinery byproducts, specifically petroleum coke (petcoke), into various chemical products or fuels that would be used for transportation and power generation.</p>
<p>Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) is India's largest public sector undertaking (PSU) accounting for approximately half of the country's refining capacity. IOCL currently operates nine refineries (Guwahati, Barauni, Koyali (Gujarat), Haldia, Mathura, Panipat, Bongaigaon, Digboi, and Paradip), except Mathura Refinery all other Refineries have coke producing capability. IOCL's coke production will almost double between 2015 and 2018 with the commissioning of two new delayed coker units at the Haldia and Paradip Refineries. At the same time environmental emission standards are becoming more stringent, and given this scenario IOCL will be producing an excess amount of petcoke. Thus both economic considerations and environmental compliance constraints means that IOCL must alleviate its excess petcoke situation starting around 2018.</p>
<p>IOCL requires a detailed feasibility study (FS) to review options to economically convert refinery byproducts into various chemical products or fuels that would be used for transportation and power generation.  The FS will include an analysis and forecast of the international, regional, and domestic demand for petcoke, a review of applicable regulations that will influence the consumption of petcoke and the implementation of any petcoke-based project in India, as well as a model capable of simulating the technical and economic options that are available to IOCL.  In particular, the company is interested in technologies to convert petcoke into other chemical products or fuels that would be used for transportation and/or power generation.  Several options are available to IOCL to complete this process, which can be integrated directly into its refinery operations.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $744,675 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.

The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Deputy Country Representative - Macedonia - is a member of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Europe and Asia (E&amp;A) Regional Team, and reports to the OTI Country Representative in Macedonia.</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of USAID/OTI's Macedonia country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to support the OTI Country Representative with managing an implementing partner and may be called upon to represent OTI's program to local partners, senior-level U.S. government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>Aligned with USG policy priorities, USAID/OTI's program supports greater civic engagement and public awareness through media programming and related outreach activities. The USAID/OTI program coordinates with, and complements, other USAID and Department of State assistance efforts, as well as those of other donors.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the DCHA/OTI Country Representative or his/her designee, the Deputy Country Representative will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with USG agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by Embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick impact programming model. Support to Embassies and USAID Missions may also include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming, including but not limited to rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups, many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	If required, travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull;	Mentor/train other OTI and implementing partner field staff as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as Acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	As appropriate, communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, the US Embassy, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Support the Country Representative to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation, 2) OTI contractor performance, 3) Foreign Service National (FSN) staff support needs and morale, 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other U.S. Government entities, 5) security concerns, 6) relations with local partners, including local, state and national government representatives, and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising the Foreign Service National Staff, including but not limited to program officers, administrative assistants and drivers;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff as delegated by the Country Representative (e.g. Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Administrative Assistants, etc.). Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests; and</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other related duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.<br /> <br />SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will be supervised by the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee in the country of assignment. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI/Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes. Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will set overall objectives and resources available, and work with the employee to develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The employee will be responsible for planning and carrying out assignments, resolving most conflicts, coordinating with others, and interpreting policy in terms of established objectives. Keeping the supervisor informed of progress, the employee may determine the approach to be taken and the methodology to be used. The supervisor will review completed work from an overall standpoint of feasibility, compatibility with other work, or effectiveness in meeting requirements.</p>
<p>10.	PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>PHYSICAL DEMANDS:<br />While in Macedonia, the work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. However, the position also requires travel throughout the country of assignment, which may involve some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>WORK ENVIRONMENT:<br />While in Macedonia, the work is primarily performed in an office setting.

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers (Combined Synopsis/Solicitation VA249-17-Q-0004)
During the site visit we were told that the windows only needed to be washed on the outside; however, the solicitation states that washing should be in the outside AND the inside. Would you clarify, please? The windows need to be washed on the inside and outside.

What is the current contract amount per year? (If possible, who is the incumbent?) There is no current contract in place and no incumbent.

Is there an incumbent and if so who much was the previous contract? There is no incumbent and there was no previous contract for these services. However, Heavenly Sunshine out of Southaven, Mississippi has previously performed the same/similar services for the VAMC Memphis.

The scope says to clean screens but they have no number on the bid? There are no screens.

Are there tie backs on the roof? Yes, per the Engineering department at the VAMC Memphis there are tie backs on the roof.  

Who is the incumbent? There is no incumbent. However, Heavenly Sunshine out of Southaven, Mississippi has previously performed the same/similar services for the VAMC Memphis.

What was the awarded amount? There is no current contract in place. 

What is the current contract number? There is no current contract number. 

On page 8 it states that there is a mandatory training (VA20939). If that is applicable to this solicitation, where do we get that training from (contact info, if available, please)? VA online TMS: https://www.tms.va.gov/learning/user/login.jsp

Who is the incumbent? And how much was that award? There is no incumbent and there is no contract in place so there is no award value to report. However, Heavenly Sunshine out of Southaven, Mississippi has previously performed the same/similar services for the VAMC Memphis.

On page 2 it states that the base year is July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017 but on page 5 it states July 1, 2017. Is the base year as of 2016 or 2017?
The contract s base year begins in 2017 and the period of performance is as follows:
The base year is July 1, 2017 to September 30, 2017
Option Year One: October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2018
Option Year Two: October 1, 2018   September 30, 2019
Option Year Three: October 1, 2019   September 30, 2020
Option Year Four: October 1, 2020   September 30, 2021
If the base year is July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016 should we quote only for the remaining months in the base year? Or for all of the 12 months of the base?
Quotes should be submitted following this period of performance:
The contract s period of performance is as follows:
The base year is July 1, 2017 to September 30, 2017
Option Year One: October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2018
Option Year Two: October 1, 2018   September 30, 2019
Option Year Three: October 1, 2019   September 30, 2020
Option Year Four: October 1, 2020   September 30, 2021
When will work under this contract commence? The work for this contract will commence on July 1, 2017.

Has a contractor performed similar work to this for the government in the past? Yes, Heavenly Sunshine in Southaven, Mississippi.

If available, please provide the incumbent contract number. There was/is not contract in place. However, the company that has previously provided the same/similar work is Heavenly Sunshine in Southaven, Mississippi. 

If you are unable to provide a contract number, is it safe to assume this is a new requirement for the government? This is not a new requirement for the government however it has been five (5) years since last cleaning.

Coulda company still provide a bid response without attending a site visit? Yes.

Is there another site visit scheduled or could be scheduled? Another site visit can be scheduled if necessary but the quote submission date will not change.

Forwarding a proof of shipment and an invoice for payment by the Contractor shall be construed as a<br />certification by the contractor that the items shipped conform to the specifications.<br />c. Notwithstanding any provisions of this clause or any payment made pursuant to the terms of this clause prior<br />to receipt of the items contracted for, the NAFI retains the right to inspect upon receipt and the right to reject<br />nonconforming items. The liability of the Contractor with respect to items for which payments have been<br />made will, after inspection by the NAFI or after the expiration of a reasonable time following delivery to the<br />NAFI within which inspection may be made, whichever occurs first, be limited to exceptions taken at the<br />time of inspection, and latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as amount to fraud.<br />23. VARIATION IN QUANTITY<br />No variation in quantity of any item called for by this contract will be accepted unless authorized by the Contracting<br />Officer.<br />24. PARTIAL DELIVERIES<br />Partial deliveries are not permitted unless authorized by the terms of the contract or approved by the Contracting<br />Officer.<br />Modified 1 January 2015<br />25. PAYMENTS<br />Partial payments will be made when deliveries are authorized or as approved by the Contracting Officer. Payments<br />and penalties for late payments are subject to the requirements established by the Prompt Payment Act, as amended,<br />and as implemented for NAFIs. If the NAFI makes payment but such payment fails to include a prompt payment<br />penalty due to the Contractor within 10 days from when the contract payment is made, penalty amounts will not be<br />paid unless the Contractor makes a written request within forty days after the date of payment.<br />26. DISCOUNTS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT<br />a. Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of offers. However, any offered<br />discount will form a part of the award, and will be taken if payment is made within the discount period<br />indicated in the offer by the offeror. As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction<br />with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices.<br />b. In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the<br />invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date<br />the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the<br />date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be<br />considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds<br />transfer, the specified payment date. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday<br />when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted,<br />payment may be made on the following business day.<br />27. NOTIFICATION OF DEBARMENT/SUSPENSION STATUS<br />The Contractor shall provide immediate notice to the Contracting Officer in the event of being suspended, debarred or<br />declared ineligible by any other Federal Department or agency, or upon receipt of a notice of proposed debarment<br />from another DoD Agency, during the performance of this contract.<br />28. NON WAIVER OF DEFAULTS - Any failure by the NAFI at any time to enforce or require strict performance of<br />any terms or conditions shall not constitute waiver thereof, and shall not affect or impair such terms or conditions in<br />any way or the NAFI's right at any time to avail itself of such remedies as it may have for any breach or breaches of<br />such terms or conditions.<br />29. TRAVEL CLAUSE<br />Contractors and/or their duly appointed representative will make their own travel arrangements, purchase their own<br />tickets, and submit requests for reimbursement to the issuing office found in Block 12 of the award.

The<br />contractor is liable for costs associated with unused or changed airline tickets, where non-use is not caused by the<br />NAFI. Documents are required to support payment of travel costs. The Contracting Officer and or their duly<br />appointed representative will approve, in advance, any changes in the itinerary. Contractors must obtain approval<br />before submitting other than lowest airfare travel reimbursement requests from the invoicing office.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested. This is a Request for Quote and the solicitation number is VA101-17-Q-0259. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-51. This solicitation (see attached file) is targeting only Veterans Owned Small Business (VOSB). 

One of the major duties of Green Management Program Service (GMPS) is to report VA fleet inventory, operational costs, and fuel consumption to GSA, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and DOE. This is accomplished each October through December.  
Federal agencies, including VA, must annually submit to the General Services Administration (GSA) the information needed to produce the Federal Fleet Report (FFR).  GSA s internet-based data collection and reporting system is known as the Federal Automotive Statistical Tool (FAST).  The FAST system is also used by agency fleet managers to provide information to DOE as required by the Energy Policy Act (EPAct), the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) and various Presidential executive orders. In addition, OMB requires agency fleet managers and budget officers to submit agency motor vehicle budgeting information to OMB through FAST.  The bulk of the report is based on the required fleet management data information provided from various offices across VA. Complete and accurate fleet management data is essential for VA to submit a high quality report. This also allows VA to compare trends at a facility, regional, and national level for use in various internal analyses.  
The objective of this project is to assist VA with fleet management data analysis and compiling other related data so that VA can deliver an accurate, timely report to GSA and DOE. This includes quality control and quality assurance of fleet management data.   
Fleet management data for all administrations and staff offices is collected via GSA Fleet Drive Thru and GSA FedFMS.  These databases are available via the internet on GSA s website, and are assessable with log-in protocols.  Contractor can perform duties on or offsite from the VA.
VA intends to acquire the services necessary to satisfy this requirement through limited competitive means - VOSB firm must complete 51 percent of the work. The complete solicitation document file is attached. All questions should be emailed to maina.gakure@va.gov by October 31, 2016 and a response to the questions will be posted by October 31, 2016 as an amendment to the solicitation. The associated NAICS code is 541611. This solicitation closes on November 7th, 2016 at 6:30 am (EST). Point of contact is maina.gakure@va.gov. Interested contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and verified in VIP data base as VOSB

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) REGARDING:
Bell 206B Jet Ranger III Ground Based Training in support of the Chief of Naval Air Trainings (CNATRAs) TH-57B/C Helicopter flight training program.
Summary: The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) is seeking information to support necessary simulation improvements in order to both improve and extend CNATRAs TH-57B/C Helicopter pilot training program until arrival of the Navys Advanced Helicopter Training System (TH-XX).  This effort is independent of TH-XX and is intended to support CNATRAs current TH-57B/C training requirements until TH-XX Ground Based Training System (GBTS) full operational capability.
There is increasing fleet demand for rotary wing aviators.  In order to supply this demand, CNATRA needs to both increase its TH-57B/C GBTS event capacity and simulation fidelity.  The purpose of this RFI is to both provide industry information regarding the Governments efforts and also to gather industry feedback so that the Government can decide upon a course of action.
See attached document for more information.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the <strong>Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP)</strong> in November. <br /> <br /> <br /><strong>HOW TO OFFER:</strong> The Government will use its <strong>Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP)</strong>, located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The <strong>AAAP </strong>will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the <strong>AAAP </strong>website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the <strong>AAAP </strong>homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the <strong>AAAP </strong>website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />The Open Period for November* is <strong>November 1, 2017 to November 7, 2017</strong>, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the <strong>AAAP </strong>website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the <strong>AAAP </strong>program through the remainder of FY 2017 or until it is replaced.
<p><br />* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2016, the <strong>AAAP </strong>application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2017 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY17 <strong>AAAP</strong> RLP Package and  each page within the <strong>AAAP </strong>Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the <strong>AAAP</strong>. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>
<p><br /><strong>DELINEATED AREA: </strong>All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 17-Reg01 and must be located within Region 1 (New England).</p>
<p><br />To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p><br />Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the <strong>AAAP </strong>website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.</p>
<p><br />LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years.</p>
