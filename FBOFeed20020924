<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the renewal of four (4) Gridgen Software License and Maintenance for the period through July 31, 2003 and one option year to start August 1, 2003 through July 31, 2004. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from= =20 Pointwise, Inc., as the only known source that can meet agency requirements.  Pointwise, Inc., is the sole distributor of Gridgen software.  The Gridgen software is currently being used in support of several Hyper-X projects throughout NASA Langley, which is used to generate the grids around the numerical models of flight vehicles.  These grids are the core of Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) research and studies.  Gridgen is a unique, proprietary software.  Should any other software be used, several man years of work would be lost, and have to be repeated.  Such costs could not be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 29, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>Wallace O. Adcox, Contracting Officer, (703) 787-1354
<DESC>Gov.Works on behalf of the U.S. Army Simulation, Training and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM) announces its intention to award a sole source contract to Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) for approximately $367,000 to do performance tests on the Buoyant Stratospheric Vehicle (BSV). The BSV was built progressively over several years by SwRI in concert with a host of Government agencies. The materials and tools used to fabricate and repair the BSV are proprietary to the contractor, and the contractor owns patents on the system. The design of the BSV is unique in its application of a clear Mylar airframe and lightweight, low visibility, long-term self-loitering approach.  The system was developed in support of several government agencies who continue to express interest. Many issues related to the BSV construction, use, and potential application are classified, and not suitable for presentation in this announcement. These facts may be disclosed under proper circumstances to individuals holding appropriate security clearances and proper need-to-know. The period of performance would be from award through January 31, 2003. Firms that believe they can provide the required items and services described above should identify themselves in writing to the Contracting Officer. Such firms must submit supporting evidence in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to meet the stated requirements. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES. Inquiries will only be accepted by fax at (703) 787-1009. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NA Sustainability of Renourishment, Miami Beach, Beach Erosion Control and Hurricane Protection Project, Dade County, FL:  This project entails the placement of sand along Miami Beach in the vicinity of Sixty-third Street to Eighty-third Street using a domest ic source of sand provided by the contractor. Approximately 600,000 cubic yards of material will be required to fill the beach area between monuments DNR-38 to DNR-46.  This segment of beach is approximately 8,700 feet long.  It will have a 205-foot berm w idth from the Erosion Control Line (ECL) at El. 9 MLW with a foreshore slope of 1 Vertical on 15 Horizontal.  A 50-foot wide pipeline corridor, centered at 553,290 North, is provided for placement of fill from the offshore.  Any plan to use a large number of trucks hauling material along the local roads of the beaches will not be acceptable.  The contractor, based upon government criteria, will establish the domestic sand source for this project. The sand must be suitable for Southeast Florida beaches.  It must be free of debris, sharp rocks and pebbles, concrete rubble, and clay.  The average mean grain size shall be equal to or greater than 0.30 mm. (1.74 phi) and less than 0.55mm. (0.86 phi).

Ninety-nine percent of the material must pass the three-eights-inch sieve with no particles larger than three-fourth-inch diameter.  Sand mineralogy of predominantly quartz or calcium carbonate, including oolitic aragonite is acceptable. Rocks will not be separated from the sand on the beach.  The sand shall have a color similar to the existing beach.  Protection of the environment, especially the existing offshore reef system, is very important.  The Contractors operations will have to be carr ied out in accordance with permit requirements.  It is anticipated that this project may be constructed during the turtle-nesting season and precautions will have to be taken.

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. All potential Offers should contact the buyer/PCO identified above for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition.  If your concerns are not satisfied by the contacting officer, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Kim McDonald, Acting Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 478-926-1922.  Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns. This acquisition will be processed in accordance with AFMC FAR Sup 5352.217-9018 (Mission Essential Quantity): If a proven source is not the low offeror, the basic quantity may be split into a First Article quantity, for award to the low unproven offeror, and a Minimum Essential Quantity, for award to the proven source, with the balance of the requirement established as options in both contracts.  Authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), "Supplies (or services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" may apply.  Numbered Note 22 applies only to the quantity identified as the mission essential quantity in the solicitation. This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application. The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation. To request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017- 3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or call DLSC at the above number. The solicitation/data package will be mailed to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time it is initially issued. Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).

<DESC>The United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) intends to acquire on the basis of Other Than Full and Open Competition two (2) Chlorine Cylinder Containment Systems and associated accessories.  This is a Notice of Intent to award a firm-fixed price contract for the above systems to TGO Technologies, Inc. 3450-C Regional Parkway, Santa Rosa, California 95403, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The containment systems are to be located at a wastewater treatment facility located near the border of the United States and Mexico. The containment systems will allow for the safe and automatic containment of chlorine from the primary chlorine cylinder located within the containment vessel while still allowing for the use of the primary chlorine cylinder for uninterrupted disinfection. The containment system will have the capability to automatically shut off the primary cylinder feed valve using a fail-safe apparatus upon detection of chlorine in the atmosphere outside of the containment system vessel. The containment system shall have no dependence upon electric power for the safe and automatic containment of primary chlorine cylinder releases located in the vessel. The Chlorine Containment System shall allow for the full use of the facilities chlorine gas building in the event of a release of chlorine from the primary chlorine cylinder, within the vessel without the need for emergency evacuation of employees, the public, or the use of a self contained breathing apparatus. The containment vessel shall have the capacity to safely, automatically, and totally contain within the vessel the contents of a one-ton cylinder of chlorine in the event of a failure of the one-ton cylinder of chlorine. The Chlorine Containment System shall allow for the safe and automatic disposal of chlorine gas from any release in the vessel into the process disinfection stream without the intervention and or exposure of facility operators, emergency response personnel or any other individual.  The chlorine containment system shall have the capability to be secured in such a way as to not allow unauthorized access to the one-ton chlorine cylinders.  There is reasonable basis to conclude that the USIBWC's minimum needs can only be satisfied by the containment system patented and provided by TGO Technologies, Inc.  The proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  There is no solicitation document available.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, any and all proposals received by 10:00 AM local time on September 3, 2002 will be considered by the Government.  Assertion of capability to provide the required system must be submitted in writing to Sherrill Brinkley, International Boundary and Water Commission, 4171 North Mesa, Building C, Suite 310, El Paso, Texas 79902-1441.  Information submitted must clearly demonstrate company capabilities to provide the required system.  No further sysnopsis will be published.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division intends to purchase the following services on a Sole Source Basis from the Institute for Advance Technology (IAT) of the University of Texas (UT) in Austin 3925 West Braker Lane, Austin, TX  78759-5316.  The purpose of the effort is to have IAT conduct studies, conduct research, and provide engineering services in support of an Electromagnetic (EM) Railgun that has the potential for development into long range, shorter time of flight, low signature, and a substantive directed lethality on target Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS) weapon which could be based on the Navys all-electric warships with improved ship capability and survivability.  The R&D studies to be undertaken by the Institute for Advanced Technology (IAT) at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin during the execution of contract are designed to address the Navys n eeds through analysis, simulation, and experiments that will validate lifetimes and scaling up to a full size Naval Railgun barrel.  The overall objective shall be to develop a reliable and experimentally validated physics and engineering basis for the design of a large-scale hypervelocity NSFS Railgun.   The estimated solicitation issue date is 21 October 2002.  The award is anticipated by 6 December 2002.   The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, 17320 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5100 has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area, therefore the synopsis/solicitation with any applicable amendments will be available on the World Wide Web at <http://www.nswc.navy.mil.supply/>.  Hard copies will not be provided.  Vendors should regularly access the NSWCDD website to ensure they have downloaded any and all amendments. IAT is currently condu cting research in this area under the Armys 6.1 Science and Technology (S&T) program for medium caliber launchers (MCL).  IAT is an independent, nonprofit organization, operates as a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) for the U.S. Army devoted to research in electrodynamics, hypersonic physics, and pulsed power.  The Army is the primary sponsor and 51% of the annual funds of the IAT are to be provided by the Army.  IAT has developed the capability over the last ten years to undertake focused research on the technologies that enable electromagnetic (EM) Railguns to successfully launch integrated launch packages to hypervelocities [2 to 3 kilometers per second (km/s)].  In all of these facilities, high-speed instrumentation and data collection techniques are employed, including flash X-Rays, B-Dot probes and high-speed cameras.  Combined with IATs other smaller Railgu n test facilities, this offers the possibility of evaluating scale effects experimentally so that the physics understanding obtained with these Railguns can be extrapolated with confidence to Navy capabilities. Interested parties other than IAT must be able to demonstrate, in writing, their capability to provide the requested services.

<DESC>The Aerospace Propulsion office of the Propulsion Directorate is paving the way for the next generation of high speed air breathing vehicles and combined cycle access to space vehicles.  To accomplish this task we are looking for industry partner(s) to research, develop and test innovative design(s) for scramjet inlets, isolators, combustors and fuel injectors i.e., engine flow path.  The work is to be performed primarily on-site at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.  The contractors are expected to work closely and interactively with government scientists and engineers and with other Propulsion Directorate contractors in executing this research and development effort. Award winners are expected to test their ideas or hardware in  the three high speed propulsion experimental facilities within the directorate.  They will be allowed to modify facility software and hardware, if necessary and upon approval of AF program manager, in order to accomplish their SOW(s).  Contractors are expected to operate and maintain these facilities as necessary in order to conduct their research and development tasks.  This includes complying with all applicable safety, environmental and hazardous material handling regulations.  The Statement of Objectives for this contract is divided into two distinct areas.  The first area requires an industry partner to address the fundamental issues associated with high-speed compressible flow phenomenon and flame holding in a scramjet.  Offerors are encouraged to use their innovative experimentation and diagnostics expertise to increase the understanding in this area.  As part of this area one will need to investigate and evaluate injection and mixing phenomenon associated with hydrocarbon fueled scramjet combustors, including novel injection schemes and novel fuel candidates.  To ensure continuous combustion, irrespective of flight conditions, active control loop sensing and actuating systems will need to be developed.  These closed loop systems should compensate for inlet start transients as well as changes in the thermal throat conditions, which can destabilize extinguish the combustion process.  The second area will require an industry partner to use state of the art experimental tools to design, develop and test fixed and/or variable inlet geometry hydrocarbon-fueled scramjet inlets, isolators and combustors over flight Mach number range from 3.5 to 8.  The long-term objectives being 1) improved performance and operability of hydrocarbon-fueled scramjets (alone and as part of a combined cycle engine) 2) the ability to repeatedly cold start a scramjet engine in flight.  We anticipate this effort to be an IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity) Type Contract. Over the next five-year period, PRA proposes to investigate several areas of interest, and bidders should consider these topics as they propose to the basic technical effort. Delivery Orders may be placed in the future for the following areas:  Area 1:  Exploration of shock / boundary-layer interactions, of particular interest will be the influence of various duct geometries on the shock/boundary-layer interactions will be investigated.  Of particular interest is the influence of various duct geometries on the shock/boundary-layer interactions and methods for controlling the interaction such as mass injection, boundary-layer energization, etc.).  Fuel injection, fuel-air mixing, and flame stabilization are areas to be studied.  Physical dimensions of scramjet engine flow-paths vary substantially for different applications.  Injection, mixing, and flame-holding schemes relevant to one may be useless for another.  Alternative scramjet ignition methods will need to be characterized numerically and experimentally for their effects on injection, mixing and combustion processes.  For example, PRA is currently investigating Plasma assisted ignition, offering potential safety and reliability benefits over current scramjet ignition methods.  Area 2:   The influence of the internal flow-path cross-section of the scramjet on limitations in engine operability and combined cycle integration need to be investigated.  The influence of corners and of the overall aspect ratio of the flow-path are two issues of interest.  The performance and operability benefits of variable geometry needs to be determined.  Further, the purpose is to be able to trade these benefits against the difficulty of incorporating movable, hot surfaces within the engine flow-path.  It may be desirable to investigate alternatives to our current baseline, JP7 fuel for high speed propulsion.  Thermal capacity trades with ignition and stability limits may favor other hydrocarbons for future applications.  Evaluate various approaches for solving the cold-start ignition problem in hydrocarbon-fueled scramjets (may include aerated fuel injection, plasma (or other) torch methods, fuel additives, etc.)  Both Research and Development areas may require further design and implementation appropriate data acquisition methods for conventional and advanced instrumentation.  Foreign sources are not permitted to respond due to ITAR/PL 98-94 requirements and  security requirements.  A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held on 02 October 2002, from 1300 hours to 1700 hours in building 18, PR Conference Room, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.  Foreign sources will not be permitted to attend the conference.

<DESC>Proposal Submission Place:  Mr. Przemyslaw Nawracala, Technical and Development Director, Zaklady Chemiczne ZACHEM, 65, ul. Wojska Polskiego, 85-825 Bydgoszcz, Poland, Ph: +48-52-361-1820, Fax: +48-52-361-0294.

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Poland: Epichlorohydrin/ Allyl Chloride Derivatives Project.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility on production of epichlorohydrin/ allyl chloride derivatives.  The feasibility study will determine: a) production of which epichlorohydrin/ allyl chloride derivatives would be most beneficial for Zachem, b) what U.S. technology to license for the production of the derivatives, such as epi-polyamines, polyamide-epichlorohydrin resins, epichlorohydrin elastomers, DADMAC (dialyllidimethylammonium chloride, and possibly others, and c) what economic and environmental advantage is offered by the production of upgraded epichlorohydrin/ ally chloride derivatives.

Zachem is one of the largest chemicals companies in the North West region of Poland. The company consists of five divisions: synthesis, epichlorohydrin, polyurethane foam, dyestuffs and plastics. Zachem manufactures some 400 semi-products and products for the chemical industry and articles for other industrial branches. The company is a well known producer of epichlorohydrin, allyl chloride, TDI (toluene di-isocyanate), polyurethane block foams, modified PCV, dyestuffs, heliophores and also hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, sodium hypochlorite and other chemicals.

Zachem is Poland's only producer of epichlorohydrin and allyl chloride, with capacity of 30,000 tons per year (t/yr). Zachem is considering a project that would build a new facility with capacity of 5,000 t/yr of epichlorohydrin / allyl chloride derivatives.

Zachem's management is interested in finding licensors of technology for production of the above-mentioned derivatives, such as epi-polyamines, polyamide-epichlorohydrin resins, epichlorohydrin elastomers, DADMAC (dialyllidimethylammonium chloride), and the others. These products are used in making paper, water treatment and for other industrial processes.

A background Definitional Mission is provided for reference in Annex 2.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $270,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).  Additionally, the Grantee will provide a $60,000 contribution towards this study through in-kind labor and materials as set forth in the TOR.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 p.m., October 31, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<SOLNBR>VARIOUS-24-Sep-2002
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Questions & Answers for Clarification of the Requirement:

1.  Question: I have a question regarding a statement in the synopsis: The actual workdays shall not exceed 25 days within the four-month period.  The statement itself is very clear, however I just wanted to be doubly sure of my interpretation.  Are we to assume the work has been estimated to take 200 man hours (25 days x 8 hrs per day), thus we should bid the solicitation accordingly utilizing these amount of hours in our bid?

The period of performance shall be for four months beginning after date of contract award, but not to exceed beyond December 31, 2002. The actual workdays shall not exceed 25 days within the four-month period.?  Does this mean the total time for the completion of the project should not exceed 25 days?

Answer: The expectation is for 200 man-hours to be delivered by the vendor over a four-month period. These hours relate to specific activities (such as installation, training, and creating a portion of the data model (a set number of input forms & reports). DOD personnel will participate actively during the project for both knowledge transfer purposes and to learn how to maintain the model and to create additional forms and reports.

2.  Question:  Is the version of MS Access 2000? 

Answer:	 No, it is MS Access 97.

3.  Question:  Since the contract could be less than 25 days, then a daily rate quote would be best? 

Answer:	 The contract can NOT be less than 25 days, it is consulting hours, training and implementation time.

4.  Question: Is the information provided in the synopsis the Statement of Work?

Answer:	Yes

5.  Question:  Can we receive the existing database schema or the data entry screens prior to us submitting our bid?  Summary information might be sufficient, for example we'd need at least to know the number of record types and data fields.

Answer:  No, currently the screens are MS Access 97 forms tied to tables.  There are approximately 16 forms involving multiple pages each.  There is a complete Data Dictionary, data elements with business rules and functionality are formally defined, but are not available to the public.  The record types and data fields will be decided during the model planning at the beginning of the project.

6.  Question: Can we also receive examples of existing reports and descriptions of the types of reports desired as a result of the work done under this solicitation?

Answer:  The types of reports desired are in the DOD MS Access model, however, they are immature and incomplete. 

7.  Question: Can you please provide me the Access database? 

Answer: No, it contains information that can not be released publicly about organizations within DOD.

8.  Question: Can the work be done at the contractor location (Michigan)? 

Answer: No, the work cannot be done at an offsite location.  The work must be accomplished at our location with training provided on site.   

9. Question:  How many tables and screens are in the scope? 

10.  Answer: Currently, the model contains approximately 52 tables, 16 input screens with multiple pages each and 24 (developed) reports with more to be developed.  

11.  Question: Is defining the new environment (SAS, Oracle, SQL Server) within the scope? 

Answer: The new environment (model) must be compatible with existing database and allow for the Office of the Chancellor, upon completion of project and implementation to maintain and change at their discretion.  

12. Question: What is  the infrastructure requirements? 

Answer:	Government furnished equipment:One stand-alone desktop computer, Pentium processor with a minimum 266 MHz, 256 MB RAM memory with Win98/NT 4.0/Win 2000.

13. Question:  Should the new application be browser based? 

Answer:  Yes

14. Question: What is the maximum hours to be expended on this project?

Answer:  Two hundred total consulting hours, to include training and implementation.
 
15. Question: Does the personnel working on this project have to be U.S. Citizen?

Answer: Yes 
 
16. Question: Do you expect the database to evolve into a data mart?

Answer: Yes, to some extent.  There is a requirement to cube the data in order to access and report.
 
17. Question: Because of lack of time do you expect us to have a proposal submitted outlining the proposed solution. If not, will the government accept the solution and buy the necessary software/hardware recommended by us if the government does not already have the software/hardware?

Answer: No, the purchase of appropriate software should be included in the proposal.  The government will buy additional hardware, if necessary, at a future date.  However, the initial application must run on a standard desktop computer.

18. Question:  What is meant by Developing on-line-analytical processing capabilities for ad hoc queries?  what-if? analyses?  

Answer:	The vendor must provide capabilities for the Office of the Chancellor to automatically create and maintain on-line-analytical processing (OLAP) cubes to provide a platform for easy, ad-hoc reporting and analysis.

19. Question: Will an Intranet or Internet application be needed to support data collection and sharing?  If so is there a domain name present or a site the Web Application can be installed on that will not pose any security problems with the IT department?  

Answer: Yes, however, the application must pass the strict requirements of our IT department.

20. Question: How many staff members will need training on the application? 

Answer: Approximately ten to support a train-the-trainer program.

(17) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial commodity items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The 21st Contracting Squadron is seeking 494 Vehicle Repeaters and all associated hardware to three different Wings to include support, installation and extended warranty. (Malmstrom Air Force Base, Minot Air Force Base, FE Warren Air Force Base.) For Minot AFB, 125 each SVR-200UA, 406-420 MHZ or equal; Malmstrom AFB, 185 each SVR-200VB, 150-174 MHZ or equal; and for FE Warren AFB, 184 each SVR-200VB, 150-174 MHZ or equal. Vehicle repeaters specifications include: (a) In-band repeating. Military radio frequencies are limited to one spectrum band per wing. The SRV-200 must have the ability to repeat within one spectrum band. Established military frequencies of 403-420MHZ and must have a 25kHz and 12.5kHz channel spacing. (b) Product size; the SRV-200 size must be small enough o fit inside the security forces vehicle atop the mounted vehicle radio, allowing the ease of installation and removal. (c) Repeater De-Key and Priority Repeater Function: The repeater must De-Key periodically to check if other repeaters are operating in the same area; if so, the repeater must be able to cease transmissions so multiple repeaters are not over repeating the radio transmission.  The SRV-200 must continue to monitor all radio transmissions even when it is not the priority repeater and take action to become the priority repeater when the absence of a priority repeater is detected.  (d) Minimum Power Output.  The SRV-200 must output less than 2 Watts. It must transfer the transmission to the mobile radio for boosting the signal power and transmission. It is critical when transmission signal strengths have been coordinated between the United States and Canada.  Minot Air Force Base Security Forces operate near the Canadian boarder and signal strengths have already been negotiated.  (e) Interface with existing radio: The SRV-200 interfaces without any modification to existing Security Forces mobile radios.  Standard cabling and wiring is used.  (f) Upward compatible with newer radio technology. The SRV-200 must use the existing radio technology to transfer the signal. It can be used with future radio upgrades without modification.

<DESC>On October 10, 2001, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) announced that it would conduct the third group of public-private competitions for its defense distribution centers. The purpose of these cost comparison studies is to obtain the most efficient and cost-effective method of providing distribution services in the management and operation of the defense distribution centers.    

Three of the seven distribution centers announced, Tobyhanna, PA (DDTP); Puget Sound, WA (DDPW); and, Corpus Christi, TX (DDCT), are being considered for 100% small business set-asides.  The NAICS code for these actions is 493110 and the small business size standard is total annual receipts of less than $21.5 million.  This would not involve a combination of the three, but a separate solicitation for each depot.  The October 10, 2001 announcement gave the number of employees as follows: Tobyhanna (120 employees), Puget Sound (86 employees), and Corpus Christi (124 employees).

Prior to setting aside these solicitations, the contracting office is seeking qualified small business sources capable of performing the operation of these depots.  To assist in the qualification process, the contracting office is asking potential offerors to access web site www.supply.dla.mil/a76/default.asp, click on the link titled ?Small Business Survey? and complete the enclosed survey.  Offerors may also review solicitations for previous studies that are still posted on the web site.  The survey should be completed no later than October 8, 2002.  The release of the first solicitation is projected for November of 2002.

<DESC>In November 2000 the Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP), Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, NM, issued four Sounding Rocket Program Follow-on (SRP-2) contracts. These contracts are seven-year Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order contracts: F04701-00-D-0206 (Space Vector Corporation); F04701-00-D-0207 (Orbital Sciences Corporation); F04701-00-D-0208 (Coleman Research Corporation); and F04701-00-D-0209 (Lockheed Martin Space Systems Co.) that provide RSLP with sounding rocket flight test services.  The purpose of this synopsis announcement is to perform market research to determine if there are additional sources of these services other than the four contractors already awarded SRP-2 contracts. In the event no additional sources are found to exist, this information may be used to support an out-of-scope ceiling increase to the SRP-2 contracts on the basis of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This increase would increase the SRP-2 contracts from the current value of $96 Million to a value of $400 Million to accommodate the increase in mission requirements. This program provides enhanced capability and flexibility in the development of RSLP sounding rocket launch vehicles and launch services with the use of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) or commercial boosters to meet a wide variety of mission requirements.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has a requirement for a Ultrasound Reading Center (USRC)  to read scans performed as part of the renewal of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study.  Small business firms having demonstrated research and development capabilities for collaboration in the coordination and implementation of designing a cardiovascular epidemiology study protocol and the capability of reading and information abstraction of ultrasound images for the study are invited to submit capabilities statements.  CARDIA is a longitudinal cohort study designed to assess the development of CVD in men and women initially aged 18-30 years in four U.S. communities.  In its year 20 examination, the study will assess measures of subclinical disease, or disease detected non-invasively before it has produced signs and symptoms.  The proposed renewal of the CARDIA has four primary objectives: a.  Identify predictors of earlier development and more rapid progression of subclinical atherosclerosis.  b.  Assess racial differences in severity and progress of early subclinical disease to elucidate possible differences in CVD pathogenesis.  c.  Test whether inflammation precedes subclinical disease.  d.  Assess the roles of genetic variation and gene by environment interactions in early development and progress of subclinical diseases.  
The CARDIA USRC will coordinate, at the direction of the Steering Committee and in collaboration with CARDIA Coordinating and four Field Centers, the development of protocols for ultrasound scans at each Field Center, and ultrasound reading and information abstraction at the Reading Center in accordance with the study design.  Coordinate, at the direction of the Steering Committee and in collaboration with the Coordinating and Field Centers, the development of scores for morphological and physiological measurements from ultrasound scanning.  These scores will be used as measures of subclinical atherosclerosis.  The scores must be appropriate to the statistical distribution features characterizing a general population, most members of whom are clinically asymptomatic.  Include suggested technical measurements and scoring procedures in the proposal.  Train, certify and monitor performance of Field Center sonographers according to the ultrasound scanning protocol.  Train and certify ultrasound readers at the Reading Center according to the reading and information abstraction protocol. Conduct a pilot test of the ultrasound protocol, including monitoring and evaluation for quality contract, during the protocol development/pilot testing phase, in collaboration with Coordinating and Field Centers.  Performance readings and information abstractions of ultrasound scans on approximately 2,966 studies, including studies from the pilot phase, the 12-month examination periods, June 1, 2005 to May 31, 2006, and rereads for quality control during the examination.  Participate in various other activities including participate in the Steering Committee, Imaging Committee, and other subcommittees as necessary, and participate in data analysis and preparation of reports and manuscripts using the ultrasound data.  Information should establish: (1) Professional qualifications, expertise, and experience of scientists and technical personnel in relevant areas including cardiac CT imaging, cardiovascular epidemiology, statistics and vascular biology.  (2) Demonstrated capacity of individuals and the institutional support to perform the functions of a cardiac CT imaging reading center for a multi-center collaborative epidemiology study, including protocol development, information processing, and coding.  (3) Availability and experience with facilities and equipment, including technical software and hardware to read cardiac CT images, and capability of transferring data between Field Centers and the Reading Center. (4) Evidence of ability to integrate potential advances in cardiac CT imaging technology into study protocol.  (5) Evidence of the ability to assess and monitor quality control for obtaining and reading cardiac CT images.  (6) Evidence of ability, software, and hardware for data management, including tracking of all Reading Center activities.  (7) The firms status as a small business under NAICS Code 541710, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences.  This is not a RFP.  No RFP is available.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to award a contract for a program entitled, "DESIGNING NEW MODELS FOR EXPLAINING FAMILY CHANGE AND VARIATION."  This sources sought announcement is presented in an effort to locate small businesses with the ability to perform the requirements of the program.  ONLY SMALL BUSINESSES SHOULD RESPOND TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. 
Based on a thorough interdisciplinary analysis and assessment of relevant research, theory, and scientific methods, NICHD seeks to develop a model (or models) for a coordinated research and data collection program reflecting an integrated approach to the study of family change and variation.   The model research and data collection program will integrate previously disparate streams within family research, including research on fertility, marriage and cohabitation, sexual behavior, and parenting, and will have the potential to significantly advance understanding of the factors and processes that drive family change at both the individual and societal levels. The model(s) may have several components which together comprise a coordinated program of research capable of testing specific, theoretically driven hypotheses while also serving as a resource for researchers addressing a broad set of policy-relevant and scientific questions. The model(s) should have the ability to expand and contract to respond to varying funding levels, and they should complement existing data and research resources related to family and fertility.  
The model research and data collection program will be developed under the direction of a Principal Investigator who is a noted expert in family, fertility and research design, in conjunction with a core working group of 6 to 8 members. The working group will devise and implement strategies to seek input from population and other scholars in performing reviews of research and theory, conducting original methodological and theory-development research, and shaping and refining the design for the model research and data collection program.   The working group will develop a theory or set of theories to explain family change that integrate and build upon major approaches in different disciplines. The planning process and supporting research will be designed to consider theories from a wide variety of disciplines (e.g., anthropology, biology, demography, economics, family studies, policy, psychology, and sociology).  It will also consider methodologies drawn from a diverse set of disciplines and assess the potential of a variety of innovative research and data collection strategies. The working group will articulate the compatibilities and contradictions across theories and formalize the theories to be tested and the research and data collection design for testing them. The working group will conduct original research, such as-meta-analytic research, qualitative studies, secondary data analyses, and methodological studies, as appropriate to review and integrate theory, review current scientific knowledge, conduct preliminary studies in un-researched areas, evaluate potential methodologies, design alternative models, evaluate models, and prioritize the models and/or component parts.  The working group will make substantial use of consultants, commissioned papers, working groups, committees and sub-committees, and workshops, as appropriate, to ensure that the model program reflects relevant expertise from the broadest possible set of disciplines and research areas.
AT THIS TIME, ONLY CAPABILITY STATEMENTS ARE BEING REQUESTED FROM SMALL BUSINESSES.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  The required service is defined as code 541990 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  For the purposes of this announcement, a small business is defined as one that has revenues of <$5 MILLION.  Small businesses that believe that they have the ability to satisfy all of the above stated capabilities, and who meet the stated size standards, are encouraged to submit a capability statement to the address indicated above within 45 days of the publication of this announcement.  The capability statement should be limited to no more than fifteen (15) pages and it should address each of the competencies indicated above.  If responses indicate the likelihood of satisfactory competition among qualified small businesses, the anticipated solicitation will be restricted to small businesses only.  The contract is anticipated to have duration of three years.  The reference number to be used for this announcement is: SS-HD-2003-03.   Interested organizations should submit a letter of interest and a capability statement via E-mail (nichdcmb@mail.nih.gov), FAX or postal mail, within 45 days of the date of this publication to Ms. Virginia A. DeSeau at the addresses listed above.  All correspondence must cite the reference number as provided above.  All sources that consider themselves qualified are encouraged to respond.

<SUBJECT>D -- NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE:
REPLACES PREVIOUS NOTICE POSTED 09/21/02 TO CHANGE THE CLASSIFICATION FROM 70 GENERAL PURPOSE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT TO 99 MISC = D INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES

The U.S. Customs Service intends to negoitiate and award as sole source to Toss Inc., 10201 Lee Highway, Suite 570, Fairfax, VA., 22033.  

The award will be based upon the procedures as described in FAR 6.3 Other Than Full and Open Competition.  The procedures of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition awards over $25,000.00 but not more than $100,000.00.  The award will be processed under the authority of 10 USCS 23 ?(1), ?only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. ? 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. 
However, all proposals received by the closing date and 5:00 PM central standard time will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Toss Inc is the only known source who can provide the U.S. Customs Service Logistics Division National Printing Officer software with the capability to manage, track, analyze, perform quality assurance, and in many instances project program productivity, workload, costs and potential revenue.  These tasks must be accomplished in concert with the existing federal printing system (including forms, procurement methods and award data furnished by the Government Printing Office).  This determination was made by the U.S. Customs Service Office of Information and Technology Lan Engineering Team and Technical Review Committee.  It was determined that the Production Tracker offered by Toss Inc., is the only printing management tool available on the market that is capable of providing the required service and is designed to work effectively inside a secure government information technology environment such as the U.S. Customs Service.

<SUBJECT>B--Laboratory Analysis, Pesticides, AR 2232, for Meat and Poultry Industry
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Water seeks to procure, on an other than full and open competition, analytical support services for a single sampling episode for the Meat and Poultry  Products Industry from a single source.  The single source is  Pacific Analytical, Inc. (PAI), 6056 Corte del Cedro, Carlsbad, CA 92009.  PAI  is  the only  laboratory  currently with the demonstrated capability and experience in analyzing samples by the required  methods (and associated method modifications that are specified in the SOW) and reporting data electronically in accordance with the EPA-specified  format. EPA requires analysis of approximately 13 industrial wastewater samples, 2 matrix spikes, and 2 matrix spike duplicates  for pesticides/herbicides  by various EPA methods to include 632 and 1660.   EPA will use the analytical data provided under this purchase order to develop industrial effluent discharge regulations that govern the disposal of pollutants  from Meat and Poultry  Products Industry sources;  therefore, data produced under this purchase order must be of highest possible quality.  Laboratories will be required to employ a comprehensive quality assurance program, meet facilities and equipment requirements, and provide  personnel that demonstrate technical expertise in analytical chemistry techniques. The sampling episode for the Meat and Poultry Products  Industry, Episode 6485, is scheduled to be collected during the week of  October 28, 2002.

It is anticipated that samples will arrive at the laboratory each day from Tuesday,  October 29, 2002 through Saturday,  November 2, 2002.  The laboratory is required to meet a 30 day data turnaround from receipt of the last sample associated with Episode 6485 at the laboratory, unless dilutions and/or reanalyses are required.  If dilutions and/or reanalyses are required, the data turnaround time for the entire data package will remain at 30 days.  The laboratory must adhere to extraction and analytical holding times as stated in the methods.  PAI  has a minimum of  five years of  experience analyzing for  pesticides/herbicides parameters using the required EPA methods, and has Method Detection Limit (MDL) and Initial Precision and Recovery (IPR) data on-file at EPA.  Start-up tests requiring significant time and effort would be required from other labs.  Analytical conditions of the instrument must be adjusted so that undistorted spectra are produced.  Further, other laboratories would need to invest significant time and effort in developing the necessary data delivery software to submit data electronically in the format required by EPA.  The process of new laboratory start up would also involve a significant expenditure of EPA resources (at least 80 hours) to bring the laboratories up to speed.  This expenditure is not justified by a one-time purchase order for these services and this cost to EPA would more than counter any potential analysis cost savings that another laboratory could offer.  In addition, EPA requires these services within four weeks' time.  This time would be insufficient to bring any other laboratories "up to speed" and ensure that EPA would receive the high quality data needed to support effluent guidelines regulatory development for the Metal and Poultry Products  Industry.  This procurement is being conducted   under the simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and other than full and open competition in accordance with (41 U.S.C.  253 (c) (1)) and FAR 6.302-1 . This notice of intent is not a request  for competitive proposals.   Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting documentation to Linda Merryman  at the office identified above, by fax (513)487-2115 or by e-mail (merryman.linda@epa.gov) which establishes that their technical qualifications meet the  EPA's requirement.  Anticipated award date is October 4, 2002,  therefore documentation must be received   September 26, 2002.  A determination by the EPA not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  See note 22.

<SUBJECT>--MARKET RESEARCH FOR EEO COMPLIANCE CONSULTING FIRMS
<DESC>NA The John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) will be conducting market research and information exchange interviews with companies providing Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) compliance consulting services in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.201, entitled Exchanges With Industry Before Receipt of Proposals.  The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Governments requirements, and enhancing the Governments ability to obtain quality services, at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.  The Volpe  Center will be conducting this market research through one-on-one meetings with potential offerors.  Due to time and space requirements, these one-on-one meetings will be held with the first 20 (twenty) companies who request an interview. The District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT) has asked the Volpe Center to develop a program and reporting system for EEO requirements both internally, for the department employees, and externally, for all DDOT consultants and sub consultants.  We are looking for firms who are capable of : making an initial assessment of the current state of DDOTs compliance policies and procedures; identifying what components of DDOTs EEO reporting requirements are insufficient or lacking and what DDOT needs to accomplish in order to fully comply with  EEO reporting requirements; developing standard operating procedures complete with roles and responsibilities, timelines for internal DDOT deliverables, a how to guide, and standardized electronic forms; creating an electronic template for annual EEO reporting based on the Arkansas model ( or similar best practice model); producing the first joint submission of an internal and external EEO report to the DC Division office of FHWA and,  conducting an orientation session on the standard operating procedures and the electronic template for the current and newly hired DDOT staff that will be working in the Procurement and Civil Rights Office  The contractor will be required to know and incorporate both federal and District EEO regulations, identify the elements of those regulations and put the  missing items in place to ensure that the end product is complete and adheres to all EEO regulations.  The contractor may also need the support of an editor who is skilled in developing easy to use electronic templates, in a form that does not require additional software purchase (e.g., Microsoft Word) and can be added to over the course of time.  The interviews will take place at the District Department of Transportation, Reeve Center, 2000 14th Street, N.W., Washington, DC in the 5th floor conference room on October 1st and 2nd, 2002.  The interviews will be for one hour each.  Due to space limitations, not more than three representatives from each company will be interviewed.

<DESC>The Commanding Officer, Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, announced today its tentative decision to retain in-house the Base Operating Services for Marine Corps Base Quantico.  This decision is the result of a competitive process conducted in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76. There were approximately 552 military and civilian personnel performing the functions under study. The decision to retain the performance of the functions in-house was made after a detailed study indicated it was more cost effective to continue to perform the functions by reorganizing Governmental personnel rather than by contract. As a result of the effeciencies identified in the study, it is expected that a number of these positions will be eliminated. A 30 day appeal period commences on the date of announcement, Tuesday September 24, 2002 and will continue through close of business Wednesday October 23, 2002. Appeals of the decision should be mailed or delivered to the Commanding Officer, Engineering Field Activity Chesapeake, 1314 Harwood Street, SE, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC 20374-5018, Attention: Danny Stubbs. Resolution of any appeals will occur within 30 days following conclusion of the appeals period.

<SUBJECT>M--OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE SUPPORT FOR THE PLUM ISLAND ANIMAL DISEASE CENTER, PLUM ISLAND, NY
<DESC>The USDA, ARS, Contracts Branch intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with LB&B Associates, a one month extension of the performance period of Contract 53-3K06-6-1000 from October 1-31, 2002.  The contractor shall furnish on-site operations and maintenance support services for the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC) located in Plum Island, New York.  Services include but are not limited to:  heating, air conditioning, waste water treatment, incinerator service, power plant services, vessel, electrical, vehicle, and equipment services to support the scientific research mission of the PIADC.  During the extension period, phase-in will begin for the resultant contract.  Based on LB&B's comprehensive knowledge of the PIADC research mission, the complex systems which support the bio-contained laboratory, its evolving integrated support service requirements, familiarity with the Union, and its broad technical expertise, LB&B is in a unique position to provide the PIADC operations and maintenance services for an extended period (October 1-31, 2002).  LB&B is the only known source that possesses both the intimate knowledge of the facility and the Union required to ensure continuity of services at PIADC for this period.  Due to biosecurity and biosafety concerns and current economic strike by the Union employees, entering into a new contract for the period of this extension would be detrimental to the research mission.  This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  The contracting action will be other than full and open competition under the Authority 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), Justification: Supplies or Services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources and not other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6 of the FAR, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number for this procurement is N00189-02-T-1369.  The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR 13.5 under the authority of the Clinger-Cohen test program for commercial items. North American Industry Classification System code is 3399; the small business size standard is 500 employees.    


This is a sole source acquisition set aside 100% for small business (Note 22 Sole Source Acquisition Applies).  FISC Habitability Division Norfolk intends to purchase the following main boiler inspection device (bid scope) for the U.S. Navy:  

CLIN 0001 Lenox Instrument Company, NSN 6650-01-469-1631 Part #:  6535-Kit-M (Main Boilers).  The borescope has five major assemblies that include:  eyepiece section, objective section, extender section, viewing head, and power cable.  The borescope is an optical instrument used for the internal visual inspection of inaccessible areas.  Lenox borescopes are long tubular instruments, which differ optically from telescopes in that they spread or expand the view thus permitting a more rapid inspection.  Borescopes contain objective lenses with varying fields of view (usually 60 degrees, but fields up to 180 degrees are available), forming an image of the object within the ?cone of view? of the area under observation.  The image is transmitted through the tube by achromatic relay lenses to the ocular end where it is magnified by an adjustable eyepiece. Borescopes may be made in one piece or may be sectioned in convenient increments for handling and storage.  At the eyepiece end of the instrument, a short distance beyond the focusing eyepiece, is the handle, which allows the operator to control the direction of view.  This handle also contains the power cord connector, a switch and two (2) fuse holders.  The right angle eyepiece slides in or out, in order to focus the instrument on a specific area.  It may also be rotated through 360 degrees to satisfy any operator?s preference for viewing position.  The right angle eyepiece is equipped with a diopter focus that should be rotated to bring the outer circle of the aperture into sharp focus before focusing on a specific area in the boiler.  Quantity:  2 each.


Delivery shall be FOB Destination.  Delivery shall be to:  SIMA Norfolk, Attn:  Adam Kinder, 9170 Second St., STE 100, Norfolk, VA 23511-2932. Delivery date of 120 days after date of contract is required.  Award of a firm fixed price contract on a sole source basis is designated.

<DESC>Opportunity for Cooperative Research and Development Agreement(s) (CRADAs) For Evaluation of Low Wind Speed Technologies

Summary:  The National Renewable Energy Laboratory seeks CRADA partners to collaborate on the evaluation of innovative new technologies in the area of Low Wind Speed Technology.  The DOE?s goal is production of electrical energy for 3 ?/kWh at low wind speed sites by 2010.  Low wind speed sites are defined as sites with an average annual wind speed of 5.8 m/s at 10 m above ground level.  Technologies to be evaluated under these CRADAs should have as their objective the overcoming of a barrier or impediment to using wind energy at such low wind speed sites.  Technologies should address reduction of cost of energy, improving performance, and increasing reliability and functionality for wind turbines.   In order to be considered for support, technologies should meet the following three criteria:  1) Innovation ? the ability to solve a problem or overcome a barrier; 2) Relevance to development and deployment of low wind speed technology; 3) The problem or issue to be explored under the CRADA should allow for the rapid evaluation of the innovation within the time frame and support levels envisioned for the CRADA.  At this time, the DOE has chosen to limit these explorations to horizontal axis wind turbine architectures.  Technologies may focus on any aspect of wind turbine design and systems integration, including: aerodynamics, power conversion, structures, transmission and energy storage.

Dates:  Confidential CRADA proposal summaries, preferably one page or less must be submitted to Mr. Neil Wikstrom by December 1, 2002, to take full advantage of this opportunity to leverage DOE resources.  CRADA proposal summaries submitted thereafter may be considered if a suitable CRADA Collaborator is not selected from among the timely responses.  Final negotiations of CRADA agreements and terms and conditions will be completed after initial discussions have concluded.

Supplementary Information:  Selection of an offering of collaboration will be solely at the discretion of laboratory management, based on interest in the technology, and laboratory assessment of the likelihood that the proposed collaboration will result in commercialization of improved wind technology and increased utilizations and deployment of wind energy.  Laboratory support will focus on engineering assessments, running of analytical codes, and conducting laboratory or field tests.  NREL is owned by the U.S. DOE and all expenditure of all funds are subject to the approval of the DOE. 

The actual amount of NREL support for an individual CRADA will be determined and agreed upon at the time of technical discussion.  The amount of NREL support that may be anticipated for any individual CRADA is expected to be a fraction of a researcher year.  The total level of NREL support for all CRADA activities will be based upon available program funds allocated each fiscal year.  A CRADA is an agreement designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government entities.  It is not a grant, and is not a contract for procurement of goods/services.  The CRADA will result in no transfer of funds from the laboratory to the Collaborator.  Under the CRADA, NREL can contribute use of facilities, staff, materials, and expertise.  The CRADA Collaborator will have an option to negotiate the terms of an exclusive or nonexclusive commercialization license to subject inventions arising under the CRADA.  The expected duration of the CRADA is not more than less than one year.

CRADA Evaluation Criteria:  The following criteria shall be used by NREL in evaluating all submissions.
1.  The level to which the proposed project contributes to DOE technical goals and objectives as they relate to Low Wind Speed Technology (205%).
2.  The likelihood of achieving the technical goals of the specific project within the proposed time frame (205%).
3.  The likelihood of completing the project within the proposed budget (205%).
4.  4.  The level to which the project meets program goals of competitiveness, diversity of technology and diversity of participants in the Wind Energy Program (205%).
5.  Ability of CRADA partner to commercialize potential inventions of the CRADA for U.S. economic benefit (20%).


Addresses:  Proposal submissions should be sent to:
