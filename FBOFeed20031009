<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service intends to award a time and materials, sole source contract to the Cardiovascular Research Foundation for expanding the content and infrastructure of the HeartHealthyWomen.org Website. This action is a follow-on procurement to contracts previously performed in part by the Cardiovascular Research Foundation. This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services Office on Women?s Health, Washington, DC.  The HeartHealthyWomen website provides comprehensive gender-based information on cardiovascular disease in women.  During the pilot phase (Phase I) of the project, the website infrastructure was built and educational content on coronary artery disease (CAD) was developed.  This procurement will fund Phase II of the project.  The purpose of this phase II proposal is to develop and add content on congestive heart failure (CHF) for both the patient and healthcare provider sections of the website, continue developing and adding content on CAD for both the patient and healthcare provider sections of the website, and further provide the infrastructure upon which to build additional modules or phases for expanded content and presentation format. Negotiations are anticipated with the Cardiovascular Research Foundation.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. The Cardiovascular Research Foundation is uniquely qualified as it is a non-profit organization with internationally recognized clinical expertise in interventional catheter-based therapeutics that bridges the fields of research, education, and clinical practice.  There is no other organization in the United States with the wealth of data and research on the treatment of women with heart disease that can provide the required credibility and scientific rigor for the web site diagnosis and treatment information.  Interested parties may identify their interest in and capabilities for the requirement by forwarding their information to the point of contact identified below. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all information on capabilities received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Point of Contact for this action is Melissa McPherson.  Questions or submissions of interest and capabilities MUST be emailed to melissa.mcpherson@mms.gov .  Faxes or Telephonic requests will not be accepted or acknowledged.

<DESC>NASA/SSC plans to issue a Best Value Request for Offer (RFO) to install a new roof on Building 3202.  The work is summarized as follows: Remove and dispose of the existing roof gravel on Sections of	 Building 3202 indicated on drawing.  (52,100 square feet) Remove and install a certified lightning protection system.	 Remove existing flashing, cants, and nailers and replace with new, as directed. Install a new modified bitumen roof system which will consist of one base ply, one ply of insulation recovery board, plus two additional mopped plys of asphalt impregnated fiberglass felts coated with SBS modified bitumen. Repair or replace existing gutters and downspouts if indicated.	Best Value Selection (BVS) seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit (including past performance, and relevant experience) of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the Offerors and the Government. BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the Offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts). However, the Government will consider awarding to an Offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value. Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an Offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other offers warrant doing so.  The order of magnitude for this procurement is $100,000 to $250,000, and the effort shall be completed within 60 (sixty) calendar days after receipt of the notice to proceed.  This procurement is unrestricted. The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement are 238160 and $12 million, respectively. This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. As a result, all qualified sources may submit a bid, which shall be considered by the agency.  The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about October 24 2003, with an anticipated bid closing date of on or about November 25, 2003.  The firm date for receipt of bids or offers will be stated in the RFO.  A pre-proposal conference and site visit have been tentatively scheduled for November 5, 2003 at 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. at the South Gate Reception Center, Room 109. Offerors are requested to arrive 30 minutes early in order to receive a badge for on site access to Stennis Space Center.   Oral questions will not be accepted; but written questions will be accepted at the conclusion of the site visit. Official written answers to questions will be posted as an amendment. Offerors are encouraged to submit questions prior to the pre-proposal conference.  The Cut-off date for questions in response to the solicitation and the site visit for this project is November 10, 2003.	The clauses at 52.236-2, Differing Site Conditions, and 52.236-3, Site Investigations and Conditions Affecting the Work, will be included in any contract awarded as a result of this solicitation. Accordingly, offerors or quoters are expected to inspect the site where the work will be performed.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to attend the site visit conference to inspect the site to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable. In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.  An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".  Specifications and Drawings will only be made available on CDROM. Requests for copies shall be made by email to the Bid Distribution Office: Jason.F.Edge@nasa.gov or you may fax your request to (228) 688-1141.

<DESC>This synopsis describes an upcoming solicitation that the FDA plans to issue.  A firm fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract with a base year plus two option years is planned.

The purpose of the contract resulting from the solicitation will be to assist the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Office of Drug Safety (ODS) in expanding its access to medical error data resources, to complement our current adverse event databases.
 

This data will be used by FDA staff to better assess a medical error event, both in quantitative and qualitative terms.  This effort is a response to the ongoing initiatives identified in the Quality Interagency Coordination Task Force Report (QuIC response to the IOM report) dated February 2000.  The QuIC report, in part, charged FDA with the tasks of developing standards associated with proprietary drug name confusion, labeling and packaging to prevent dosing and drug mix-ups and medication errors; and, to strengthen FDA’s overall analytical capabilities.  To assist in performing these initiatives, ODS is interested in acquiring direct access to one centralized data system integrating multiple information systems from either US hospitals, health maintenance organizations, long-term care facilities, home care, or other components of health care systems representing potential and actual medical errors.  For the purpose of this requirement, medical errors include, but are not limited to, medication errors, laboratory errors, surgical errors, and/or device errors. 

The FDA intends to use Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) data in addition to these data to strengthen our internal safety analysis on medical errors.  This analysis may lead to a regulatory action with a pharmaceutical or device company.  The ability of FDA to respond expeditiously to the increasing number of critical issues associated with medical errors is of paramount importance to the overall public safety.  The addition of these data would complement and strengthen the utility of the voluntary and mandatory reporting systems currently in place. Access to these data will increase FDA’s capability to perform regulatory impact studies to better understand and improve standards for medical product naming, labeling, packaging, and design.

Program Research Goals: 

Provide direct access to a medical error data resource with the capability of providing root cause and trend analysis.
Provide FDA personnel with unlimited, Internet access to these data in a multi-user environment and in real-time.
Provide FDA personnel with the ability to retrieve reports that are driven by certain selection parameters (e.g. health system setting, product name, product specific information [strength, dosage form, etc.] date of error, type and cause of the error, and patient outcome). 
Provide FDA personnel with the ability to query and obtain aggregate reports for the purpose of conducting medical error evaluations.  
Provide FDA personnel with the ability to broadcast global safety messages to the health system users of the medical error database for the purpose of seeking reports for certain adverse events that have been previously identified by FDA (item is desirable but not required).

To assist FDA in achieving these objectives, a two-month, no cost trial subscription to the full, commercially available data resource shall be required.

The anticipated release date of the solicitation is October 17, 2003.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), National Institutes of Health, has a requirement to develop, maintain, and distribute animals from a standing colony of aged mutant mice for use by investigators in studies of aging.  The word ‘mutant’ refers to transgenic, knockout and spontaneously arising mutant genotypes.

During the nine-year period of performance of this cost reimbursement contract, the expected colony population will range from 1,000 in the first year, to a peak of 12,000 in years 3 through 7, then declining to near 0 by the ninth year.  This colony shall be divided into two approximately equal and separate segments maintained behind independent barriers, pathogen and parasite free, for the total nine year period.   The Offeror should have facilities suitable for development and maintenance of the mice strains required for this project, along with experience in breeding, rearing, maintaining and distributing animal colonies of similar magnitude and having similar health, genetic, and environmental requirements.  The Offeror should also have an awareness of problems and complications likely to be observed in the conduct of this project and methods to address them, particularly, the knowledge of the importance of maintenance of the high standard of health and genetic purity.  THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  It will be available on this website, as well as at the following website: http://ocm.od.nih.gov/drc/rfp.htm   on or about 15 calendar days from the date of the publication of this synopsis.  OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINELY CHECKING THIS WEBSITE FOR ANY POSSIBLE SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  NO INDIVIDUAL NOTIFICATION OF ANY AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<CONTACT>Susan.L.Cunningham, 256-895-1137
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, Alabama has a requirement for Operation and Maintenance (O&M) services at Government medical (with limited non-medical) facilities in the continental United States (Zone 1), Alaska, and Hawaii (Zone  2), as well as overseas locations (Zone 3) to include Guam, Portugal, Turkey, Spain, Japan, Germany, England, Korea, and Italy.  The potential contracts will identify locations to be covered under the contracts by zones.  Zone 1 is CONUS, Zone 2 is Alaska  and Hawaii, and Zone 3 is OCONUS.  Small businesses are not required to propose on Zone 2 or Zone 3, but may propose on all zones if they so desire.  Offerors submitting a proposal for unrestricted awards must propose on all zones.  These O&M services wil l consist of those actions required to preserve and maintain government medical and non-medical real property facilities in such a condition that they may be effectively used for their designated functional purpose. Although this acquisition applies to med ical and non-medical facilities, the primary focus of this acquisition and proposal evaluations will be medical facilities. OCONUS medical and non medical facilities will be limited to less than 15% of the programmatic capacity. These services will include  scheduled maintenance, unscheduled maintenance, repair/replacement/renovation of facility systems and equipment, hospital aseptic services, grounds maintenance, pest management, medical equipment maintenance/repair, equipment inventories, condition assess ments, identification and or validation of problems/deficiencies, preparation of work plans describing method of correction/repair, actual execution of work plan to repair failed or failing medical and non-medical facility systems and equipment, implementa tion of automated maintenance management and CADD systems, facility management support, project management, minor construction within and without facilities, and other activities associated with operation, maintenance, and repair.  Facility systems will in clude all mechanical, electrical, architectural, utility, and site systems, equipment and components. These O&M services will include, but are not limited to hospitals, clinics, administrative, pharmacies, veterinarian, dental, training, research, plants, labs, and storage facilities as well as some non-medical facilities associated with these medical facilities.  Government medical facility maintenance/repair/renovation shall conform to the requirements of the Joint Commission of Accreditation of Health Ca re Organizations (JCAHO) Environment of Care Standards and other applicable codes and standards.  Fulfilling individual requirements for supplies and services will be achieved under the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 16.505(b) (Ordering ), by the implementation of task orders issued under the proposed contracts.   The proposed contract type is an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ), using firm fixed price (FFP) and time and material (T&M) task orders.  A single solicitation is  proposed for award of multiple contracts.  It is anticipated that five ID/IQ contracts will be awarded in an estimated amount of $375 million dollars.   The place of contract performance is the continental United States (Zone 1), Alaska, and Hawaii (Zone 2), as well as overseas locations (Zone 3) to include Guam, Portugal, Turkey, Spain, Japan, Germany, England, Korea, and Italy.   It is anticipated that three contracts will be unrestricted, and two will be set-aside for small businesses. The total value of all three unrestricted contracts will be approximately $225 million over the base year and four option years (3 contracts x 5 ye ars), and that the total value of both restricted small business contracts will be approximately $150 million over the base year and four option years (2 contracts x 5 years). Option years are not required to be exercised.  A unilateral modification will b e utilized to increase or de crease capacities on each of the resultant contracts (not to exceed the programmatic capacity of $375M), to accommodate program variables, contractor performance, and the requirements of Section 803 of Public Law 107-107 as necessary.  Teaming arrangements  and joint ventures between offerors are encouraged, if required, to provide the full depth and breadth of experience and capability required under this solicitation and resulting contracts.  Fair Opportunity requirements under Section 803 of Public Law 10 7-107 and implementing DFARS guidance will be utilized with award of task orders under the resulting contracts. The most applicable North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561210, paragraph b, Facilities Support Services, with a sma ll business size standard of $23M, exception 13.  The agency will apply FAR 52.219-14 on assessing whether a small business concern is eligible under a small business set aside. Offerors responding to this announcement shall reference DACA87-03-R-0009.  Th e solicitation will be released electronically through the Internet at http:www.hnd.usace.army.mil/EBS/AdvertisedSolicitations.asp on or about June 16, 2003 and will close 22 July 2003.

In accordance with DFARS 252-204.7004, Required Central Contactor Registration, offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) databa se.

<DESC>APPROXIMATE ISSUE DATE: August 1, 2003 
Contractor shall provide all labor, material and equipment to repair and install roll up door covers over the rail location and to improve sealing the area off from weather, all work shall take place at building 2211,2212 and 2213 at Hill AFB Utah.
Repair the concrete dock & steel reinforcement as required, repair the rail mating pieces, and grout the rail at buildings 2211, 2212, and 2213. Replace the damaged concrete and angle iron edge, remove the rails, reach or and shim the rails, replace the damaged rail mating sections, regrout with 5 star non-shrink grout, regrind bottom of the rails and realign the rails to the MM Rail tolerances.  The following procedures will be followed. Remove all concrete grout, bolts and shims from under the rails on the docks of each building.  Each building has four bays with two rails each. The supports in question are approximately 6 ft long by 12 inches wide and 6 inches in height.  Shims will be replaced or reused and bolts replaced with new. Bolts must fasten to the existing dock slab. High strength concrete grout will be used to set the rails in place. Rails must be installed within the required vertical and horizontal tolerances.  It is expected that repairs are possible without removal. The rails extend from the docks into the building and would be very difficult to remove. In addition to the rail supports, several areas on the dock and dock support beams need surface repairs & verification of steel reinforcement and integrity of structure. All area of delaminated concrete shall be sandblasted to remove loose concrete. High strength Shot Crete or equal material will be applied to patch any vertical areas needing repair. Use a high strength concrete to repair dock surfaces. Any edge angel that is excessively warped or damaged will be removed and replaced. Place of contract performance: Hill AFB, UT.

<DESC>Requirement is to provide on-call Radiology “interpretative services” coverage seven (7) days per week during the hours of 1700 (5:00 pm) to 0700 (7:00 am) for the Radiology Department, Keesler Medical Center, Keesler AFB, MS. The contracting entity must be JCAHO-accredited and shall ensure that all services provided by the contracted licensed independent provider (LIP) are within the scope of the provider’s privileges.  The LIP will not be directing patient care – providing interpretative services only.  Therefore, as outlined in AFI 44-119, paragraph 5.32, the LIP will not need to be credentialed by the MTF. The on-call provider shall provide their own pager and must be able to respond for emergency support within 1 hour of receiving the study electronically. The contract provider shall provide preliminary interpretation of radiological examinations performed by Government personnel and provide further diagnostic consultation that relates to diagnostic imaging, upon request, to other members of the medical staff.  Individual patient “examinations” may consist of one or more of the following digital images: Cross sectional Imaging: Computed Tomography (CT) – approximately 85 per month; Ultrasound Images – approximately. 20 per month; Nuclear Medicine – approximately 5 per month; and  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) – approximately 2 per month. The contractor shall provide, install, and maintain all hardware and software required to create a persistent IP-to-IP connection between the contractor’s interpreting facility and Keesler Medical Center. The contractor is responsible for coordinating all connectivity requirements with the base firewall and necessary networked devices. 
 
Period of performance will be from date of award to 30 Sep 2004.  The Government contemplates award of a firm-fixed price contract to the offeror whose offer is determined to be the best value to the Government based on ability to respond within required parameters and assure requisite connectivity with the Centricity Radiology Web Server, price and past performance.  For the purpose of this determination, the ability to provide an acceptable, credentialed provider within the one-hour time frame and to comply with technical and computer security requirements are considered to be more important than price and past performance combined.  This acquisition is UNRESTRICTED.  The NAICS code is 621512 and the small business standard is 11.5 million.  All responsible business sources may submit quotation, which will be considered.  Solicitation number FA3010-04-T-0002 will be issued electronically on 14 Oct 03 and may be accessed and downloaded at: www.eps.gov .

<DESC>Fleet and Industrial Supply Center {Norfolk} Detachment
Philadelphia intends to acquire through full and open competition 
technical, analytical, consulting, engineering, logistics, and related services to support the operation of the U.S. Navy Price Fighter Program under the sponsorship of the Navy Inventory Control Point/Code 078 (nee Fitting Out and Supply Support/FOSSAC). Among the work products to be provided are intrinsic value and should cost analyses on Government procured spare parts, repairables, and weapons systems for DOD and other 
Government activities. This program effort will be attained by a new contract instrument. The estimated amount of services covers the minimum needs of the Government for the specified period. The solicitation (N00140-04-R-0107) will be available on or after   29 October 2003. The program effort shall consist of a Basic Program Term/LOT I of 12 months encompassing 17 May 2004 through 16 May 2005 plus four (4) successive option terms consisting of twelve (12) months each term. If all options to extend the term of the contract are exercised, contract ordering period will continue through 16 May 2009. The assessed cumulative level of effort consists of 1,578,143 productive man-hours of effort for the entire acquisition program (if all options are exercised). The estimated total level of productive effort identified with the Basic Program Term/LOT I is 253,600 man-hours of direct labor. The solicitation will contain the applicable statement of work, specifications, and staffing prerequisites. The solicitation will require the submission of technical and cost 
proposals and the Government will conduct a best value analysis. The technical proposal factors are past performance, personnel resources, technical approach, corporate past experience, and extent of participation of small and small disadvantaged business firms, women-owned small businesses, and historically black colleges or universities and minority institutions in performance of the contract. Respondents will submit specified key personnel resumes as identified in the solicitation. The evaluation of proposals will consider the offeror's technical proposal 
more important than the offeror's cost proposal. Costs will be assessed on the basis of cost realism. The Government intends to issue the award to the eligible, responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to represent the best value to the Government after evaluation in accordance with the factors in the solicitation. The Government contemplates award of a cost-plus-fixed-fee indefinite delivery-
requirements/firm fixed price hybrid instrument with task orders to be placed under the contract for specific delivery of services. Any task order placed under the resultant contract may be subject to incremental funding provisions. It is projected that the firm fixed price contract line items, which consist of four (4) analytical work products, comprise a combined   estimated quantity of 2,000 each during each program year. Interested sources are advised that the acquisition may be subject to organizational conflict of interest provisions. If the offeror's proposal is determined unacceptable in any of the technical evaluation factors and/or subfactors, the proposal may not be considered for award. The Government reserves the 
right to award the contract to other than the lowest priced offeror. All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (Norfolk) Detachment Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Avenue, Bldg. 2B, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5083. All responses should be directed to the attention of FISC NORVA DETPHILA Code 02P1A. The Government will not pay for information received. E-mail account is

<DESC>The Biomedical Imaging Program (BIP), Division of Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI) is reissuing this RFP to develop contracts to support Phase 1(Safety) and Phase 2(Preliminary Clinical Efficacy) clinical trials of promising imaging agents. These clinical trials will be used to rapidly evaluate the safety and diagnostic imaging capabilities of promising imaging probes, ligands, radiopharmaceuticals, and contrast agents that are of interest to NCI.  The Safety and Preliminary Clinical Efficacy Imaging Clinical Trials contracts will create an infrastructure poised to rapidly evaluate molecularly-targeted imaging agents used to assess therapeutic anticancer agents on their molecular targets and determine clinically relevant correlates.  The objectives of this program are:  to rapidly conduct clinical trials necessary to assess the safety of  promising  imaging agents;  to rapidly conduct clinical trials necessary to assess the diagnostic imaging capabilities and preliminary efficacy of  promising imaging agent to characterize the molecular interactions of new molecular imaging agents with  their targets through biopsies, assays, and other appropriate technologies and correlate those effects with clinically-relevant endpoints;  to develop new scientific insights into molecular pathways and determinants of  the relationship of the targeted imaging agents to therapeutic drug response.  Major emphasis shall be on imaging agents which are found to be safe and provide important structural, metabolic, or molecular imaging data which will be important and useful in the management of patients with cancer. These Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials will obtain the necessary data to fulfill the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria to eventually become an approved and potentially marketable imaging  agent for specific imaging indications. The studies will explore promising imaging agents, and require rapid initiation, completion, and data reporting.  These contracts will also require the ability to implement correlative studies validating the localization of the investigational imaging agents on their molecular target in tumors.  Imaging agents may originate from investigators not affiliated with clinical sites. The Government anticipates that three (3) contracts will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for four years.  The size of each trial might vary depending on consultation with the FDA for each specific agent.  The typical size for each Safety trail will be approximately 10 patients.    The typical size for each Preliminary Clinical Efficacy trail is estimated to be 25 patients.  NAICS Code No. 621512 with a size standard of $11.5.Million.   The solicitation is scheduled for electronic release approximately December 18, 2002.  The RFP may be accessed through internet address http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/.  It is the offeror?s responsibility to monitor the above internet site for the release of this solicitation and amendments, if any.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is seeking Offerors who have the capability to test approximately fifty (50) chemicals per year  up to ten (10) years for somatic cell genetic effects in animals, usually rats and/or mice.  Endpoints which will be assessed include:
Task 1 - Micronuclei in bone marrow and/or other tissues (e.g. lung, spleen, peripheral lymphocytes).  Animals will be treated in the contract laboratory for these studies.
Task 2 - Micronuclei in peripheral erythrocytes from sub-chronic studies.  Animals will be treated in other laboratories and cells shipped to the contract laboratory for micronucleus scoring.
Task 3 - Centromeric probe analysis of micronuclei
Task 4 - Single cell gel electrophoresis assays of various tissues
Task 5 - Analysis of genetic toxicity information.  

New technology has automated the process of counting the number of micronuclei cells on slides and therefore a Flow Cytometer is required of the Offeror to perform this project.

The Government estimates that Tasks one (1) to four (4) will require approximately six (6) to seven (7) person-years per year.  Task five (5)  will require one (1) person-year per year and this position is will be on site at the NIEHS and office space, equipment, and materials will be provided by the government. The period of performance will be ten (10) years.   The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541710 and the small size standard is 500 employees or less.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Wake Forest University School of Medicine for continuation of the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS).  WHIMS is an ancillary study to the WHI Hormone Trials.  It is designed to study probable dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and global cognitive functioning in women 65 years of age and older participating in the E+P or E-alone hormone therapy trials.  Since the initiation of WHIMS in 1996, a total of 7,526 participants have been recruited, examined and followed to determine whether taking hormones (estrogen alone or estrogen plus progestin) would slow the decline of cognitive function in postmenopausal women.  Previous funding was provided by Wyeth Ayerst Pharmaceuticals.  The primary goals of the proposed continuation are (1) to complete the originally planned follow-up among women in the WHIMS E-only trial (2) continue the post-trial follow-up among women formerly enrolled in the WHIMS E+P trial to establish the impact of the cessation of E+P therapy on cognitive outcomes; and (3) provide analytical support to vigorously explore and publish WHIMS data.  The statutory authority applicable to this solicitation is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302.1.  The incumbent has the unique capability to provide the required services to the NHLBI.  See NOTE 22.

This new armor system must provide, at a minimum, a 35% weight reduction over the existing metallic armor system and display at least the same ballistic properties (V50: 30 cal., 7.62mm round @ 2750 FPS at an angle of 0 to +/- 80 deg, sustain multiple hits within 5.75in of previous impact point, no complete penetration allowed), environmental durability (Vibration: (4.4Hz @ 2IPS); Temperature: (-40 to 200F; -40 to 600F for engine area); Acceleration: 3Gs in all directions; Fluid Compatibility: Maintain structural and ballistic integrity after being soaked in JP-5, Hydraulic fluid, cleaning solvents, etc; Humidity: Maintain structural and ballistic integrity after being exposed to 100% humidity continuously)  and form/fit/function parameters of the existing metallic armor system.  The total weight of the existing metallic armor system is 560 pounds (308 pounds for the engine armor and 252 pounds for the flight control closet armor).  The estimated quantity is for this procurement is 145 kits or other such quantities as may be authorized and appropriated by Congress.   First delivery NLT Aug 2005, at a rate of 12 units per month (**larger quantities are acceptable**)  The POC for this requirement is Janice Woehrer, (301) 757-8971 or Julie Matheny, (301) 757-8945.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Re-Issuance of notice that was under DAAE30-03-BAA-0401. The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC intends to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)  for the development and system integration of a Small Arms Lightweight Family  of Weapons and Ammunition (LFWA). The LFWA will provide a lethality component  of the Objective Force Warrior (OFW) program.  The initial focus of the LFWA  program will be on developing lightweight machine gun and ammunition. The  objective is a "clean slate" approach that will yield ammunition and weapons  that are reproducible in quantity, robust, easy to operate and maintain, and  reliable under all conditions, while taking up less volume and weighing 30-40%  less than current systems. The contractor(s) shall devote their engineering and scientific skills to  conceive and design virtual prototypes of the entire family of weapons and ammunition, and shall fabricate, test and deliver non-working full scale models  of the proposed Light Machine Gun with inert ammunition and full up working  Light Machine Gun prototypes with live ammunition, as described in the BAA.   Each offeror’s proposal, to include proposed designs, should not be restricted  by current weapons, weapon mechanisms, ammunition or ammunition handling. Two major demonstrations of the new system are currently planned. The first  will be a non-firing demo in mid FY06 to support the OFW Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD). The second demonstration will be an early operational assessment using full-up weapons and live ammunition, scheduled to be held in  late FY07.   The planned period of performance is expected to be three Phases with Phase 1 consisting of nine months, Phase 2 consisting of twenty-eight months and Phase 3 consisting of five months.  There may be downselect criteria for both Phases 2 and/or 3 if multiple awards are made.  It is anticipated that a BAA will be released on or about 15 October 2003.   Refer to any attached documents for possible changes to the closing date and time. All responses to this notice shall be submitted in the English language. No telephone requests shall be honored.

In addition, the Contractor may be required to provide custom or specialized configurations and/or installations of such services and technology based upon the special or unique needs of customer agencies.  Such specialized and unique requirements shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: (1) both a totally managed, completely AES secure desktop-to-desktop, fully-functioned e-meeting service that resides within the customer agency’s architecture (inside the agency’s firewall for security purposes), and a totally managed external solution as stated for internal; (2) a custom designed multi-stage hardware configuration, which is purchased and owned by the Contractor, that will deliver a Government-requested minimum of “three 9’s” level of availability (system down no more than 1 hour each 1000 hours), including switches, routers, multiple server types, data storage devices and remote and off-site management capability; (3) management software that will allow for the dynamic allocation of hardware resources and provide great scalability and efficient use of all elements of the configuration; (4) adaptable and efficient use of the existing agency broadband capability; (5) interaction with existing basic biometric and/or “smart card” technology at VIA3 login upon Contractor/Government definition and mutual agreement of functional requirements; (6) Contractor-provided management capabilities to remotely manage and operate the VIA3 service, including on-site personnel, if required, to facilitate those functions where physical presence is required; (7)  electronic online e-learning educational courses and “getting started” guides, regular Level III client service and support service, and future software releases of VIS3 which shall be provided at no additional charge; (8) additional increases to the hardware configuration as the VIA3 user population incrementally grows; (9) facilitation of a multi-account structure within the Government/agency, and the implementation of all appropriate Government administrative management tools to initialize, audit, add, remove and move users within account groups; (10) software modifications which are designed specifically for Government use; (11) custom designed training/educational courses or programs; and (12) Government-directed de-installation and re-installation requirements necessitated by a Government change in the physical location of Contractor-managed hardware and any communication line services and related costs, including tariff and connection charges and any future modifications to same.

Firms must submit a description of their proposal in sufficient technical detail to substantiate the ability of an alternative service to meet all of these requirements.  Submissions should be sent to Sandy J. George, Contract Specialist, at the contracting office address listed above.  If no affirmative written response is received within 15 days after publication of this notice to the effect that a comparable service is available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining a service through the proposed contractor, a sole-source award will be negotiated.  No solicitation document is available.  Requests for a solicitation document will not be considered an affirmative response.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is seeking Offerors who have the capability to test approximately twenty-five (25) chemicals per year  up to ten (10) years for somatic cell genetic effects in animals, usually rats and/or mice and 50 chemicals per year in the bacteria assay for point mutations.  Endpoints to be assessed will include:
Task 1 - Micronuclei in bone marrow and/or other tissues (e.g. lung, spleen, peripheral lymphocytes).  In these studies, animals will be treated in the contract laboratory.
Task 2 - Micronuclei in peripheral erythrocytes from sub-chronic studies.  In these studies,  animals will be treated in other laboratories and cells will be shipped to the contract laboratory for micronucleus scoring.
Task 3 - Centromeric probe analysis of micronuclei
Task 4 - Single cell gel electrophoresis assays of various tissues
Task 5 - Point mutations is salmonella TA98, 100 and 102
Task 6- The Government anticipates a need for work for assay development equivalent to 5% of the work required to perform tasks 1 to 5.
Task 7 - Analysis of genetic toxicity information   

New technology has automated the process of counting the number of micronuclei cells on slides and therefore a Flow Cytometer is required of the Offeror to perform this project.

<DESC>In reference to the announcement, reference number 2003-10036B, inviting submission of qualifications and proposal data to develop a feasibility study for upgrading and expanding the Amilcar Cabral International Airport Upgrade and Expansion for Aeroportos E Seguranca Aérea (Grantee); the new deadline for submission of bids has been extended from 12:00 noon (local time), 17 October 2003, to 12 noon (local time), 24 October 2003.

Proposal Submission Place stays the same.

POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place: Mr. Mario Paixao Lopes, President, Administrative Council, Aeroportos E Seguranda Aérea, P.O. Box 58, Island of Sal, Republic of Cabo Verde, Phone: 238-412-626, Fax: 238-411-570  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the expansion and upgrade of Amilar Cabral International Airport in Sal, Cape Verde.  The Republic of Cape Verde, through its Aeroportos E Seguranda Aérea, has continued to develop the international airport on the Island of Sal in order to attract greater air traffic of both passengers and goods through the country.  ASA is keen to continue this development and as such requested that a U.S. firm conduct a feasibility study that will produce the roadmap for ASA to follow to continue its development of the airport.
 
The Amilcar International Airport (Sal Airport) is an ICAO Class 4E airport with a 3,306-meter runway with a pavement strong enough to handle an emergency landing of a U.S. space shuttle.  There is also a crosswind runway for smaller aircraft.  The main runway is equipped with a Category II (CAT II) Instrument Landing System (ILS) and the existing airfield lighting system is in the process of being replaced and upgraded to CAT II standards.  The airport has more than adequate ramp space and is currently handling 4E aircraft (the South African Airways 747-400).  

The existing passenger terminal, which has been modernized and enlarged in 2000, encompasses approximately 13,600 square meters of covered space and handles both international and domestic traffic in a single level passenger-processing configuration.  With the existing level of traffic, the terminal is already suffering from congestion in the domestic and international arrivals and departure areas.  In addition, the lack of boarding bridges at the terminals constitutes an inconvenience to tourists who have to climb and descend loading stairs on the apron.  The existing air cargo terminal is small with some 2,200 square meters of cargo handling space and 620 square meters of office space and is currently located in such a manner that it limits the future expansion of the passenger terminal.

The airport has greatly upgraded its security and is on the point of being classified as Category I in this regard by the FAA and ICAO.  In addition, Cape Verde will be the first country in Africa to fully implement CNS/ATM (a new air traffic control center is under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of 2003).  With the assistance of IATA, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) procedures have been developed for Cape Verde’s airports and a specific GNSS approach procedure has been adopted for the Sal Airport.  These improvements are providing the most secure air operations environment possible.

The Sal Airport will continue to be the main international airport and hub for Cape Verde.  A new airport for Praia is expected to open in late 2003 or early 2004, which will be capable of handling direct flights to Lisbon but not to further European destinations such as Germany, Italy and France, which currently constitute the main sources of tourism.  Additionally, this airport will not be able to handle transatlantic flights.

The feasibility study consists of an improvement and expansion to the Sal International Airport and is planned for implementation over the next five years.  The key components of the project include:

·	A new air cargo facility to support a cargo hub for West Africa-U.S. traffic and an expansion to the existing international and domestic passenger terminal to serve rapidly increasing tourism.  Currently, the existing cargo terminal is too small and blocks the expansion of the passenger terminal.  
·	A passenger terminal expansion, transforming the existing terminal into a two level operation with boarding bridges to meet international passenger demand, which has been estimated by International Air Transport Association (IATA) to triple to reaching a total of 1.4 million passengers over the next ten years.  
·	Reconfiguration and possible expansion of the aircraft parking apron, the provision of a new apron with connecting taxiways for the new cargo terminal.
·	The replacement of existing obsolete crash fire trucks.

The selected contractor will be responsible for completing the following tasks:

The terms of reference (TOR) for this project include 11 tasks:

1)	Collection and Review of Existing Data, Airport Inspection and Interviews
2)	Forecast of Demand for Passengers and Cargo
3)	Analysis of Airport Condition and Demand/Capacity and Development of Facility Requirements
4)	Conceptual Plans and Development Program
5)	Environmental Impact Analysis
6)	Capital Costs and Investment Requirements 
7)	Financial Analysis and Plan
8)	Concession Strategy
9)	Opportunities for the Participation of U.S. Suppliers
10)	USTDA Briefing
11)	Preparation and Submission of Reports

A more detailed description of the Terms of Reference can be found in Annex II to this RFP.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $291,650 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 12:00 p.m., Friday, October 17, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

2. The following are answers to questions that have been received to date:


Q1:	[As stated in the synopsis] “If a firm will use multiple offices, for each of the criteria requiring ability and experience, show project experience for each specific office and list the personnel in that office who would be assigned to perform the work.”  This first question is what is the definition of “firm.”  Does this include all of [name of contractor] and our subconsultants?  [Name of contractor] has over 35 offices nationwide and our potential subconsultants have multiple offices.

A1:	In accordance with FAR 36.102, “firm” in conjunction with architect-engineer services, means any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the professions of architect or engineering.

Q2:	The solicitation requests a limit on the number of resumes in Block 7 to 10 resumes.  If we have multiple offices, do we submit separate SF 255s for each office (submit a set of Block 7 resumes for each office limited to 10 resumes for each office?)

A2:	Only one (1) Standard Form 255 should be provided for each submission.  As such, a total of no more than 10 resumes can be provided.

Q3:	The solicitation requests that for each office show project experience and list the personnel in that office who would be assigned to perform the work.  Where does this listing of personnel fit into the SF 255?  Do we submit a separate Item 8 for each office to show the project experience for that office?

A3:	Block 8 of the SF 255 can be used to show project experience (see limitations for Block 8 as specified in the original synopsis).    A listing of personnel can be shown in the organizational chart.

Q4:	Item 10 of the SF 255 shall be limited to one single-sided page…”  Is the organizational chart the only item to be provided in Item 10.  Generally Item 10 can be used to provide supporting discussion particularly to address each of the 7 evaluation factors?

A4:	The organizational chart can be provided as a one page supplement to the standard form (as can the list of references requested by the original synopsis).    Block 10 of the SF 255 can be used in any means seen fit by the firm (see page and font size limitations as specified in the original synopsis).

Q5:	[Evaluation Factor 6] Location of the firm within the package area and the firm’s knowledge of the package area….  [Contractor’s name] has several offices in the package area we are considering.  The question is what about subconsultants…does this criteria hold for subconsultants or just the prime?

A5:	This criteria does not apply for subconsultants.  The original synopsis reads “the FIRM must have an office located within the geographical boundary of the package area.”

Q6:	[From the synopsis language] Firms interested in being considered to perform this work are required to submit (1) original and….for one, and only one, of the packages.  Submissions of multiple packages will result in all submittals for the firm to be discarded.”  Does this statement apply to a firm who wants to go as a prime on one package and also be subconsultants on another package?  Can a firm be a subconsultant on multiple packages?

A6:	In accordance with the revised synopsis language, firms may provide submissions for either or both package areas.  However, firms may only provide one submission per package area.  This limitation would apply to subconsultants/subcontractors as well as prime contractors.


Please note that the reference to “in house” made in the announcement refers to a prime (or joint venture) contractor but does not refer to subcontractors/subconsultants.

STATEMENT OF WORK
DMLSS-FACILITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SUSTAINMENT SPECIALISTS
NAVY BUREAU OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
FACILITIES DIVISION (M3M3)

1.0  Background

As a result of the Functional Process Improvement Review of 1994, the Defense Medical Standard Support Automated Information System (DMLSS-AIS) was developed to support medical logistics management practices throughout the Military Healthcare System (MHS).  DMLSS-Facility Management (DMLSS-FM) is a component of this system that provides standardized facility and plant assets management capabilities throughout Navy Medicine with:

·	Work Request / Work Order Management
·	Operations & Maintenance Management
·	Space and Assets Management
·	Project Management 
·	Regulatory Compliance (RC)
·	Computer Aided Drafting & Design (CADD) Functionality
·	Various integrated Commercial off the shelf (COTS) products 

DMLSS-FM is presently deployed to approximately 30 MTFs, managing approximately 10 million square feet of Navy Medicine’s nearly 16 million square feet of total assets.  As DMLSS-FM is established as the mandatory standard facility management AIS throughout Navy Medicine, and as implementation of the DMLSS/Maximo IO occurs, the need for qualified DMLSS-FM implementation trainers and support personnel will become paramount.  Therefore, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, Facilities (M3M3) has an immediate need to establish worldwide DMLSS activation and support services for system implementation and training; database support; drawing usability, conversion and integration; and front-line functional support for Navy MTFs.

<DESC>****************MODIFICATION FOR SECOND PART******************
Due to the critical importance of the Autoclave Electronic Control System (AECS) to Depot operations, only contractors with strong past performance in state of the art computer hardware and software upgrade capabilities should respond.  In addition, this requirement is time sensitive and all proposals should emphasize the ability of the contractor to rapidly design, manufacture, install, and acceptance test the upgrades within the shortest timeframe possible, thereby minimizing the potential for the NADEP to experience work stoppage due to downtime.  The contractor shall deliver to:  UIC N65886, Naval Air Depot, Building 101, Code 62338, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, FL 32212-0016.  Inspection and acceptance shall be at destination, FOB destination.  
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  In making its award determination, the Government will first determine whether an offeror's proposal satisfies the Government's technical requirements as contained in this RFP.  If an offeror's proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable, the proposal will be rejected and not considered for award.  Once the technical acceptability determinations are completed, all offerors' proposals with an upgrade program determined to meet the Government's technical requirements will be evaluated considering the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:
Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Warranty
Past Performance
Price
Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Warranty and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.  Furthermore, time is of the essence and Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Warranty, individually, is more important than either Past Performance or Price.  
Delivery, installation and acceptance testing of the AECS upgrade are critical to ensuring continued production capability at the NADEP.  As such, proposals that contain an accelerated delivery schedule will receive a more favorable evaluation under the Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Warranty factor.  
For the Past Performance factor, the offeror shall describe its past performance on similar or related contracts it has held within the last five (5) years which are similar to the requirements in this RFP or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant related or similar past performance. Offerors who present similar contracts should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts to the requirements of this RFP. The offeror should provide the following information regarding its past performance:
1.  Contract Number(s),
2.  Name and phone number of a point of contact at the federal, state, local government or commercial entity for which the contract was performed,
3.  Dollar value of the contract,
4.  Detailed description of the work performed,
5.  Names of subcontractor(s) used, if any, and a description of the extent of work performed by the subcontractor, and  
6.  The number, type and severity of any quality, delivery or cost problems in performing the contract, the corrective action taken and the effectiveness of the corrective action.

If an offeror's proposal is determined to be unacceptable in either the Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Warranty factor or the Past Performance factor, the proposal will be rejected and not considered for award.  The Government reserves the right to award the contract to other than the lowest priced offeror.  
The following FAR clauses are incorporated by reference and apply to this acquisition:  52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors- Commercial Items (Oct 2000); 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (Feb. 2002); 52.233-3, Protest After Award (Aug 1996); and 52.244-6, Subcontracts for Commercial Items (May 2002).

<DESC>Amendment 0002 to solicitation SP0600-03-R-0160 is hereby incorporated to include the following:  Line item 3000a has been updated on Attachment III to include offers for renewable energy. The following notes have been deleted : The Government is soliciting various unit prices per kWh in addition to the one requiring 0% of the total quantity to consist of renewable energy that exceeds the mandatory state requirement. Offerors are encouraged to submit offer prices for the following levels of renewable energy. For evaluation purposes, the Government will compare the nonrenewable offers with the renewable offers. The Government may be willing to pay a premium for renewable energy, based upon the resources available to the installations and the amounts of the premium differentials. 
The following note has been added to CLAUSE M800 PRICE EVALUATION (ELECTRICITY)(DESC AUG 2003): RENEWABLE ENERGY NOTE:  The government is soliciting offers for renewable energy exceeding the mandatory state requirement.  The following installations request renewable energy offers and have set aside the following amount of money for the incremental cost of purchasing of renewable energy.  Malmstrom AFB has set aside $100,000 for the purchase of renewable energy.  Offerors interested in providing renewable energy must identify the source of the energy (the percentage of biomass, wind, solar, etc.), the price per kwh and the number of kwh of renewable energy offered. Offers will be evaluated on the basis of the lowest weighted average cost of energy including renewable and non-renewable sources. The RFP is available through the DESC-APE electricity web site: http://www.desc.dla.mil/DCM/DCMSolic.asp?SolicID=593
      If you are unable to access the solicitation via the Internet, please contact DESC-APE for a printed                 copy.  For all Small Business issues, please call Ms. Kathy Williams at (703) 767-9465 or Kathy.S.Williams@dla.mil.

<DESC>Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center, in partnership with the Defense Supply Center Richmond, will host a Joint Accessories Industry Day on 28 Oct, 2003 at 9:00 AM through 3:00 PM Central Standard Time, at the Reed Center in Midwest City, OK. Sign in will be at 8:00 AM. This is an advertisement for the Industry Day only and no solicitation is available at this time. Any resulting procurement action will be the subject of a separate, future announcement. The Government will not reimburse attendees for any costs associated with participation and is under no obligation to award any contract associated with this event. The following information is provided for discussion purposes and any potential strategy for this acquisition may change prior to any solicitation release. The purpose of this interactive Industry Day is to identify Purchasing and Supply Chain Management (PSCM) best practices for Federal Stock Class 1680, which encompasses a variety of miscellaneous Aircraft accessories. 
A Joint Accessories Commodity Council has been formed, and will be pursuing the development of an AFMC enterprise sourcing strategy, which could result in contractual documents for new purchases and repairs for FSC 1680 items managed by the USAF and DLA. The goals of any forthcoming sourcing strategy will be to improve readiness, increase responsiveness of the supply chain and reduce costs.
 Industry input into the strategy development process is critical for the Government to understand the supply base capabilities related to achieving the above objectives. The Industry Day format will include a Government presentation on Purchasing and Supply Chain Management (PSCM), a general question and answer session, and a joint wrap up session. Suppliers are requested to identify improvements allowing the Government to meet the stated objectives. 
Suppliers interested in attending and/or presenting are requested to email or fax notice to participate no later than 20 Oct 03.  There will be a $25 conference fee for each attendee. The government anticipates releasing through this website one or more strategies as a result of this industry day, for supplier review and comment on by the end of Dec. 03. A follow-on Industry Day is currently anticipated for late Jan. 04.

<DESC>NA MARKET SURVEY: DEVELOPMENT OF AMPLIFIED FLUORESCENCE QUENCHING POLYMER-BASED SENSORS FOR MINE DETECTION.  The U.S. Army Communications and Electronics Command (CECOM) Acquisition Center-Washington (CAC-W) on behalf of the US Army RDECOM, CERDEC, Night Visi on and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Science and Technology Division, Countermine Branch is conducting market research to identify contractors having qualification and capabilities to conduct testing of an Amplified Fluorescence-Quenching Polymer  (AFP) sensor as discussed below.  The goal of this endeavor is to determine the viability of AFP-based chemical sensors to sample and detect the chemical signature of a buried landmine in the vapor headspace and the surrounding soil and to further develop  a field portable chemical sensor, operating on the principles of AFP interaction with target chemicals that is capable of being deployed on handheld and remote platforms.  The Government is planning on awarding a contract in the second quarter of the gove rnment fiscal year 2004 with an estimated period of performance of 24 months (subject to availability of funds).Performance Objectives:  Detection of at least 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, 2,6-dinitrotoluene, 4-aminodinitrotoluene, 2-aminodini trotolene at concentration levels at or below 1 mg of analyte per 1 L of air or 1 mg of analyte per 1kg of soil.  Detection of plastic cased anti-tank and antipersonnel landmines.  Technical Objectives:  (a) test and evaluate an AFP sensor capable of the p erformance objectives listed above;  (b) improvement of the AFP formula and performance,  (these improvements should include, but not be limited to, AFP signal-to-noise ratios, performance in the presence of interference, application of AFP material to sen sor components.);  (c) development of technologies that sample chemical signals available in soil above and around buried landmines;  (d) demonstration of  capability to integrate their sensor onto a remotely operated vehicle and propose a method of integr ation for their sensor with other countermine technologies (i.e. acoustics, GPR, etc.). Tests and Demonstrations:  During this 24 month effort the contractor shall pursue the technical objectives listed above.  In this effort the contractor shall demonstra te the performance of a field portable sensor capable of meeting the performance objectives.  The contractor shall also visit Government chosen test sites and collect data over landmines that have been buried for a known time period.   The first test shall  be conducted no later than 3 months after the contract start date.  The U. S. Army is interested in receiving white papers outlining proposed research and development testing of an AFP. This is NOT a request for proposals.  White papers should be limited to no more than ten (10) pages and should  include a summary of related corporate experience, and a specific development plan.  Contractors who can satisfy the Government's requirements are urged to provide a white paper by October 24, 2003 supporting the claim that the contractor presently has the capability to perform the required work.  The white paper  should contain resumes of the contractor's relevant technical and management personnel, and sufficient technical details should be provided to detail the  contractor's experience in development of AFP-based sensors, and other evidence supporting the claim.  The Government will consider all white papers submitted on time.  The contractor shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses.   All responses shall be prepared in MS Word and submitted electronically to the CECOM-CAC-W Gail Fair, Contract Specialist, via email at wanda.fair@cacw.army.mil, 703-325-6093.  All requests for further information must be in writing or via email, telepho ne requests for additional information will not be honored.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information
<DESC>This serves as a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION Notice.  The Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP), (formerly the Office for State & Local Domestic Preparedness Support) is the program office within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) responsible for enhancing the capacity of state and local jurisdictions to respond to, and mitigate the consequences of, incidents of domestic terrorism. The mission of ODP is to develop and implement a national program to enhance the capacity of state and local agencies to respond to incidents of domestic terrorism, particularly those involving Weapons of Mass Destruction, through coordinated training, equipment acquisition, technical assistance, and support for Federal, state, and local exercises. Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC-SD) provides support to ODP in its mission.  SSC-SD?s Signal Processing and Communication Technology Branch, code 2855 provides system engineering, management, and planning of technical efforts for communications architecture assessments, requirements analysis for interoperable communications and interoperable communications solution options, through the Interoperable Communications Technical Assistance Program (ICTAP). Code 2855?s support is guided by a Memorandum of Agreement between ODP, DHS and SSC-SD. SPAWAR Systems Center San Diego, Code 2855, is seeking information for an Off-The-Shelf (OTS) communications control system capable of handling anti-terrorism activities that are conducted jointly by local and state law enforcement agencies and first responders. Joint investigations and operations require a system that will allow shared communications between each agency involved. Presently, local and state law enforcement agencies and first responders often encounter incompatibility problems related to radio communications and the exchange of computer data. Thus, dissimilar radio frequencies and mismatches in digital data transfer systems often cause severe communications problems which can defeat a well planned mission and lead to extreme hazards for the agents and innocent civilians. The communication control system sought will be required to: utilize existing radios, repeaters, frequencies, and/or encryption; communicate in real-time, utilizing mobile and hand-held radios; and simultaneously handle multiple users on separate operations. The communications control system must accommodate the operations of each agency no matter what types of radio systems they employ. The activation could be accomplished remotely through the control system or through a dispatcher who would manually connect the agencies. Once the program is operational, whether using new or modifying existing technology, the system's design must facilitate use by any cooperating law enforcement agency. The initial capability will be for an interoperability project requiring a system capable of operating over the following ranges and modes: VHF, UHF, 800 MHz analog and trunked systems (both Motorola and Ericsson), telephones and encrypted networks. The system must be capable of being expanded in the number of radios linked.  At least 12 radios would need to be interfaced simultaneously at each site.  Additional features may also be provided for recording of selected communications, mobile system configuration, automatic squelch, enhanced voice quality, and conferencing.  The capability to include data, real-time video, and image transmissions is desired but not required. This Request for Information announcement will be open through 10 April 2004. The Government will review information as it?s received.  The respondent should provide as a minimum: (1) physical and functional description of the OTS system being offered; (2) performance description and specifications of the system; (3) if possible, include cost of the system or technology now and anticipated in the future with further development; (4) if not yet in production, provide the development status and anticipated schedule for completion and (5) Type of business, (i.e. large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, other small business, etc).  This announcement is a request for information for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be issued.   However, the information will be utilized for technical and acquisition planning. It is recognized that cost information that is provided by the vendor is for planning purposes and as such the vendors will not be bound to this cost information.  Vendors may be asked to provide an SSC-SD defined demonstration at the vendor's location, at no cost to the government, resulting in a report back to the vendor regarding the findings of the demonstration. The government invites comments related to possible purchase or acquisition strategies. If there is a GSA or other contract vehicle already available for the technology being proposed, please include this information in the response. All data received in response to this RFI marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected from release outside the government. It is not the intent of SSC-SD to reimburse providers for the cost of submitting information in response to this RFI. Please direct any questions via e-mail to the POC, Lila Defensor (lila.defensor@navy.mil). To be beneficial, interested parties should submit any applicable information via electronic transmission via the SSC SD E-Commerce at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>75 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.  
The Committee has been asked to add the following items for the GSA Multiple Award Schedules 70 and 75 II A:  CDs and DVDs (7045-00-NIB-0192; 7045-00-NIB-0192; 7045-00-NIB-0914; 7045-00-NIB-0196; 7045-00-NIB-0197; 7045-00-NIB-0198; 7045-00-NIB-0199; 7045-00-NIB-0200; and 7045-00-NIB-0201), Folder, Double Pocket Presentation (7530-00-NIB-0698 – Black In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm's sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.

<SUBJECT>99 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed service(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Service(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.  
The Committee has been asked to consider adding: Preparation of Reports of Investigation and Prepare Final Agency Decisions for the Office of Civil Rights, Department of Transportation, Washington, DC. This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Services added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency (ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company's overall financial status.  

In determining whether a service is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the service(s) to the Government.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm's sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a service, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 
To determine whether the addition of the service(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee considers its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the services being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 
When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding services to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there is no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed service(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.

<DESC>THIS IS A REISSUANCE OF PRESOLICITATION NOTICE 674-03-007.  
IT IS BEING REISSUED AS NO RESPONSIVE BIDDERS WERE RECEIVED.
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement USAID/South Africa’s (USAID/SA) new Integrated Education Program (IEP) which is targeted to improve access to quality education for South Africa’s historically disadvantaged population.  The IEP will be implemented in the four target provinces:  Eastern Cape (EC), Northern Cape (NC), KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and Limpopo (LP). The Mission has developed parameters for a new primary education-focused activity that integrates and creates synergies with ongoing training and higher education activities, the IEP. The new IEP will build on the lessons learned and best practices developed over the course of the program, namely, (i) use of a holistic approach to school development, especially governance which must involve communities; (ii) emphasis on leadership development at both school and district levels; and (iii) provision of support to clusters of schools, rather than individual schools. Under the anticipated contract, the contractor will be expected to contribute to the achievement of the following key objectives in order to assist USAID/South Africa to attain the result of improved quality of primary education, with a specific focus on improving the system’s capacity to deliver quality math and science programs. Those objectives are: (i) enhanced capacity of teachers (targeted to the teaching of literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science; (ii) effective implementation of Curriculum 2005 (C2005), with a focus on literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science curriculum; and (iii) improved educational management and enhanced school governance. The stated objectives are consistent with the National Department of Education (NDoE) and those of other local and international development partners. USAID/South Africa anticipates awarding one performance based contract for a three year period using full and open competition. The government estimate is $23m with an additional $5.6 pending.  The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the Government-wide point of entry (GPE). This presolicitation notice can be viewed and downloaded using http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The solicitation, once issued, can be downloaded from the GPE.  You are encouraged to access the solicitation via the Internet as this eliminates possible delays associated with mailing, in general, and particularly from overseas Missions.  You must confirm in writing to the contact person noted above that you have received this solicitation document and you are responsible for ensuring that you have received it from the Internet in its entirety.

<DESC>Statement of Work:  The intent of this solicitation is to acquire consulting services that will result in a comprehensive strategic plan for increasing and strengthening funding sources to support the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument.  Contract time is estimated to be 90 days.

An Act of Congress created the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument in 1982.  The Act directed the USDA-Forest Service to manage the 110,000-acre area to provide for the natural recovery, scientific research and interpretive and recreational facilities and programs to the public. 

The Monument hosts visitors from around the world.  It is located between the Seattle, WA and Portland, OR metropolitan areas.  Existing services include, among other things, 3 visitor centers, 3 major interpretive sites, 16 minor interpretive sites, 5 Monument entry points, picnic areas, viewpoints, boat launches, climbing bivouacs, horse camps, snow parks and trails.

Expenditures for Monument services are essentially funded half by agency appropriations and half by fee collections.  Theses sources are augmented somewhat by volunteers and relatively small partnerships and grants, including a currently inactive Mt. St. Helens Institute.  Agency funding has declined and the future of the Recreation Fee Demo authority is uncertain.  Agency authorities for fundraising are extremely limited and the National Forest Foundation currently lacks capacity to assist us.  Many Monument programs are facing severe under-funding—particularly maintenance of facilities, exhibits, trails and interpretive programs.  We increasingly look for additional funding sources to accomplish our program of work.  This situation is the basic reason behind this request for quotes.

The successful contractor will, as a minimum, develop a strategic resource development plan, complete with alternatives and recommendations.  The focus of this plan is an enhanced (possibly diversified) and sustainable revenue strategy to support the delivery of Monument programs.  We anticipate the most successful plan will incorporate a strategy for leveraging the 25th anniversary of Mt. St. Helens (May, 2005)—and possibly also the 200th anniversary of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and the 100th anniversary of the US Forest Service (also 2005). 

Work will likely include a review of all essential statistics, findings and reports related to the Monument and interviews with key staff and stakeholders.  A full tour of the Monument’s major recreation sites should be anticipated.  

Period of Contract:   90 days after Notice to Proceed. 

Evaluation Factors for award are:  1. Record of past performance:  Includes customer satisfaction, quality of final product(s), creativity and innovativeness of approach.  Submit project names and phone numbers of references, including only projects completed in the last 3 years.  2.  Qualifications and experience of key personnel:  Includes education, work experience, accomplishments of a similar nature.  Include only information about personnel to be assigned to this project.  3.  Work Plan:  Submit outline of proposed approach to this project.  Provide enough detail for evaluation purposes:  who, what, where, when, why and how.  4.  Price.  Include a breakdown of price, including direct labor, materials, overhead and profit.  Price is considered to be less important than technical factors, which are of equal importance to each other.  The Government reserves the right to make technical/price trade-offs.  Award may not be to the lowest priced offer, nor to the highest rated, depending on price/technical tradeoffs.  Award will be to that firm the Government determines to be the Best Value, these factors considered.  Award may be made on initial offers, though discussions may be held.

Incentives:  After award, and when the final product is delivered, the successful contractor whose end product is determined to be of outstanding quality may be offered additional collateral contract work valued at up to $25,000 without further competition.
   
The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, Commercial Items apply to this solicitation.

The provisions at 52.212-2, Evaluation – Commercial Items apply to this solicitation.
Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items, with their offer.

The Clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items, applies to this solicitation.

The Clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes, or Executive Orders – Commercial Items, also applies to this solicitation.  The Service Contract Act, wage determination # WA 1994-2441 Rev. #20 dated 05/30/2003 also applies to this solicitation.  Those clauses incorporated by reference are:  FAR Clauses 52.219-8, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222.35, 52.222.36, 52.222.37, 52.232-33, 52-222-41, 52.22-42, 52.22243, 52.22-44.  (End of Clauses)
